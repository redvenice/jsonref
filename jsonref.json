One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show, released a statement criticizing Barr\u0027s racist tweet  Weighing in: Gilbert, who is a producer on the reboot, let her disgust be known on TuesdayBut Fishman was not the only original cast member to take a stand, with Sara Gilbert, who played Roseanne\u0027s daughter Darlene, also releasing a statement that very much echoed the one released shortly after by ABC cancelling the show.\u0027Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert, who was a producer on the reboot and largely responsible for reuniting the cast.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027A downcast Gilbert was photographed on her phone outside an LA restaurant yesterday as John Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the show, looked similarly bereft as he walked his dog in New Orleans.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/15/4CC1DAEB00000578-0-image-m-21_1527689211545.jpg","title":"The Queen placed handbag chair meeting George Brandis means","story":"    A handbag (circled) on a side chair at Buckingham Palace could be a good omen for Australia\u0027s relations with the QueenRoyal historian Hugo Vickers has previously spoken of how the monarch uses her bag to send secret signals to her staff to indicate when she\u0027s ready to move on from a conversation.Granny\u0027s pride and joy!

that a job opportunity I would have loved to apply to was only feasible for rich, London-based students.\u0027As a Labour member it was annoying as not only is it unfair that someone\u0027s not being paid for work but that it contradicts the labour manifesto on unpaid internships.\u0027Opportunities like this are only accessible for one type of student: rich.\u0027Kane added on Twitter: \u0027Who can afford an unpaid internship in London? Extremely disappointed @ChukaUmunna.\u0027Serge Valene responded: \u0027Someone living in London with their wealthy parents. Aside for that can\u0027t think who it\u0027ll be.\u0027George Bower demonstrated that not all internships have to be unpaid, tweeting: \u0027Ouch.\u0027That\u0027s not on.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                         In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals -

I am convinced that Abramovich made this decision with the approval and possibly the explicit instructions of Putin.As we all know, Putin is cold-blooded and cut-throat when dealing with those who have offended him.He came to power 18 years ago through his unswerving commitment to crush Chechnya’s separatists. He went on to seize Crimea from Ukraine, is held responsible for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet carrying 298 people and his secret police goons have been accused of assassinating enemies such as tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko.In other words, Putin does not take kindly to being snubbed.The same applies to Abramovich, who learned the ways of the world at Putin’s feet.The friendship between the two men goes back nearly a quarter of a century.One persistent, though unconfirmed, rumour, is that when the ailing Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was looking for a successor in 1999, Abramovich – then a young man with powerful business allies – suggested that Putin should be made prime minister. Yeltsin did just that.  Roman Abramovich (left with ex-wife Dasha Zhukova), who was last pictured at Chelsea with Guus Hiddink in December (right), is said to have personally pulled the plug on the £1billion stadium plan after his visa row Abramovich, who started life in Moscow as a mechanic, selling retreaded tyres as a sideline, acquired substantial stakes in the oil and gas industries as the Communist state broke apart.If mystery surrounds some of his early business deals, there is no mystery about how he hangs on to his wealth: he maintains a tungsten-strength friendship with Putin.Putin never lets old enmities die, and Abramovich is the same. When Abramovich fell out spectacularly with his business associate Berezovsky, the pair faced each other in court in 2012.Berezovsky claimed £3billion in damages from Abramovich for intimidating him into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft.The Chelsea owner won the case, in which legal costs were estimated to be £100million. Asked if he felt Putin would be happy with the ruling, Berezovsky replied: ‘Sometimes I have the impression that Putin himself wrote this judgment.’Roman Abramovich\u0027s new Israeli passport WON\u0027T guarantee him...Roman Abramovich SCRAPS plans for Chelsea\u0027s new £1bn stadium...Share this articleOf course, Abramovich’s difficulties in obtaining a UK visa must be set in the context of the Salisbury poisonings and the subsequent major row between London and Moscow with the UK expelling 23 Russian diplomats.His decision to halt development plans at Chelsea fit a pattern and chime with Moscow’s bitterness over what it calls ‘insinuations’ from the British authorities around the Skripal case.While most of the Western world is convinced that Moscow orchestrated the attack on British soil, the Russian government refutes the allegations as groundless.All this strongly suggests that a message is being sent from Moscow to London – and that Abramovich is the messenger.Chelsea fans may be upset about not getting a bigger stadium but this is becoming a much wider and more dangerous game. That said, Putin understands how powerful a weapon sport can be.          Mr Abramovich is a known ally of Vladimir Putin and has found his visa application at the centre of a row between Theresa May and the Russian President over the Salisbury poisoningHe cynically turned the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the Black Sea coast, into a gigantic ego-trip for himself. He will do exactly the same with this month’s football World Cup which he is hosting in Russia.But he is offended by criticism of Russia’s human rights record and can’t be happy that Prince William and British politicians will not attend the tournament – a decision made following the Salisbury poisonings.To some extent, Abramovich’s behaviour is blatant retaliation on behalf of his buddy in the Kremlin.I believe this might be just the start of Abramovich’s cold-shouldering of Britain.If Britain doesn’t want him, he doesn’t want Britain.Asked once where he considered home, he said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow, I feel most comfortable.’That love of London has died.Just before Christmas, amid claims that the Russian government had meddled in the Brexit referendum, Putin’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov admitted: ‘It’s no secret that our relations are at a low point.’Without doubt, after the Salisbury poisonings and Abramovich’s eruption yesterday, it’s clear that relations have got much lower.Mark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/22/4CCC365000000578-0-image-a-6_1527803010343.jpg","title":"Thousands fly UK arent asked passports","story":"    Airport blunders have allowed up to 11,000 passengers over the last five years to enter Britain without going through passport control, figures show.The problem has been blamed on human errors such as incorrect doors being opened at arrival gates.More than 11,000 did not have their passports checked in the usual way from 2013 to the end of 2017 immediately after landing.Figures released by the Home Office show that 2,328 were misdirected last year – an average of six a day.

How hard could it be, we asked? As it turned out, very, very hard indeedIt’s a sight that makes you want to jam on a pair of wellies, grab a rake, and start pulling the rubbish out yourself.So the Mail, which has campaigned for ten years against the scourge of plastic bags, decided to try to do just that.Inspired by our wildly successful Great Plastic Pick Up, which saw thousands take part in nationwide litterpicks, we set out to get the Don cleaned up. How hard could it be, we asked? As it turned out, very, very hard indeed.LOUISE ATKINSON kept a diary of what happened next . . .May 7, 2018The Mail runs the picture, taken on May 4, on its front page — and there is outrage. John Hourston from the campaigning group Blue Planet Society said: ‘This is the worst picture of pollution in a British river I’ve ever seen and a real wake-up call. The majority of the litter is single-use plastic.’The problem started after heavy rains in April washed floating debris into the water.As the Don flows through Doncaster it splits into numerous channels and waterways designed to stop flooding. At two points along the river’s length the current is artificially slowed.One is just by the Don Aqueduct, where the front-page picture was taken, and the other is at the back of Doncaster Prison, 15 minutes further downstream. Both spots are disgusting soups of plastic rubbish. I’m keen to tackle both.May 8REVEALED: Child is found alive in house of horrors where...EXCLUSIVE - Kimberly Guilfoyle and Don Jr. rush into dinner...Share this articleI start my inquiries, full of optimism that I can get this sorted — fast! Surely all I need is a gang of can-do volunteers, a couple of canoes and a very large roll of rubbish bags?So I check with charity Keep Britain Tidy and deputy chief executive Richard McIlwain stops my plans in their tracks: it seems I haven’t thought about today’s ever present health-and-safety rules.‘Many people are horrified at the state of our precious waterways and want to do something about it,’ he says. ‘But there can be real danger working in rivers.’He suggests first calling the Environment Agency, a government body in charge of public land and responsible for managing flooding and pollution. So I call its 24-hour incident hotline (finding the number takes some doing) to report the mess — and ask whether I can help clear it up. The hotline operative gives me an incident number and tells me to call General Enquiries in 20 minutes once my report has been logged to see if they’ll put me through to a Yorkshire-based officer. I do as I am told, but the phone operater seems perplexed. The Yorkshire-based duty officer would be the person to decide whether to accept help from the public, he says, but it was unlikely. This is all academic anyway as he won’t put me through to the duty officer.I asked if anything would be done about the horrifying mess I’d reported. He said I’d get ‘feedback within ten days’, which seems a long time to wait.That’s when I spot that a Yorkshire Environment Agency officer has tweeted the Mail’s pictures of the Don with a message: ‘I’ve taken a few reports this week of plastic and rubbish building up. We are working with landowners to get the waste removed ASAP for environmental reasons.’I send a message to him to ask how the clear-up is progressing and if he needs a hand. No reply.Surely I can do something?Keep Britain Tidy’s Richard next suggests trying the Canals And Rivers Trust, an independent charity funded by public money which has guardianship of our canals, rivers, reservoirs and docks and responsibility for keeping waterways open and useful for boats.          How shaming, then, that this image, which was published on the Mail’s front page a month ago, wasn’t taken in some impoverished part of the world but in Yorkshire — right in the middle of DoncasterOne of their employees tells me they hold clean-ups around Doncaster’s waterways twice a month but that there are no imminent plans to target the areas in the pictures.The problem for both spots, he reveals, is that any clean-up crew can’t just wade in and start pulling out plastic bottles. Any clean-up requires legal permission from whoever owns the land on the river bank as the crews will have to cross it to get to the rubbish. There also has to be a proper risk assessment and trained experts on hand for jobs like this.Establishing who owns the land is another headache. Doncaster Council says the site behind the prison isn’t theirs, and suggests I try the Land Registry website to establish ownership. The website is complex — and demands a £14.95 payment for any kind of access. Once I’ve logged in — and paid up — it can’t give me a clear answer who owns the land.May 9Having faced nothing but brick walls I decide to wield the Daily Mail’s muscle (admittedly not available to the average citizen) and try to bypass the hotlines and go straight to the top. So I call a press officer at Environment Agency HQ in London to tell him the Mail is offering to help clear it all up — and when can we start?He says he’ll look into it, and get back to me. He doesn’t. I’m beginning to get a little exasperated.Keep Britain Tidy’s Richard sympathises. He previously worked at the Environment Agency and tells me the Land Registry doesn’t log every piece of land ownership and besides, waterways are difficult. In the UK access to rivers is governed by ancient laws and any clean-up has to approved by whoever owns the land that abuts it.It might be the council, a private owner or any number of different bodies — from water firms to farms to nature reserves to foreign companies — he says.What’s more, if they only own one river bank that permission will only reach to precisely half way across the river.Stretch over the halfway point to grab an empty bottle and you could be treading on someone else’s toes so you need permission from both sides. ‘Access to rivers in England is a big bone of contention. It can sometimes be ridiculous,’ he adds wearily.You don’t say.May 10One river bank at the prison site lies at the back of the prison and the other has a small industrial estate beside it. I email the prison. No response. So I call the switchboard. The operator suggests I try the prison press office. The press officer tells me it’s not prison land — the prison merely operates on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. So I call the Ministry of Justice. They seem bemused. They ask me to email details, which I do.Then I try a bit of old-fashioned sleuthing. Holding a magnifying glass over the photo I can read the phone number on an advertising hoarding by a company called Eaton Commercial. Maybe they will know who owns the land? I call. The line is dead.May 14Just as the Great Plastic Pick Up is coming to its close I get a call from the national press officer for the Canals And Rivers Trust.She tells me they are responsible for only the towpaths and ensuring the water is navigable by boats. She says they aren’t responsible for rubbish left on or washing up on the banks — that’s a problem for the landowners, she says or my old friends the Environment Agency. ‘We’re not the river authority there,’ she says, adding, ‘It can be quite complex.’          It showed part of the River Don, which flows for nearly 70 miles from the Pennines through Sheffield and Rotherham before flowing out into the Humber Estuary — meaning this trash was headed straight out to seaMay 18I’m starting to wonder if we can speed things up a bit by offering to hire a professional SWAT team of cleaners to go in and do the clean up.I ask the Canals And Rivers Trust and they respond by presenting a different aqueduct in Wakefield which they say has created a similar plastic build-up.This one doesn’t have the same tricky land ownership issues as the two Doncaster sites. ‘It got really bad last month after the rain,’ says the press officer, ‘and it is now becoming a target for anti-social behaviour, with bits of debris being set on fire.’She says her team have been quoted a staggering £40,000 by private clearance crews to clear it up. The Trust is a charity, and £40,000 is a big chunk of its budget.It also goes some way to help explain why the various different authorities are so unwilling to leap in and clear up a stretch of water if the clean-up cost could be someone else’s responsibility. With that kind of public money required, is it really surprising responsibility gets batted back and forth while these sites remain toxic?May 20The Bank Holiday weekend has been bringing out the crowds and in Doncaster town centre, the rubbish is building up. Now there are at least another thousand plastic bottles and dozens of partially deflated footballs among the old tyres and discarded gas canisters.The warm May weather has brought flies and the trapped water has become stagnant with patches of soupy green algae. The place stinks and is swarming with flies.May 24The Canals And Rivers Trust calls to tell me a team has carried out a routine inspection of the aqueduct and in so doing, cleared a small amount of the debris.When I point out the mind-boggling short-sightedness of leaving a load of plastic rubbish there until it presents a serious risk, the spokeswoman says: ‘We’d be very happy to work with the Environment Agency to ensure a bigger clear-up happens, but this is not something we can initiate.’I’m astounded. I’ve been talking to both bodies for the past three weeks: is it really up to me to act as cupid here and get the two parties to liaise?When I go back to the press office for the Environment Agency I get my first glimpse of a breakthrough.Their spokeswoman says: ‘Our role is flood risk and water quality,’ the press officer explains. ‘We sent engineers out there to check the rubbish hadn’t created a flood risk, and checked whether it was polluting the water (you can normally tell if it is foaming, changes colour or smells bad) and they were confident there was no risk of serious damage to the eco-system.‘Although we can assure people there is no immediate risk of flooding or water quality pollution, we will work with the landowners and council to get the waste removed.’ So something is being done? They wouldn’t confirm.I ask for details, a time scale, anything ... but hear nothing.May 25The Canals And River’s Trust says they’ve drawn a blank with the site behind the prison. ‘The river is not navigable here, so it wouldn’t be possible to send out volunteers on canoes, which we do in other places. It’s also not practical to do it by hand from land. The job would be to hire some kind of crane to grab it all.’I’m back at square one on that one. Richard is sympathetic to my plight: ‘Litter in our rivers is unsightly and causes harm to native wildlife, while of course providing the route to sea for much of our plastic litter. While accepting that issues of land ownership and responsibility can be complex, this can’t be a recipe for inaction.’But he says there are fine examples of partnerships working around the country, where Keep Britain Tidy, the Environment Agency and companies, such as Severn Trent Water and Anglian Water, work with local volunteers to get litter cleared from rivers. So it can be done.May 30A month has passed. I’m on the verge of giving up. Then I get a surprise call from a very helpful press officer at the Environment Agency who tells me things are moving forwards. ‘Our team has been contacting the landowners and the local council,’ she says.Next the Canals And Rivers Trust calls to say one of their engineers has revealed that the two bodies really are actually working together to come up with a plan for the prison site. And at the aqueduct, walkers have spotted diggers, an excavator and floating rubbish clearing barges in the river. Could something be happening at last?June 2The aqueduct has been cleared of rubbish — not a plastic bottle to be seen! A major clean-up operation successfully removed more than a ton of rubbish.I’m thrilled to see the site restored to its former beauty but saddened that it was very likely to be pressure from the Mail which made it happen, and at a staggering cost to the public purse.And still the job is only half done. Behind the prison the rubbish pile still mounts. Now there’s a door, a wooden palette, traffic cones all daubed in algae and buzzing with flies. A jogger stops, incredulous. ‘This is the worst litter I’ve ever seen,’ she says, ‘It’s like a landfill site. It’s vile.’It is so saddening that the Daily Mail’s fantastic Great Plastic Pick Up was able to galvanise communities across the country and generate a palpable sense of pride and responsibility for our public areas, but still, in some pockets of the country, random littering continues and remains choked by mind-numbingly, impenetrable bureaucracy to spoil all our best intentions — and scar our beautiful land.Postscript, June 2A call from the Canals And Rivers Trust with the best possible news — a joint clean up with the Environment Agency HAS been arranged for behind the prison. A two-week project will start on Tuesday and last up to two weeks. It is expected to load six or seven two-ton wagons with plastic trash which will be taken away to be sorted and recycled.My work here is done."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/11/4CCE8A8500000578-0-image-a-14_1527847817730.jpg","title":"Socialist Pedro Sanchez Spanish PM looks like Antonia Banderez close ally Corbyn","story":"Photogenic soon-to-be Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (pictured left), 46, is known as \u0027Mr Handsome\u0027 in Spain and is a close ally of British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

If you’re a small business you may not go in every week, but you will still need to go in for a serious discussion about a loan.’ When they shut a branch, banks must reveal how many customers rely on it under industry rules. They typically say the branches have only a handful of regular customers and are no longer cost-effective.But NatWest owner RBS classes a customer as regular only if they have been in for 23 weeks of the past 26.Lloyds’ criteria are even more restrictive, at 48 weeks out of 52 weeks each year.This means even someone who went in every week apart from Easter, Christmas and a two-week summer holiday may not be classed as regular customers.These definitions rule out many thousands of people who pop into a branch only once every couple of weeks – even though a branch closure would severely limit their access to basic services. It is also thought the figures count only those who make a transaction, meaning anyone who visits a branch for advice or information may not be included.          NatWest last month shut its branch in the busy town of Harpenden in HertfordshireDerek French, a former campaigner against unnecessary branch closures, who lives nearby, said: ‘It’s a baffling decision and the figures they quote are totally misleading.‘People here have voted with their feet and signed up with other banks instead.’ Mr French added that the decision struck him as a bad business move as well as damaging to customers.Local Tory MP Bim Afolami, had written to RBS boss Ross McEwan urging him to rethink the closure. He wrote: ‘This decision troubles me because of the number of thriving small and medium-sized businesses based here.‘Despite the shift towards online banking for personal current accounts, small and medium enterprises continue to rely on banking in branch.’ \u0027It\u0027s just so short-sighted\u0027Furious customers blasted Lloyds when it axed the last bank branch in town in Wilton, Wiltshire, as part of its drive to cut costs.It means users must travel almost four miles to Salisbury for basic banking – hitting shopkeepers as well as vulnerable elderly people who are unable to drive.In a statement justifying its decision to close the branch, Lloyds said it was used on a regular weekly basis by only 27 customers.

If the sun sets in the evening with a rosy glow, then there is likely to be sunshine the following morning.The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the West as they do in the UK.So, if it’s fine in the West, then beams from the sun — as it sets in that direction— can stream unhindered through the clear skies and light up any clouds drifting off to the East.Meanwhile, the saying, ‘red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’ is also usually right. A red sky appears early in the day as a result of the high-pressure weather system having already moved east. This means the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a windy low-pressure system and rain — falling on the shepherds’ flocks.PLANT PREDICTORSWhen the air gets humid in the hours before rain, many wild-flowers protectively close their petals.Typical are daisies. If the white petals are closed and you cannot see the yellow middle disc, it is not wise to hang out your washing.WHY STEMS SNAPMost plants are naturally stable enough to withstand heavy rainfall.However, so many varieties that we grow in modern gardens are unnaturally made to grow faster by being given artificial fertiliser. This leads to tall, fragile stems that are insufficiently woody. It is little wonder that they snap easily under stress.ALL HAIL A STORMYou can learn a lot about the life-story of a hailstone by slicing it in half.It has a layered structure similar to the rings in tree trunks — both showing their age. Hailstones are formed in storm clouds. As they are pulled up several miles into the sky by strong wind currents, more water accumulates on their outsides and they freeze, making them bigger.When the strength of the wind drops in the highest altitudes, the hailstones fall back down into the stormy zone, where the updraught again thrusts them upward.Each time they do this they get bigger until, finally, they become too heavy to be kept in the air by wind currents and they drop to the ground.Each layer of ice is created by a single ‘up and down’ journey through the storm cloud. For example, five rings correspond to five loops of this natural rollercoaster.THE BEAK-ING CLOCKEvolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned out.So, in order to warn off rivals, or to woo a mate, different species tend to start at different times in the morning.The skylark begins while it’s still dark — one and a half hours before sunrise. Next, redstarts begin their chorus.          Evolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned outBlackbirds then perform exactly one hour before sunrise, with chiffchaffs following 30 minutes later.Then, as the sun appears on the horizon, all the birds join in the dawn chorus. From then on, if you want to determine the time without aid of a watch, you’ll need to turn your attention to flowers.ANT AND TREKHave you ever puzzled over why flowers that have grown for years in a certain area of your garden suddenly appear in another part the following spring? It may be because ants picked up the seeds to gorge on fleshy, oil-rich appendages (called elaiosomes) which are found on some seeds and then they drop them up to 90 feet away from the parent plant.Plants which make use of this free delivery service include wild strawberries, dog violets, wild garlic, dead-nettles and forget-me-nots.WATERING TIPSBritain averages 133 days of rain or snow a year, totalling 885 millimetres.Plants adapt to deal with these downpours in different ways. Watch, for example, how, when it rains, rhubarb uses its large, funnel-shaped leaves to catch the water and guide it down its stems to the roots. The same technique is used by dandelions.Water management in your gardens depends on the soil type. Sandy soils allow a lot of water to trickle into the deeper layers, meaning that the groundwater is well replenished, but plants can dry out quickly. On the other hand, loamy soils — a mixture of sand, silt and clay — retain moisture from which plants benefit even over long periods with low levels of rainfall.There is a simple trick for checking whether your soil is sufficiently moist: push aside the humus (the brownish black matter on top, usually just one to two centimetres deep) until you see the pure soil.Press a clump of this between your index finger and thumb. If it sticks together, it is moist enough. But if it crumbles as soon as you release your fingers, it is too dry.Of course, you can provide remedial action by watering — but don’t mollycoddle your plants by watering your garden every day. By over-watering, they get used to having moisture around their roots and spread them out close to the surface.The fact is that plants thrive when they have to make an effort to find water and therefore grow much deeper roots. By doing so, they can always meet at least part of their fluid requirements even when the topsoil has dried out. The best solution during dry periods is to drench plants thoroughly. This simulates natural precipitation and ensures the water reaches the plants’ lower roots.Since the plant then has no incentive to direct its roots upwards, this encourages resilience and allows you to go away for a fortnight without your entire garden drying out.CLUES IN THE CLOUDSThe presence of condensation trails of aeroplanes (called ‘contrails’) are an early sign of bad weather.If these don’t dissolve, it means humidity is on its way and the sky will soon cloud over. The movement of real clouds also gives clues.As a rule of thumb, the weather will always change when clouds are moving in a different direction to the direction of the wind at ground level.Tall, towering clouds on the horizon herald rain. And clouds puffed out at the top, or forming an anvil shape, mean a thunderstorm is on the way.INSECT INDICATORSThe behaviour of creatures in your garden will give you a good idea of the temperature. At 0c many cold-blooded insects have a form of anti-freeze in their circulation systems to stop them being affected by the cold. This means they are happy to fly around at temperatures just over zero degrees.For example, ladybirds and winter crane flies (also known as winter midges) produce the chemical compound glycerol, a substance once used in car anti-freeze, to stop themselves getting too cold.          When spring temperatures reach 5c, it is the trigger for toads and frogs to start spawning.Bees only leave the hive at temperatures above 12c. Also, you’ll never hear the chirping (technically called stridulating) of grasshoppers and crickets below 12c.Honey bees cluster together in hives in the winter, maintaining a core temperature of 25c.They manage to maintain this level with the energy provided from their stores of honey.TELL THE TIME, PETALDifferent plants open their flowers at different points in the day.Pumpkins and courgettes (both from the cucurbits family of plants) kick things off by opening their flowers at 5am. From 8am, marigolds spread out their golden petals and daisies follow at 9am.When the sun’s at its peak at noon, the bedding plant Mesembryanthemum opens its blossoms.Between 2pm and 3pm, after a morning’s work, dandelions start to close their heads, and by 3pm, gourd flowers have finished for the day.After doing the longest shift, poppies shut up shop at around 6pm.But it’s after sunset that certain flowers open, attracting flying pollinators — such as moths — which are on the wing for a sip of nectar at this late hour.Many plant species have adopted this late-opening strategy, including evening primrose.Others remain open all day but only start to emit their seductive aromas after dusk — common soapwort and the perennial phlox among them.If you like to sit outside on a warm summer evening, plant a few specimens of these night bloomers in your favourite spot.You’ll be well rewarded by the opportunity to observe some shy visitors, including many you may have never seen before.FEATHER FORECASTERSThe ancient saying, ‘when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry’ is not accurate. In fact, swallows fly higher than normal when the wind picks up before a storm.A much better guide to weather changes is the chaffinch (Britain’s seventh most common species of bird). It has an idiosyncratic way of warning us. In fine weather, males usually trill a melody that goes ‘chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo’.However, if rain is imminent, it sounds a monosyllabic ‘raaatch’.FLIGHT RISKSMoths orientate themselves by flying at a constant angle to the Moon.Unfortunately, they often confuse artificial street lights and domestic light-bulbs for the lunar glow.Sadly, they often crash into these man-made lights and are killed.Inevitably, predators have taken advantage. On warm summer nights, bats cleverly patrol street-lamps in the hope of easy pickings.If you want to help save insects from such a fate, close your blinds and curtains as soon as you switch on your lights after dark so as to reduce the artificial glare through your windows.The same applies to lights in your garden, which attract spiders and woodlice.SMELLING DANGERResearchers have recently discovered that plants talk to one another via ‘scent messages’.Trees, for example, warn each other about insect attacks by giving off a chemical distress signal. This is the cue for others of the same species to produce defensive chemicals that are then stored in their bark ready to give off themselves if necessary.Similarly, plants emit warning signals when under stress — for example when they are lacking food or water. Conversely, when happy with their location and have enough food, pine trees give off a sweet, aromatic fragrance.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                         In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia. But I no longer accept that everything which is going wrong in South of Italy, in Mezzogiorno, is explained by the fact that the EU or the European Commission would not do enough,\u0027 he said after leaving a meeting in Brussels.\u0027Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u0027He urged Italy not to \u0027play this game\u0027 of holding the EU responsible, adding \u0027Nations first, Europe second.\u0027 Political neophyte Conte skipped teaching a class at the University of Florence to return to Rome after he was summoned to meet Mattarella at the presidential palace on Thursday night.            In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Carlo Cottarelli (pictured) announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/13/4C86DA9E00000578-0-Mr_Duddridge_has_been_calling_for_Mr_Bercow_to_abide_by_his_pled-m-2_1527077147022.jpg","title":"Adrenaline junkies distance running new heights competing half marathon tightrope","story":"    So-called slackliners make their way between two tower blocks in Zurich, Switzerland.

As western companies, including Sony, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and BP’s Castrol, have pulled out of sponsoring the tournament after the Fifa bribery and corruption scandal, Chinese firms have secured an unprecedented presence at Russia 2018. When Russia kicks off against Saudi Arabia in the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on 14 June, fans will be treated to a seven-minute advert for Mengniu Group’s inner Mongolian milk and drinkable yoghurt. The commercial will be aired during each of the 64 games in the tournament. Spectators fancying an ice-cream will have to pick from unfamiliar names such as Mood for Green, Ice+ or Suibian SuiXinGuo, after Mengniu secured exclusive rights to sell sweet treats including yoghurt drinks in the stadiums. Other unfamiliar names to get to grips with during the month-long tournament include: Vivo, a mobile phone firm producing China’s version of the iPhone at a fraction of the price the TV and fridge maker Hisense the electric scooter company Yadea and Dalian Wanda, a conglomerate controlled by the multibillionaire Wang Jianlin. The dominating presence of Chinese brands comes despite the country’s national team failing to qualify for Russia 2014 or the previous World Cup in Brazil.Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, said: “As Fifa is now seen as a toxic brand that many western companies do not want to be associated with, China is seizing the opportunity.Chadwick said the lack of demand from western companies to sponsor the World Cup in Russia, and Qatar in 2022, has left Fifa “desperate for cash, and Chinese companies spotted the opportunity for a relatively cost-effective way to get their brands in front of billions of global eyeballs”. Wang, the fifth-richest person in China with a $23.4bn (£17.6bn) fortune, according to Bloomberg’s billionaires index, said: “Two or three years ago, Chinese and Asian companies probably wouldn’t even have had a chance to sponsor Fifa even if we wanted to. But because some western companies dropped out, we got the opportunity.”Wanda, which owns the British luxury yacht builder Sunseeker, the Hollywood studio that made Godzilla and The Hangover as well as a stake in Atlético Madrid, has signed up as a Fifa partner – the highest level of sponsorship – alongside Coca-Cola, Visa, Adidas and Russia’s Gazprom for the next four World Cups.“If more Chinese brother companies become Fifa sponsors like Wanda, we will join forces to advance the interests of China soccer,” Wang said. Chadwick said the Chinese companies’ Fifa sponsorship deals were encouraged by President Xi Jinping to help fuel his dream of turning China into a “world football superpower” by 2050. “China wants to host the the World Cup, China wants to win the World Cup, and I speculate they also want a Chinese president of Fifa,” Chadwick said. “Rescuing Fifa financially with these sponsorship deals will help the chances of achieving those dreams immeasurably.”After TV rights sales, sponsorship is Fifa’s biggest income stream and was worth $1.6bn for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The loss of sponsors and the struggle to sign deals after the bribery scandal dragged Fifa to a record $369m loss in 2016. Jon Tibbs, founder and chair of JTA, a sports reputation management company, said it was sensible of Chinese firms to use football for promotion. “As the traditional western brands get cold feet and face consumers’ pressure, it is inevitable that Fifa turns to new markets,” he said.“For Chinese brands seeking new markets it is relatively very easy and prestigious to partner with Fifa. It is widely believed that China will bid for the 2030 World Cup, obviously if there are a large number of Chinese sponsors helping to prop up Fifa that is a very good starting point.”Sam Burne James, news editor of PR Week, said Fifa was “certainly seen as toxic” by many British brands, and Boris Johnson’s comparison of the World Cup under Vladimir Putin to the 1936 Olympic Games under Hitler had not helped. “If you look at few tournaments back, most of the brands would be recognisable to western audiences, now several of them are unheard of – and that shift will continue,” he said. “Chinese companies get two things from sponsoring the World Cup. The first is access to western audiences that they will sooner or later be trying to win over, as their companies expand. The other is a cosmopolitan veneer to their brands, which they hope will resonate with their sizeable domestic markets.”Vivo, founded nine years ago, paid €400m (£350m) for a six-year deal that included Russia 2018, Qatar 2022 and the Confederations Cup. It has signed up the Brazilian footballer José Roberto Gama de Oliveira - better known as Bebeto – and Holland’s Ruud Gullit to front its World Cup campaign – and its advertising campaign video, launched this week, sums up the opportunity the Chinese corporate sponsors are trying to grab: “The world is watching,” Vivo said. “This is our moment.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c69076e997e030e8ae66de8509f7dedf7a062201/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec0ab39f8973271aba877333f49000fa 480w","title":"conservatives islamophobia muslim council britain","story":"The Muslim Council of Britain has given the party a long list of legitimate concerns. Now the ball is in Brandon Lewis’s courtThis week, the Muslim Council of Britain – of which I am assistant secretary general – wrote to the Conservative chair, Brandon Lewis, detailing the many incidents of unchecked Islamophobia within his party. The MCB chose its words carefully, explicitly refraining from calling the party inherently Islamophobic. But the letter did call for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia so that the Conservatives could acknowledge the problem and find ways to fix it.As chairman, Lewis is the person who could make a difference. But in recent weeks, he and the party’s deputy chair, James Cleverly, have played down Islamophobia among Conservatives despite the wealth of evidence to the contrary.Take Zac Goldsmith’s campaign for London mayor. The way devout Muslims were depicted in that campaign was described by Andrew Boff, the most senior Conservative in the London assembly, as “outrageous”. Yet, senior figures within the party appeared to take an active role in the strategy. Theresa May, home secretary at the time, declared Khan unsafe to run London because of an alleged history of defending extremists and David Cameron and the then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, falsely accused an imam associated with Khan of supporting Islamic State. The claim was later retracted (Fallon had to pay damages). After his mayoral defeat, Goldsmith remained in the party despite there being no apology, no acknowledgement of the racism of the campaign and despite the fact continued to state that Khan had links to extremism.One MP, Bob Blackman, shared an anti-Muslim tweet from the far-right activist Tommy Robinson in 2016, though he claims it was an “error”. He also hosted a hardline anti-Muslim Hindu nationalist in parliament. He was also a member of Islamophobic Facebook groups including Britain for the British. Just this week, he was revealed to have shared a tweet by the website ShankhNaad, which has been accused of publishing false stories designed to cause tensions between Hindus and Muslims.It’s not just MPs. Conservative candidates and councillors exhibit Islamophobia on a weekly basis. One shared a post that called Muslims “parasites”, another endorsed the idea that Muslims should be “repatriated” to keep Europe safe, and another was exposed as being a former “security adviser” to the British National party.This overwhelming evidence of Islamophobia is extremely serious and merits urgent action.Sayeeda Warsi, the first Muslim to serve in cabinet and the party’s former chair, believes there is a “simmering underbelly” of Islamophobia in the party. Lady Warsi raised her concerns informally and formally, including a letter to the prime minister last year, but on each occasion, she says the party “shrugged its shoulders” and did nothing.The decision by the MCB to issue a formal letter on this issue has not been reached lightly. The Conservative party has so far chosen to be defensive, rather than engage with the cases put forward.• Miqdaad Versi is assistant secretary general for the Muslim Council of Britain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d0d1d2e3c0e38130f9f81eefd0c842a63c5ea1c/574_247_2353_1412/master/2353.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=513198921c4d7e9b6b620cfcb11b918a","title":"yoko ono john lennon liverpool double fantasy","story":"She was labelled a witch and a band wrecker. Now, 38 years after the murder of her husband John Lennon, Yoko Ono has returned to his home town to tell their story“Your life is being conducted in front of the world, like a play,” Yoko Ono tweeted recently. “Know that it is, therefore, a play to people who watch it.” That Ono is on Twitter makes utter sense: her aphorisms were almost like tweets before the thing was invented. She has always been ahead of her time. People seem to have hated her in so many ways that I assume she must see herself as a character in a story in order just to live, just to continue being her own woman.She is here now in front of me, a tiny woman in her shades and her hat tending to the final details of her exhibition in Liverpool, Double Fantasy. I see apples on Perspex plinths, to replicate the apple that an apparently rude John Lennon took a bite of when he met her at the Indica gallery in London. Ono, who for so long was ageless, is now 85 and needs a bit of help. I am told she is feeling emotional. She doesn’t do jetlag, apparently. The next day she will visit the house Lennon grew up in and sit in his bedroom, feeling him close.“She took him away from us,” a man in a pub tells me. “But she has always come back to Liverpool. She has not forgotten us.” His friends agree. There is a grudging respect now for a woman who was once seen a wrecker of the Beatles, an evil foreigner who stole away and bewitched a jaded and stupefied Lennon.She was regarded as a manipulative, clingy, talentless fake who somehow enchanted the superstar Beatle. All the loathing that was poured onto Ono is now quite difficult to read: misogyny laced with out-and-out racism. The music press and the art world policed the boundaries of femininity then and now – and Ono did not fit. The poisonous Albert Goldman book, The Lives of John Lennon, ascribed every stereotype about oriental women to her. She was the evil dragon lady who played the mute geisha. Lennon was the weak, flawed man manipulated by this cunning, grasping creature. It was OK, in 1988, for Goldman to describe her as “simian-looking”, to speculate on intimacies he could not have possibly known about.No wonder Ono wanted to tell her tale of their relationship in the place of Lennon’s birth, though this is not a setting-the-record-straight show exactly. The exhibition is called Double Fantasy. Maybe their coupling was a fantasy, maybe all relationships are, but here that fantasy is set in the context of world events. A simple love story perhaps, but the context was the tectonic plates that were shifting in 1966: Vietnam and the civil-rights movement are the backdrop. Their art is their response.To see objects that belonged to the couple is strangely moving. Ono’s sunglasses positioned opposite Lennon’s wire NHS specs, the lenses mirroring each other. The loss registers. I had met Ono before at some post-gig meet and greet. I did not know what to say. Oh Yoko. She had been on stage screaming in the voice of an abused child. Sean Lennon, their son, was there so it seemed easier to chat to him. She did not seem one for small talk somehow. I wanted to tell her I had seen the Beatles as a tiny child, taken by my uncle and been terrified. It was the first gig I ever went to. I don’t think we had “health and safety” in those days and they just hit the girls off stage with brooms. It was just screaming and screaming.When Lennon was murdered, I was working in a restaurant in Miami and made huge tips that night because I was English and kept crying while serving diners. That’s a long time ago and the Beatles don’t seem much in fashion any more. Fashion of course is something Ono knows very well. She loves clothes. She is always in black and white and she knows what she is doing.In one film in the show, when Lennon is being interviewed by Michael Parkinson, he asks why the press are calling Ono ugly. Why is that acceptable? Lennon explains the public perception. “This Japanese witch has made him crazy and he’s gone bananas. But … all she did was take the bananas part of me out of the closet that, you know, has been inhibited by another part.”Often in interviews Ono sits smoking and silent. That became a familiar image, but now we know differently. Ono hung on to Lennon because he was so insecure he would not let her out of his sight for a second. Indeed, Double Fantasy helps to reconfigure their relationship in ways that may finally balance. Instead of her leeching off him, maybe he was leeching off her. Maybe it was mutual. She was an artist, involved in Fluxus. She knew all the luminaries such as John Cage and had exhibited internationally. Like Lennon, she was married with a child. Like him, war was in her background: Liverpool had been bombed, Ono had had to flee Tokyo. As a child, she said, she looked like a ghost because of food shortages. She also said she never pursued a guy, that it was never her style, and that she wanted an equal relationship. “You can’t love someone unless you are in an equal position with them,” she declared in 1971. Lennon came into the relationship a violent man who had hit his first wife and was often cruel. Ono confronted this. She talked too of bisexuality. In the same year, Lennon told the underground newspaper Red Mole that she was into liberation before he came along. “She had to fight her way through a man’s world – the art world is completely dominated by men.” He described her revolutionary zeal: “There was never any question we had to have a 5050 relationship or there was no relationship.”This attempt at a personal and artistic collaboration was much mocked. Attempting equality seemed to push them further into their own bubble. That and, of course, heroin. But what else was Lennon to do with the massive celebrity that was eating at him? While Kanye West uses his power to support Trump, his partner flogs appetite-suppressing lollipops. Lennon and Ono were after a somewhat bigger prize: world peace. A deconstruction of masculine power and fake action. They would attract the press to their cause by staying in bed.The bed-ins, indeed many of couple’s concepts, have been relentlessly pilloried as simplistic, as a bit Hallmark, a bit Zen, as somehow not real art because conceptual art was not in vogue as it is now. Ono’s Cut Piece from 1964 – invoking rituals around gender and identity, vulnerability and dissent, in which audience members could cut off her clothes – is pre-Abramović. Her film Rape, her use of nudity in performance, her interest in primal scream therapy, her insistence that everyone could be an artist, the idea that art was always to be made in process with the spectator and it is the interaction not the product that matters – Lennon imbibed all these things that now feel completely contemporary.Not everything she did with Lennon worked, that’s for sure. The boundary between art and life was blurred by celebrity and money. Yet so much of their relationship was seen through the prism of race and patriarchy. It was not that they had an open relationship or needed to rethink. It was that she arranged for Lennon to have an affair with her assistant May Pang. She is the arch manipulator.Alongside this, Ono is playing with the power of the male gaze and returning it, with nude pictures of her and Lennon that are not flattering but entirely human. She made a film of Lennon’s penis and called it Self-Portrait. This is the woman who we are always told has no sense of humour. In 1964, she too started thinking about the female gaze, screening a Hollywood movie with the instruction: “Do not look at Rock Hudson, look only at Doris Day.”It seems sometimes as if Lennon’s star has waned, while hers has waxed – with many artists and musicians acknowledging her influence. So it is quite something for her to go back to Liverpool to document all the collaborations she made with Lennon. She cannot escape being defined by him, but she now gives us the holy relics of their relationship and sets them in history. The famous ladder from the Indica gallery, his shirt, the glasses, the bedclothes, the funny surreal instructions: “Imagine the cloud dripping  Dig a hole in your garden to put it in.”She said she was saying: “Please accept me  I am mad.” But there is a steeliness in her madness, in her presence here. Lennon needed her and was desperate to come back to her and have a child. She challenged power and violence, rejecting the macho idea of fighting for peace. “I wonder why men can get serious at all,” she muses in her 1964 book Grapefruit. “They have this delicate long thing hanging outside their bodies, which goes up and down by its own will.” She was clearly not seeking approval.As I was leaving the gallery, I saw too that she is still an activist. She may be old but she is indomitable. The world still needs to be changed. An exhibit had to be altered as the figures required updating. It said: “Over 1,400,000 people have been killed by guns since John Lennon was shot and killed on Dec 8, 1980.” She needed that to be put right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1ad3c2a1f080684bed00f508ae332b5959183d/43_0_5671_3402/master/5671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ee8c57e3345b15d1351dea7dd9112a","title":"the joy of pints and pies how i learned to love uk holidays","story":"Travel writer Anna Hart on how she finally left her passport behind and learned to love holidaying at home in the UKFor most of my life, travel to me meant going as far as I could for as long as I could. I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston. It’s been satisfying to join up some of the dots and understand why post-industrial Birmingham became the birthplace of heavy metal music. And now, when I read a Daphne du Maurier novel like Rebecca or My Cousin Rachel, I can visualise the Cornish scenery she renders through words. I’ll never lose my lust for long-haul international travel, but learning to see the UK through the wide eyes of a visitor means I’ll never take home for granted again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023f29a85170eda53eb8ecd4ee1d932ab6ee3fc9/0_0_5651_3391/master/5651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597bff482d92a878015e406dd1722157","title":"quiz have you got the entrepreneur gene","story":"Dreaming of ditching the nine to five?

Now she wants to change the entire industry’s attitude towards women. ‘I know I’m on the right course,’ she saysThe day we meet, the sky is black and the rain comes fast and heavy. Rose McGowan had walked into the hotel bar looking slight, but as she sits in an armchair, her back to the window, streaks of lightning flash outside behind her head and she looks, instead, like some sort of avenging angel. “I\u0026nbspwanted to show people around the world that you can strike at the head of power and not just bite at the ankles,” she says. “Because they can shake you off when you bite at the\u0026nbspankles.”When allegations of sexual assault started to surface about the film producer Harvey Weinstein late last year – he has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex\u0026nbsp– McGowan added her voice, early and loudly. The former actor had collaborated with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times journalists who broke the story in October, passing on information about the $100,000 settlement he paid her in 1997 after an alleged assault. When Weinstein turned himself in last week, McGowan tweeted: “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.” This week, a\u0026nbspgrand jury indicted Weinstein on rape and criminal sex act charges, which he\u0026nbspdenies.“I\u0026nbspcried the other night, finally,” she says. “I\u0026nbspwas asked a\u0026nbsplot when he was arrested: ‘How does it feel?’ And I\u0026nbsphadn’t really had time to process how it felt. I\u0026nbspwent to Central Park – it was around midnight – and I\u0026nbspjust cried. I\u0026nbspcried for the girl I\u0026nbspwas, I\u0026nbspcried for her. But today I\u0026nbspsmile for\u0026nbspme.”The aftermath of the story breaking has been “extreme” says McGowan, although she says she had been living through a\u0026nbspstrange and nightmarish time long before the articles came out. She alleges that, when he heard about her tell-all memoir, Brave, Weinstein hired investigators, including former agents from the Mossad, to follow her and infiltrate her circle. It sounds like an outlandish claim, but a New Yorker story corroborates it. (A Weinstein spokesman told the magazine: “It is a\u0026nbspfiction to suggest that any iniduals were targeted or suppressed at any\u0026nbsptime.”)For McGowan, Weinstein’s fall has been a\u0026nbsplong time coming. In 2016, she alleged on Twitter that a “studio head” had raped her and she had been working on her memoir – in which she would write about the 1997 assault – for more than three years. The book was finished, and she was proofreading it and sorting out a\u0026nbspfew legal issues,\u0026nbspwhen the New York Times and New Yorker stories about Weinstein dropped. Would she have published her book without them? “I\u0026nbspdidn’t want to,” she says. “I\u0026nbspwould have published it, but my goal was also to bring down a\u0026nbsppower structure.” She smiles. Without the press reports and other women – including Gwyneth Paltrow, Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino and Salma Hayek – coming forward, “I\u0026nbspthink it would have largely fallen on deaf\u0026nbspears”.One night, four years ago, McGowan was at home during a\u0026nbsppower cut. She lay in the dark, with time to think and no distractions, and decided she hated acting. “Not the act of acting I\u0026nbspjust hated every part of the system I\u0026nbspwas in,” she says. “It was like an alarm bell going off in my head: ‘Wake up: this life is not right for you.’ And it was like a\u0026nbspthunderbolt.” McGowan started behaving with all the freedom of someone who felt they had nothing to lose. In 2015, she tweeted a\u0026nbspcasting note that came with a\u0026nbspscript for an Adam Sandler film that asked actresses to show cleavage: “push-up bras encouraged”. She describes it as “the opening salvo”. Her agent fired\u0026nbspher.Then she started giving interviews, talking about the sexism and sexual abuse in the industry. She shaved off her long, dark hair which, she says, had been part of what Hollywood expected of her. “I\u0026nbspwent up against them. It was just not done, it’s supposed to be sacrosanct,” she says, laughing. She says that someone recently asked if she was persona non grata in Hollywood. “Well, they’re personae non gratae with me. Don’t I\u0026nbspget a\u0026nbspsay?”She has not behaved the way Hollywood expected her to, but she has also had a\u0026nbsptricky relationship with the #MeToo movement. It probably has much to do with how unconventional she is, as well as a sense that she just does not seem to care what people think about her, but there have been eccentric appearances on TV talkshows and a\u0026nbsppublic row with a\u0026nbsptransgender person at one of her book signings. When attenders at the Golden Globes wore black in solidarity, McGowan responded on Twitter, saying that “not one of those fancy people wearing black to honor our rapes would have lifted a\u0026nbspfinger” had she and others not spoken up. She has attacked prominent iniduals involved in the movement, such as Alyssa Milano, and been accused of self-promotion and glorification. How does she cope with that accusation? “That’s only stupid\u0026nbsp… people saying that. So I\u0026nbspdon’t have to cope with them at all. Why would I\u0026nbspwant this publicity? It’s asinine. If you follow me out on the street, people don’t say\u0026nbspthat.”Hers is an extraordinary life. Her father, whom she believes had bipolar disorder, came from a\u0026nbspchaotic family and, while using heroin in California, joined the religious cult Children of God and came off drugs. Her mother had run away at 15 and met McGowan’s father at 18. By 19, writes McGowan, “she was pregnant and in a\u0026nbspcult”.The next few years were horrific (my word she describes it as “tough”), disrupted by the violent and abusive men her mother took up with, an enforced spell in rehab (caused, she says, by her stepfather finding out she had taken a\u0026nbspsingle acid tab) and a\u0026nbspperiod being a\u0026nbsphomeless runaway. Eventually, she found herself back with her mentally ill father, who wouldn’t give her cutlery or a\u0026nbspproper bed because he said she wasn’t worth it. She would fantasise about murdering him, she writes in her\u0026nbspbook.It was when he told her she had to pay several hundred dollars a\u0026nbspmonth in rent that she answered an advert asking for movie extras. At 15, she appeared in a\u0026nbspfilm Class of 1999 one of the men involved in the film called her up to his hotel room and allegedly sexually assaulted her. And so began McGowan’s experience of Hollywood. She soon realised, she says, “that town is really built on sickness. Very early on I\u0026nbsplooked at the power structure, the figureheads, the silence, the closed ranks. Nobody tells. It operates like a\u0026nbspcult.” As a\u0026nbspwoman, she says she felt belittled and objectified, treated as inferior to her male colleagues: “I\u0026nbspalways knew that I\u0026nbspwas No 2 on the call sheet instead of No 1, even though I\u0026nbspwas the lead. Or nobody would listen to anything I\u0026nbspwould say, even if it could save a\u0026nbsplot of money or time on set. I\u0026nbsphad a\u0026nbspline on the inside of my mouth that I\u0026nbspwould chew, just bite down. Just suck it up, push the rage\u0026nbspdown.”It was 1997, during the Sundance film festival, when Weinstein summoned McGowan to his hotel suite. She had starred in the Miramax film Going All the Way and was shooting another, Phantoms. Her manager said she should go and meet him. Thinking the meeting was finished, McGowan writes, she walked down the hallway with Weinstein. Then, she alleges, he pushed her into a\u0026nbspsmall, dark Jacuzzi room, took off her clothes and sexually assaulted her. She says she faked an orgasm to get him to\u0026nbspstop.The complicity and cover-up followed. McGowan says her manager at the time, Jill Messick, told her it “would help her career in the long run”. Weinstein, trying to defend himself, released an email from Messick in January this year in which she said her memory of what happened in 1997 was that it had been consensual, if something McGowan later regretted. Messick had become publicly embroiled in the story and, in February, she killed herself. A\u0026nbspstatement from her family partly blamed Weinstein and McGowan, claiming that Messick, who had mental health problems, had been devastated by “one person’s attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey’s desperate attempt to vindicate himself”. McGowan responded with an Instagram post wishing Messick’s family “solace”, adding: “The bad man did this to us\u0026nbspboth.”After the alleged assault, McGowan says she approached a\u0026nbsplawyer who told her she would never win a\u0026nbspcourt case against him because “you are an actress. You’ve done a\u0026nbspsex scene.” Instead, she was given $100,000 by Weinstein\u0026nbsp– she says the money felt dirty and she gave most of it\u0026nbspaway.She carried on working, though. I\u0026nbspwonder why. It would have been appalling to have been hounded out of a\u0026nbspjob she loved, but, as she notes, she didn’t love it. She says she was famous by then, appearing in the TV series Charmed, and wouldn’t have been able to get another job outside the entertainment industry. I’m not sure this follows. More compelling is the reason she gives in her book: that she was terrified of being homeless again. “Safety isn’t a\u0026nbspfeeling I have known,” she says, talking about her childhood. “Not unless it’s self-provided.” What kept her going? She smiles. “I\u0026nbspalways knew I\u0026nbspwas right and I have always been one for\u0026nbspjustice.”For five years she appeared in the TV series, Charmed. She didn’t particularly enjoy it, she says, but she says it was a “strategic” move. “It was big all over the world. I joined in the fourth season and it was already a hit. When and if I managed to break this news, it would be newsworthy all over the world because I’d kept my celebrity level just enough to be newsworthy.”Brave by Rose McGowan is published by HarperCollins at £20.

He had subsequently felt obliged to reaffirm his commitment to the entire squad and, having trained impressively in the period since, is still expected to start Saturday’s friendly against Nigeria at Wembley.Confirmation of last month’s misdemeanour comes after a week in which Sterling has been subjected to frenzied media scrutiny over a new gun tattoo on his leg. Southgate has spoken to the 23-year-old about that and reaffirmed publicly that Sterling “has our support”, though he will have taken a dimmer view of Sterling’s tardy arrival, however unintentional, given the implied lack of respect to the group.While the manager had granted his entire squad a week’s break at the end of their respective club seasons, Sterling had been given an extra day off for family reasons, meaning he was expected to report 24 hours after the main bulk of his colleagues on the evening of Tuesday, 22 May. The City forward duly travelled to Ibiza and, having returning briefly to the United Kingdom, went to Jamaica on a family holiday.Yet a mistake over flight times saw him having to return via Miami and, having telephoned Southgate to explain he had made an error, he did not meet up with the national squad until Wednesday morning. He ended up training that day in the gym. “He was given off until the Tuesday night and he arrived on the Wednesday morning, so he was late,” said Southgate. “That was dealt with. There was a mix-up on flights and a connection. I had a discussion with the player and then he, in fairness, wanted to apologise to the group.“He explained his commitment to the team. We’ve dealt with it internally. Everybody moved on. I have to say, he’s trained brilliantly all week. He’s so keen for this tournament to be a success for him and the team. There was nothing intentional in his lateness. The reason I ‘dealt with it’ was because we’d agreed he could have some extra time, and he was late after the extra time. That was the only issue. It was not an intentional situation. If someone doesn’t want to be here and wants to be late, that’s different, but I know how he was about it, so his commitment and focus were clear to me.”Southgate has made clear to Sterling he will not tolerate a repeat in the weeks ahead as England’s preparations for Russia gather pace, starting with the friendly against Nigeria. “Managers want an easy life, really,” he said. “We know the world we live in. Nothing stays private. So if those situations happen, they are going to be out there. There is a requirement to answer questions on them, and the possibility they become a bigger issue than they might. That’s part of the long discussion we had when we went for a walk.“Raheem is the type of player who can make a difference. Look at the impact he has had at Manchester City this year – it was the same for us in our friendlies in March. There is a bigger expectation, a bigger focus on him. But if you want to be a top player, you have to be able to handle that. I’m looking forward to seeing him play on Saturday and he’s looking forward to the games.”Phil Foden and Jadon Sancho were disciplined and dropped from the starting lineup for an England Under 19s fixture against Latvia in March after turning up late for a training session.Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold are not under consideration for the game against Nigeria having yet to link up with the squad after playing in last weekend’s Champions League final. Phil Jones is also out of contention with his partner due to give birth, while the fitness of both Harry Maguire and Danny Rose will be monitored. Sterling should operate just behind the newly appointed captain, Harry Kane, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek is expected to gain his third cap in central midfield."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ac13df291d48f78962c1da7167d5e7d4eaed27/0_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86204abf9335da9c790619e7c33c13ed","title":"turmoil chelsea owner annoyed manager limbo players unsettled","story":"Roman Abramovich’s decision to scrap the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge could bring matters to a head at troubled clubChelsea’s owner of 15 years, Roman Abramovich, pulled the plug on the £1bn redevelopment of Stamford Bridge on Thursday having grown infuriated by the Home Office delaying the renewal of his investor’s visa, a move born of heightened tensions between Britain and Russia. The oligarch’s decision has been interpreted by some as the first public indication his enthusiasm for the club is on the wane. On the football side, doubts surround the future of Antonio Conte and the identity of his potential successor, while the team’s star player, Eden Hazard, awaits evidence the club shares his ambitions to challenge for the Premier League title. We address the key questions at a club in flux.The revamp of Stamford Bridge was Abramovich’s pet project. Increasing the capacity from 41,631 to 60,000, with its extra hospitality and commercial opportunities, would have driven Chelsea further along the road to long-term sustainability, allowing them to compete more easily with elite rivals within the restrictions of financial fair play regulations, while also providing an eye-catching legacy of the Russian’s tenure. The stadium is not even in the 60 biggest grounds in Europe. Yet Abramovich is understandably reluctant to invest heavily in a major project in the capital of a country where he has been denied a visa. The only problem is that, by putting the build on hold – and shelving the estimated £22m in community benefits associated with the plans – the owner has effectively opted against addressing the issue of long-term sustainability, and cast some doubt on his plans for the club.Apparently not, though he clearly has his issues with the British government. Chelsea insist Abramovich is as committed as ever to a club in which he has invested £1.17bn and into which he continues to pour money – £34m in the 2016-17 accounts – and that opting out of the stadium development does not have implications on the football side, though that will be tested in the weeks to come. The Russian is moving to Tel Aviv having gained Israeli citizenship and has reportedly withdrawn his British visa application now he will be able to visit for up to six months at a time (although not work in the UK). Being based abroad is hardly an issue. The Premier League’s elite clubs are all overseen by overseas owners. Yet if Abramovich makes his home in Israel, the stadium plans are shelved forever and Chelsea’s yearning for sustainability is never really addressed, what is his motivation for owning the club? Maybe he will still benefit from the profile but the possibility of a sale would surely be mooted. “If the visa issue isn’t resolved I think anything could happen,” said the club’s former chief executive Trevor Birch. “There’s obviously a great deal of concern around at the moment. But it’s eminently sellable as a club. With TV rights increasing, if Manchester United are valued at over £3bn then Chelsea would be valued at around £1.5bn, and very attractive.”Matters on the pitch feel almost trivial in contrast with the ownership issue but there is a desperate need to address the immediate uncertainty. Players emerged from their victory in the FA Cup final suggesting enough was enough, and some clarity is required over Conte’s future. He has secured major honours in each of his two seasons at Chelsea and is under contract for a further year, yet expects to be sacked having grated with the hierarchy for more than a season. He is none the wiser, however, as to whether he will be in situ when the players report back in July. Talks have taken place with Maurizio Sarri, who employed an England-based representative to smooth a move to the Premier League, but Chelsea are reluctant to pay for his release from his Napoli contract given the Italian club have already appointed his successor in Carlo Ancelotti. Some within the club have pointed to unsavoury incidents in Sarri’s past, and to the reality he is yet to claim a major honour. Laurent Blanc’s candidature has been discussed, though the Frenchman would feel like a stop-gap. Luis Enrique and Leonardo Jardim were the others in the frame, and Avram Grant’s name has cropped up, which would dismay the support. But there is no obvious consistency to the strategy in terms of the style of football any of the candidates might play. The process seems muddled and forced on the club by a fallout with Conte.The director Marina Granovskaia has been overseeing recruitment since Michael Emenalo’s resignation last November – no replacement has been made, though talks have taken place with prospective candidates – but is apparently in Russia and will return to work next week. Chelsea can pursue players who fit their criteria and run their favourites past the manager at a later date, and the wheels are in motion in terms of incoming transfers. Yet time is ticking down to that early deadline in August and Hazard will want evidence the “good players” he had stipulated must be purchased are being secured. Failure could have implications on whether Chelsea can tie their top performer down to a new contract. It is hardly helpful, either, that Thibaut Courtois will not address his contractual situation until after the World Cup as he enters the final 12 months of his deal. Chelsea have played the market shrewdly over recent years, raising funds through sales from first team and loan players alike. Having to replace their goalkeeper would be another unwelcome headache."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e1753e50aa127ab9883c66d697b5886f988cefd/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c9a525b01fc06d82b62ec5cbbb647a","title":"best way avoid regrets oliver burkeman","story":"Unpursued dreams have a tendency to stay in the background, gnawing at you, until suddenly it’s too lateHow should you spend your life if you don’t want to end up filled with regret? The standard modern answer to this ancient question, often based on research by the psychologist Thomas Gilovich, is that we regret inaction more than action: not things we do, but things we fail to do. I’ve long been sceptical, though. Can’t you simply rephrase any decision so it fits in either box? Leaving your relationship to embark on a round-the-world adventure might be a bold case of “doing something”, or it might mean shirking the hard but rewarding task of building a lifelong partnership. Having children clearly seems like an action – unless you’re doing it solely to comply with social expectations, in which case it’s surely a matter of failing to forge your own path. And so on. Clearly, when it comes to avoiding regret, we’ll need a better rule of thumb than just “do stuff”.Gilovich and Davidai are appropriately reticent about deriving life advice from their research, but I’m not: these findings are a powerful argument for figuring out what you truly want from life and giving it a shot, even at the risk of others’ negative judgments. Of course, the challenge is figuring out what that is. “Do what you want” risks becoming a call to impulsiveness and hedonism (and plenty of regrets, of both the ideal-self and ought-self varieties). That’s why I like the trick, with its roots in the work of Carl Jung, of flipping the question and asking not what you want from life, but what life wants from you. Looking beyond your immediate whims and desires, what’s trying to come into being through you?I’m not sure it matters whether or not we each really have, as Jung believed, a soul with its own agenda, distinct from that of the ego, struggling to make itself heard. When faced with a big life choice, just asking the question that way can be enough to cut through the noise, to the quiet place where you already know what to do. Do that thing you’re unlikely to regret it.Read this: contrary to stereotype, philosophers these days tend to avoid pondering the meaning of life. But in his 2015 book A Significant Life, Todd May bucks the trend. Living meaningfully, he argues, is less a matter of what you do than how you do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d9aebb9859d890ef9a4674af71459ff9caef0ea/0_253_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a149a54ebb1bdacfa639fbb86edf3b","title":"craft cider recommendations fiona beckett","story":"Cider sales are on the up as craft brewers scent a boom.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598629a2778570e49024fed98bb0e0d8c9763f96/0_14_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9413ef305432f518c7b1d55ea6fc18b","title":"credit card spending terms conditions rbs natwest","story":"Get your credit card finances in order or we’ll pull the plug on your plastic!That is the warning to millions of credit card holders from the Royal Bank of ScotlandNatWest group, who are being sent new terms and conditions giving the company the right to “freeze spending” or withdraw it altogether.It says the changes are designed to help customers avoid long-term credit card debt. But one  Money reader tells us that, in her opinion, the leaflets could “cause massive stress” to some.So why is the bank clamping down – and is it a good or bad thing?It says the move is in line with industry-wide new rules introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) designed to help people in “persistent debt”.That means RBS is unlikely to be alone in sending out such warnings.The new terms and conditions, state that if a customer pays more in interest and charges than other amounts owed (ie, purchases, balance transfers, advances etc) over two 18-month periods in a row, “we may freeze spending on your card account”. It says this will be done “to help you focus on starting to reduce your outstanding debt”.It adds that a customer will always be alerted before this happens, and an account would only be frozen or withdrawn “if you’re unable or unwilling to reduce the amount you owe”. These changes took effect from 21 May.RBSNatWest tells us: “We want to help customers pay off their debts” and the changes “will help us to be able to do that”.Meanwhile, one credit card industry expert told Money that the aim of this sort of measure was about “protecting the customer ... so people can’t rack up more debt if they are not managing to pay off the debt they already have”.Some card holders may take the view that they are managing their finances perfectly well and do not need protecting from themselves, particularly if that protection is going to take the form of the card company threatening to pull the plug on their plastic, potentially leaving them high and dry at the supermarket checkout or on holiday.RBS says the changes reflect the new FCA rules, introduced on 1 March this year but which do not fully take effect until 1 September. They will force credit card providers to take a series of steps to help customers who have got into a long-term habit of only making the minimum payment each month – something that can often mask underlying financial difficulties.The regulator says action is needed because more than 3 million UK credit card holders are in persistent debt, typically handing over about £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 they repay.It comes amid this week’s clampdown on high-cost credit by the FCA, following an 18-month review into bank overdrafts, doorstep loans, catalogue credit and rent-to-own borrowing. It proposed a price cap in the rent-to-own sector, but stepped back from ordering price caps on overdrafts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a5e158927f04afe0da00f4f7f0311cfd743dfc/57_376_2211_1327/master/2211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78a34ab3ff2070f057d11dfca6a381ad","title":"roadmap to avoid brexit to be sent to mps and peers","story":"George Soros-backed Best for Britain pushes for second referendum on Theresa May’s deal with EU MPs and peers will be sent a roadmap next week detailing how they could stop Brexit by the George Soros-backed Best for Britain group, which has amassed £2.3m in donations to spend on a nationwide lobbying effort to persuade parliament to change its mind.The group will publish a timetable as part of its “campaign manifesto” at a launch event on 8 June saying that MPs need to introduce amendments calling for a second referendum on the final deal secured by Theresa May in which remaining in the European Union is an option on the ballot paper.Best for Britain says it is theoretically possible for a referendum to be held within 17 working days of parliament legislating for one, meaning it could be held in December. But the pressure group says the EU would allow the UK to have a second referendum as late as February or March.Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said a second referendum was necessary to ultimately settle the question of whether the UK should leave the EU: “We think people should have a chance to compare the deal we can get to the one we already have. What’s clear is we can’t have ‘a best of all worlds’ illusory Brexit as the debate about the Irish border shows.”To have any chance of success, Best for Britain would have to win over Labour’s front bench, plus more than 10 Tory rebels and shore up the support of sceptical backbench Labour MPs in constituencies that voted for leave in the 2016 referendum.The pressure group is stepping up its efforts to lobby 50 MPs by trying to generate pressure on them in their constituencies. It intends to take out advertisements in regional and local papers, starting on Saturday in the Scotsman, and buy up billboards in the target constituencies “as near to MPs’ offices as possible”. Campaign adverts, which have already appeared in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool as well as in some national newspapers, are headlined “When will we know what we voted for?” and add: “We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal”.Best for Britain said it would spend £500,000 of its £2.3m in donations on the newspaper and outdoor advertising campaign. The largest donor has been Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which has provided £800,000. He will not be attending next week’s launch event, but the 87-year-old financier and philanthropist gave a speech in Paris on Tuesday in which he trailed the launch, saying that Brexit was “an immensely damaging process”. He added: “Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better, however, if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.”Labour MPs in targeted leave-supporting areas include Caroline Flint, the Don Valley MP. She supported remain in 2016 but wrote last month that the UK should respect the referendum result and that parliament should stop “game playing” and reject proposals for a second national vote. Others in the campaign group’s focus include Ian Austin in Dudley North and the newly elected Gareth Snell in Stoke-on-Trent Central.Conservative MPs being targeted include John Stevenson, who holds the seat of Carlisle with a majority of 2,599 from Labour. Best for Britain says that future investment by multinational tyre maker Pirelli at a plant in the city remains at risk, unless the UK can at least remain part of a customs union with the EU.The pressure group believes the majority of the British public are turned off by the Brexit debate and will only seriously re-engage once the prime minister has concluded her orce negotiations with the EU. It is trying to train local organisers to organise street stalls or petitions with a target of having 20,000 conversations with members of the public in the 50 target seats.The involvement of Soros in the campaign has been attacked by rightwing newspapers, with the Daily Mail describing the Hungarian-American as a “foreign billionaire” engaged in a “plot to subvert Brexit”. Best for Britain uses that coverage as part of its fundraising campaigns, encouraging people to donate and “help us take on the Daily Mail” on a gofundme page that has raised £56,000 in the past week.Todd said: “The will of the people can be subverted by the will of the people in a second referendum. People can take a new decision based on new information.”The campaign group is not covered by Electoral Commission regulations, which ban foreign donors, because there is no pending national vote. However, a spokesman said the group did not take money from overseas and that Soros’s donations come via the Open Society Foundation’s UK branch, which is a company registered in England and Wales, which would mean they were permissible under election law.The campaign group hopes that several dozen MPs will attend the launch event, although does not intend to use any of its existing supporters as principal speakers. Labour MPs such as David Lammy and Jo Stevens have acted as spokespeople before, as well as Green party MP Caroline Lucas and Conservative Dominic Grieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6846c7f4436ac7cd6aeaac2e819bc1326814e0/0_29_4502_2701/master/4502.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df32fefb2ce731817817ced6eb7c05b","title":"junk food deals and adverts face fresh restrictions","story":"Clampdown on cartoon characters and celebrities promoting unhealthy food being consideredTwo-for-one junk food deals and the sale of sweets and chocolates around supermarket checkouts will reportedly be banned under a new government campaign against child obesity.A 9pm television watershed like the one imposed on sex and violence will be introduced from 2020 by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for foods high in sugar and salt, according to the .It said ministers were considering barring the use of cartoon characters and celebrities in promoting junk food would consult on making it illegal to sell energy drinks to under-16s and consider outlawing unlimited refills of sugary soft drinks in restaurants. Consultations on restricting and banning certain sales would be launched before the end of 2018.The newspaper quoted the report as saying: “Where food is placed in shops and how it is promoted can influence the way we shop and it is more common for HFSS (high in fat sugar and salt) products to be placed in the most prominent places in store as well as sold on promotion, eg with ‘buy one get one free’ offers.”The report comes the day after research was released showing that about half of television food and drink adverts seen by children were for HFSS products or fast food restaurants.On Wednesday, MPs on the health and social care select committee said cartoon characters should be banned from promoting junk food in order to help reduce childhood obesity rates. Such a ban would affect characters such as Tony the Tiger and the Milky Bar Kid and cartoon characters from blockbuster films.A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: “We’ve always said that our 2016 plan was the start of the conversation, not the final word on obesity. We are in the process of working up an updated plan and will be in a position to say more shortly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2bdbef1bdc8cc28ef143c732b8cf7a3093a7120/38_167_3370_2023/master/3370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a6f91466bb1fad5bcdb8e74f42a28f7","title":"kyle edmund fabio fognini french open","story":"Fabio Fognini is as close as tennis has to a wild-eyed, trash-talking boxer. Kyle Edmund would not look out of place checking your books in a library. Which only shows how appearances can deceive, as will surely be seen when the Italian and the Yorkshireman go at it for the first time in the third round of the French Open on Saturday.There is a steeliness about Edmund’s game that was missing last year, when he lost too many close matches to good players – most notably Kevin Anderson here at the same stage of the tournament, when he squandered a 2-1 advantage. First evidence that he had addressed the issue arrived in the rematch at the Australian Open. He overhauled a 2-1 deficit against the 2017 US Open finalist and was a break down in the fifth before grinding out the biggest win of his career to that point, leading on to his first appearance in a major semi-final.Edmund, 23, has no history with Fognini, who turned 31 last week, but, as he said after beating Marton Fucsovics in the second round: “The tour is aware of all players and what their attitudes are like.”It is likely the volume will be turned up on Saturday. If people thought marriage to the 2015 US Open champion, Flavia Pennetta, and fatherhood had calmed Fognini’s fire, he disabused them of the notion when he was thrown out of that tournament in September for hurling “extremely derogatory and misogynistic language” at a female umpire. The source of his ire was his compatriot, Stefano Travaglia, a qualifier who bageled him in the last set of their first-round match. Fognini still has a suspension hanging over him for that one.But nobody looks away. It is his tennis as much as his temperament that makes him a star, as Edmund is aware. “He’s a really good player,” he said. “He has his own style. He finds the areas on the court which are very good on clay.”Edmund’s first glimpse of Fognini was on TV, having left the Great Britain camp before their Davis Cup match against Italy in Naples four years ago, when Andy Murray, struck by flu and hampered by a dangerous court, could not unlock his mysteries.“There was the crowd, very passionate. That was a test, like playing a South American in South America. It doesn’t get much tougher in terms of atmosphere. It’s going to be a big test for me – playing a good clay-courter at the French Open, the clay grand slam. It’s where you want to be.”“But he is a player who is more difficult for me to beat on hard court than clay. He has a good forehand and serve. Before he wasn’t moving so well but now he is much better from a physical point of view.“I don’t see myself as underdog. It’s at least 50-50 chances for me. I’m coming out of six sets won in a row and I’ve lost just 14 games.”Someone who has watched Edmund close-up for years is his Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, who said: “You’ve seen him grow in confidence. Because he is not an extrovert, it was going to take him a little bit more time. His ranking and his results are what give him that sense of: ‘Yeah, I’m here because of my tennis.’“The good thing about him now, unusually for a British player – although Tim Henman got to a semi and Andy is obviously a very good clay-court player – Kyle is really suited to clay. It’s going to be a really good match. You have the flair and unpredictability of Fognini and the power game of Kyle.”Others have an equally high opinion of Edmund. John McEnroe said this week: “He’s got a great shot to get into the top 10 – in the next year, maximum, maybe less.” Pat Cash thinks so too. Edmund blushes and responds: “For someone to say that is great. Top 10 in waiting, OK – but it doesn’t just come. You have to earn it. I have to make it happen. I believe I can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a523e5547014da3685865a37a00d61fccaab63/109_108_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=831563890d87f16883dda350848b86f2","title":"michael dunlop interview tt race isle of man","story":"The world’s best road racer has won 15 races on the deadly TT roads and remains determined to do it his way“I’m the one putting my life on the line so it has to happen the way I want it to happen,” Michael Dunlop says bluntly on the Isle of Man while preparing for this year’s thrilling yet dangerous series of TT road races. Dunlop lays down the law in regard to this rare interview and all other personal interaction because from Saturday, and during six days of deadly racing, he will reach speeds in excess of 200mph as he pushes his motorbike to the limit on ordinary roads and mountain passes that have taken the lives of 256 riders over the years.Dunlop is one of the most intriguing yet prickliest men in sport. He has won 15 TT races and will surely go on to break the record held by his uncle Joey, the greatest road racer in history, who won 26 times on the Isle of Man before being killed on his bike in 2000. Dunlop also lost his father, Robert, Joey’s brother, at the North West 200 in their native Northern Ireland in 2008. Since we did this interview, Dan Kneen, who rode alongside Dunlop for Tyco BMW, died on Wednesday evening in practice for the TT.Stressing that he is “as fired up as I’ve ever been”, the 29-year-old does not dismiss a question as to whether he may shatter another TT record by winning six races at this year’s meeting. “Anything is possible,” he says. “But I’ll have to ride my bike as hard as I can. If that’s good enough to win, then great. If it’s not, that’s the way life is. These are long races and a lot goes on. We’ll take each one as it comes and see where we end up.”I have learned that with Dunlop it is wise to approach each encounter with few expectations that his brusque manner will soften and open a few chinks in the wall he has built around himself. We met for the first time last month, in the Triangle, as the North West 200 course is known, linking Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush.Ten years and one day had passed since his dad died on those very roads and Dunlop said a wary hello. It had been made clear he was not giving any interviews and I did not press him. Instead we spoke briefly about his 2017 book, Road Racer, which provides a compelling account of his dad’s death.On 15 May 2008 Robert and his two sons, William and Michael, were practising at the North West when the red flags came out. Eventually Michael saw “a man lying next to what’s left of his bike. That’s when it hits me. The man lying next to the broken bike is my dad”.Two days later, and defying the race stewards who declared that neither he nor his brother were fit to race, Michael got back on his bike. He wanted to honour his father by racing. The stewards were made to back down by a 19-year-old.Now, on the Isle of Man, Dunlop remembers how he only felt peace when snapping down his visor. Above the roaring engines, a sound that defined his father’s life, Dunlop heard silence. He looks at me for the first time since our interview began 15 minutes earlier: “Once you’re on the bike you’ve got freedom. It’s only you. Off the bike lots of people are picking and poking at you. I’m free on the bike.”In 2008 the teenage Dunlop raced wheel-to-wheel against Christian Elkin and the great John McGuinness. It was a dramatic race with, as Dunlop suggests in his book, “no love given, no love lost … I’m going so fast I don’t know if I can stop”.Dunlop won and the crowd erupted – in memory of Robert and in amazement at the grit of his son. For Dunlop: “My head’s full of tears. I’ve won the race but I can’t find any happiness in it. Tomorrow, I bury my father.”He has done so much since then. When Dunlop won the Senior TT last year he moved up to fourth among the all-time winners while strengthening his reputation as the world’s best road racer and the sport’s most difficult man. He loathes interviews and the only person able to persuade him to talk to me is Paul Phillips, who runs the TT, the race meeting that means most to Dunlop.“People say you need newspapers to create sponsorship. But the newspapers only want to speak to you when you’re winning. I don’t do much press now because I don’t like the bullshit.”Dunlop’s stark honesty is bracing. I hope I am not “pushing and poking” him too hard? He shrugs. “Everybody does – in one way or the other.”He only really begins to engage when I mention the 2015 TT. Two days before he was due to race his Yamaha he swapped it for a BMW. It is as bizarre as Lewis Hamilton stepping away from his Mercedes before a race and climbing inside a Ferrari. Surely this caused huge flak? “I don’t believe in flak. I don’t do flak. I do my own thing and if people don’t like it that’s their problem. I’m not a monkey at a circus. I’m not here to entertain anyone. I’m just here to win.”It still seems incredible he could hop on to a rival bike despite contracts and lawyers. “There’s a real story there,” he concedes. “But we’ll save that for another book. It’s not about who wears the right T-shirt or who shocked who. It’s about winning.”He is on a variety of bikes at this year’s TT, refusing to be tied to one manufacturer while running his own team, Michael Dunlop Racing. Apart from showing his voracious ambition it underlines Dunlop’s intelligence, despite his limited education, in securing the best bikes. “It’s not about the best bikes,” he insists. “All the manufacturers’ bikes are pretty equal. It’s about finding the best people I can do business with.”Dunlop acknowledges the gravity of road racing in his book: “Death is responsible for the man I am today – my dad going, my winning that race the day before his funeral, continuing the Dunlop ‘dynasty’ … I’d give it all up tomorrow to have him back just for a day.”He winces. “It was a stupid thing to say because anybody who lost their father would feel that. It’s the same for any normal human being.”His uncle Joey is feted justifiably but Dunlop believes his father was often as good on the bike and sometimes even better. “Oh yeah. He obviously had a shorter career but he was real good. He had two life-changing injuries so he had to keep motivating himself to get better. He was such a strong person and one of the toughest men who ever rode.”Robert Dunlop crashed so badly during practice for the TT in May 1994 that he spent six months in hospital and was bed-ridden for a year. His son, however, says: “I don’t take fear into consideration. Fear stays with you for ever. So I don’t do fear. Yeah, I’ve been scared on a bike but you don’t dwell on it. The important thing is to keep pushing.”When last did he feel scared on his bike? “Not so long ago … but long enough not to remember it.”His closest rival, Ian Hutchinson, one ahead of Dunlop on the all-time list and winner of a record five TT victories in a week, suffered another horrendous crash in the Senior race last year. Hutchinson could not walk for 11 months but he returned to racing two weeks ago at the North West. He shuffled over on a stick and gave me a gripping interview.Does Dunlop admire Hutchinson’s courage in making it to the TT? “Everyone who races motorbikes does their own thing. I don’t look out for anyone else. They don’t look out for me.”Does he really dislike Hutchinson? “That’s not the point. I just race motorbikes.”Dunlop is more relaxed when he tells me about the veterinary practice he part-owns in Dublin. “The lady that runs it is fantastic. I try to go as often as I can but I let her get on with it. She doesn’t need me asking stupid questions. For me it wasn’t just a business decision. It was also wanting to do something different.”“It’s not because I’m a wanker. I live alone so I’m fortunate I’m my own free man. My mum’s always very good. She never asks any questions. She’s had her troubles, like everyone, but she keeps going and pushing – like I do.”I can sense how hard Dunlop will push himself and his bike at the TT and so I thank him for giving me half an hour. He stretches out his hand and says: “No problem.”Outside, lines of people try to glimpse Dunlop inside his motorhome. He may turn out to be the mightiest Dunlop of them all but he looks lost to the world. Dunlop is hunched over a bike, talking to a mechanic, absorbed in his work. He almost looks happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce60288cd36a3fe7895dbe2a6f2a09822bd0c5c/0_14_3556_2134/master/3556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5598e42b89d6fbea7205dc5c33520a","title":"us national spelling bee facial expressions in pictures","story":"Competitors in the Scripps National Spelling Bee often struggle to contain their emotions when asked to spell obscure or complicated words.

It was all about Instagram for her and still is,” he said.“It’s a big plus that Facebook owns Instagram, but this is a problem for their flagship brand and platform that they really need to sink their teeth into.”Teens are highly prized by social platforms for a number of reasons: people tend to take their habits with them as they age, they give platforms the “cool factor” and attract advertisers. In Verna’s view, this demographic shift is a “greater existential threat” to Facebook than the privacy concerns to have emerged following the Cambridge Analytics scandal. Despite the teen exodus, Facebook remains the world’s largest social platform with 2.2 billion monthly users.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

You know how they go: blokes sitting in front of their massive vinyl collections and mixing desks, listing people from “back in the day”, showing off about how much they know, while dropping names and hinting at wild times. These shows can sometimes seem to be more about talking about the music than the music itself.Not this lovely one though, which is full of joy and wonderful music. Presenting is Rita Ray, broadcaster and DJ (she co-ran the legendary Mambo Inn in Brixton in the 1990s that I remember very fondly … hang on, who’s being boring and showing-off now?). Now, she’s starting her whistle-stop African music odyssey, which will also drop in to Mali and South Africa, in Nigeria.It is a serious, authoritative, fascinating music documentary that demonstrates how ancient rhythms formed the foundations and then punctuated the evolution of Nigerian popular music from juju and highlife to fuji, Fela Kuti’s Afrobeat, and now the Afrobeats (with an s) pop music revolution that is sweeping not just Africa but the world.But it’s not too muso-ish, or dull. Ray is also a massive fan and she’s travelled to Nigeria to find out what makes the country’s musicians tick.She has a dialog with a talking drum and meets (pop and actual Yoruba) royalty King Sunny Adé. She visits a musical hero, Orlando Julius, who sings along to his 1966 hit Jagua Nana. There’s highlife superstar Victor Uwaifo, who demonstrates his amazing spinning guitar, and then takes Ray for a spin in his equally amazing, apparently rocket-powered, car. Fela died back in 1997, but here’s son Femi Kuti, at the latest incarnation his dad’s legendary club the New Afrika Shrine continuing his father’s legacy, and continuing the Fela theme there’s Keziah Jones, who is the bridge between Fela and the pop music of today, says Ray.Africa: A Journey Into Music is on BBC4, Fridays at 10pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9942f103d2d1713034a7b78ca27d3a79f7fa044/0_31_7398_4438/master/7398.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=1949bfe8c1e568de7b4243b770daa647","title":"canada tariffs maple syrup imported from us","story":"Trump’s new tariffs highlighted a shift many Canadians didn’t realize: an increasing amount of American syrup is sold in CanadaWhen Justin Trudeau’s government launched retaliatory tariffs against the US this week, Canadians were not surprised to see one totemic product had been caught up in the brewing trade war. Maple syrup, produced in bulk and exported around the world, is seen as integral to the country’s identity. But the new duties prompted a shocking revelation for many Canadians: an increasing amount of American maple syrup is being sold in Canada.Canada long enjoyed de-facto leadership of global maple syrup production, largely thanks to producers in the province of Quebec . But the new tariffs – which the foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, characterized as “the strongest trade action Canada has taken in the post-war era” – highlighted a gradual shift that many Canadians did not realize has been quietly unfolding for years: the country’s tight grip on maple syrup is weakening. In 2016, Quebec imported $20m worth of syrup, almost all of it from the US. A number of people took to social media to digest the surprising revelation. Jesse Wente, a Toronto writer and film critic, wrote on Twitter: “I can’t wait for some of that American maple syrup!” said no one ever.”Another user said it was “offensive” that Canada even imported syrup.In a bid to unseat Canada as the largest producer – and taking advantage of a warming climate – American states are tapping maple trees at a rate nearly four times the rate of their Canadian counterparts. Much of this reflects a shift in consumer preference: with corn-based syrups losing popularity over the last few years, sales of maple syrup have surged. The tariffs, if they go into effect, will have their largest impact on producers in Vermont, which produces nearly half of all US syrup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e267608977292786a3ef14f09c36b5d6a18475/0_202_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43103474d3cffff305024f2f1e3f16c","title":"marine le pen rebrands front national in push for support","story":"Rassemblement National, as Front National is now known, aims to appeal to more voters ahead of European electionsFrench far-right leader Marine Le Pen has announced that the Front National party, founded by her father nearly a half-century ago, will now be called Rassemblement National (the National Rally).Le Pen all but kicked off the campaign for European parliamentary elections next year with the movethat reflects the party’s attempt to appeal to a broader range of voters at next year’s European electionsShe also denounced the “arrogant tyranny” of the European Union and the “European oligarchy barricaded in Brussels”.Under the new name, Le Pen’s aim is to rally people of all political stripes. The elections “can lead to a veritable European revolution,” she told the party’s political leadership at a meeting outside Lyon.The name change is a “historic moment in the life of our movement,” she said, unveiling a logo that puts its traditional flames inside a partially closed circle to signify new openness.Le Pen hopes the new populist government sworn in Friday in Italy will boost her anti-immigration party’s fortunes. Matteo Salvini, the head of Italy’s rightwing Lega party, which has joined in a government with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, is a friend of Le Pen.Front National scored higher in the 2014 European elections than any other French party, but the profile of Le Pen, a nationalist once at the centre of France’s political limelight, has dimmed since she was trounced by Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election a year ago.Le Pen’s niece, a rising star in Front National until she abruptly left the party after the 2017 presidential defeat, also threatens to steal the thunder from her aunt’s hoped-for revival.Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, a former lawmaker, recently dropped the family moniker from her last name. Her political ambitions remain undefined but no one doubts that she has them. She spoke at the annual conference of US conservatives in February, taking the podium after vice president Mike Pence. In September, she is opening a school in Lyon teaching French culture, political science and management to train the future rightwing elite.Marine Le Pen has worked to remove the racist and antisemitic stigma from the party co-founded by her father in 1972. She said at the party congress she wanted it to be viewed as a potential governing force, not just a protest movement. To make good on that, she formally severed all remaining ties to her firebrand father Jean-Marie Le Pen by eliminating his title of honorary president-for-life.The elder Le Pen, 89, was not happy with his daughter’s decision to rebrand the movement he started. Undoing the party’s identity is the “toughest blow” Front National has faced since its founding, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09fc5c0784d539f70e88edfa367d5c86937a7c80/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b09c9b49da6a4f7c37c0b547125384b","title":"phenomenal ardern nz mothers to be on the birth of a new kind of prime minister","story":"Parents and prospective parents reflect on motherhood, child-rearing and what it means to have a prime minister who is doing it tooIn mid-June Jacinda Ardern will become the second serving prime minister in history to give birth while in office. Ardern will take six weeks’ leave after giving birth and when she returns to work her partner, Clarke Gayford, will become a stay-at-home-dad.Here, New Zealand women with babies due in the same month discuss what it means to have a pregnant prime minister, and how they will balance parenthood, work and a severe lack of sleep.Jaime Faulkner, 36, lives in the rural town of Kawakawa in the Bay of Islands. Married for 12 years to Nathan, a dairy farmer, Faulkner is expecting her fourth child – a girl – on 1 June. Together, the couple have five children. Nathan will not take any leave.“When I heard the news, I wondered if Jacinda and I were due around the same time. My initial response was ‘wow, I wonder if we went to the same party.’ I was so happy for her, she is a phenomenal woman and to do what she does – she runs the country. All I do is run a little tribe. I am excited for her to be a mum and to experience that. I mean it does my head in every now and then, and you wish you could just have that one day to just be you, but you’d never change what you have once you’ve got it.At home, my eldest is about to turn 16, then 15, then 13, then 12, then 7. I usually get home at midnight, then have a bit of a break and get to bed. Then it’s rinse, lather and repeat really. Once we found out, it was a matter of making it work. Basically with my mindset it is as easy or as hard as you make it.I didn’t do this with the other children, it wasn’t really an option. The midwives I have now, they are offering it more these days. It is becoming more of a common practice. I was talking to a young girl in town, and she said how can you work three jobs and be eight months pregnant and look after all your kids? Jacinda’s pregnancy will encourage people and say to them ‘give it a go, it’s not as hard as you think it is’.”Rosie Whitley-Harford, 27, and husband Adam Harford,31, own their own home in the provincial east coast town of Gisborne, in the North Island. Adam is a school teacher and Rosie is a qualified early childhood educator. They are expecting their first child on 10 June. Rosie: “We found out I was pregnant the day after I resigned. So that made it quite difficult. I was quite unwell for the first trimester, too, and then it dwindled off. It definitely wasn’t easy at the start. Adam would have to get up in the morning and do me Marmite on toast before I would even get out of bed.”Adam: “Yeah had to, because even if she put her feet on the ground before she got toast in her she’d have a bad day.”Rosie: “We know how important it is to have that one person at home. The first three years are so important. So we have decided to have me stay home, and maybe in a year’s time we can talk about me going back to work, or maybe I won’t want to.”Adam: “Yeah, we have kind of set ourselves up to function off my sole income. So if Rosie needs to stay home, if we want her to stay home, then she can. We know we’re not going to get to go out to dinner every weekend, but that’s the life we’ve set up because that’s more important to us.”Rosie: “Lots of people say after that paid parental leave stops, that’s when you realise how tight things can be.”Adam: “We are learning to live within our means. Our type of car is not exactly luxurious. We eat plain meals. We don’t get the best cuts of steak. We live pretty Kiwi I suppose.”Adam: “According to my collective agreement I get two days paid leave. I think if things go smoothly, a safe birth, we are hoping just for a week off eh?”Rosie: “Yeah. I think love is a really big thing. That is our biggest thing, to portray love and kindness, so that is nurtured in the child.”And a lot of people were quick to judge it, but at the end of the day she still has to live her life. She’s not just the prime minister.”Adam: “I wasn’t really concerned with any of the political nonsense or her being able to carry her role out, I was just happy for her as a person.Autumn Falk, a medical herbalist, and Jenni Werth, a former occupational therapist, own a medicinal tea business and live in Katikati, Bay of Plenty. They have a tea bar in a caravan which they take to markets and festivals. Autumn: “It has been a really long process. It was early on in our relationship that we decided we wanted to have children.”Jenni: “About six years ago we met the father who is a really good friend of ours. And pretty much asked him straightaway and he was like ‘yeah, no problem’. Then, when it came down to it, I think it was a bit more serious thought involved.”Autumn: “He will be involved in kind of an uncle position. Obviously, the child will know this is their father, yeah. He will definitely have involvement and come and go I guess.”Jenni: “He won’t have any decision-making rights around raising the baby, but he will definitely be involved.”Jenni: “I will be full-time mothering for the first year, then we will see how it goes, I have always wanted to parent, and Autumn is very content with going to work and providing. She is really happy doing that and I am happy being on the land and working in the gardens and being at home.”Autumn: “A lot of people speak to us and say ‘oh your baby is also due in June!’. Just like the prime minister’s one.”Jenni: “We haven’t followed her pregnancy to the extreme. I am more intrigued with how much of a difference it might make in her understanding of what it’s like to be a working mum – and she’s obviously at one extreme of the spectrum. I think we are really privileged in New Zealand to have a prime minister who is going to know what that’s like. Because a lot of the decisions that get made in this country are made by people who have no idea what it’s like to be in that situation, and to be outside of a situation and make decisions for a population … it’s a big ask. Autumn: “I find this quite an extraordinary situation. She is a woman, there are not many countries with leading women in power, and she is young enough to be able to have a child. It is pretty impressive overall.”Jenni: “I think this will give women a boost, of really believing anything is possible. I really hope for her sake she doesn’t get over-scrutinised with how she manages. But I think it is going to inspire a lot of women.”Jenni: “I am worried about the lack of sleep.”Jenni: “It is probably way worse than everyone says.”Robin Burnell, 27, a franchise support worker for a cafe chain and her husband, Sam, 28, a plumber, live in Christchurch and are expecting their first child on 30 June.Robin: “I grew up really wanting a family. It was really important for both of us. I am just very clucky, very keen on children, very keen on babies.Change is always challenging, I think. And my normal becoming new is a little bit daunting. But I am really excited, too. A lot of people have talked about not realising how much love you could have for a baby until they are there.I plan to do six months off. And Sam would love a day at home with the baby as well.”Sam: “I would love to stay home. But it is all money related. If I can stay home I really want to.”I don’t think she is setting the bar too high, because every pregnancy is different. I just think she is very brave and confident. I think it would be awesome if the government reviewed how much paid parental leave is available to new parents. I know New Zealand is quite low down compared to other countries, which is hard when they don’t provide paid childcare until minimum two years old and most cases three years old.It is quite a strain. I think we have a lot of good things in New Zealand, but lengthening paid parental leave would definitely help.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoI screamed and roared at his disappearance, and a nun slapped me right across the face\u0026rsquoMinister told support group he was committed to finding an interim solution pending new lawT\u0026aacutenaiste says EU Brexit group must receive written plans in advance of crunch summitAbortion result means \u0026lsquo10 years down the road there could be no more Special Olympics\u0026rsquoMinister to announce programme to improve infrastructure and attract visitorsSources should not be protected in every instance, says journalist and academicCards are \u0026lsquooperating near normal\u0026rsquo after customers were left unable to pay for purchasesAll unmarked abortion placards must be reported to garda\u0026iacute, says south Dublin councilHundreds of households left without power across the countyCourt of Appeal deems suspended term too lenient and imposes custodial sentenceTours of \u0026lsquoamazing\u0026rsquo vessels will be available in Docklands over bank holiday weekendCall comes in wake of Quest move to have Mhic Mhath\u0026uacutena\u0026rsquos children seen by psychologist\u0026lsquoLack of communication and consultation with survivors is not helping but causing hurt and harm\u0026rsquoOver 200 craft and more than 600 rowers to participate in An Ras Mor from Crosshaven to the city quaysCause of incident unknown as several fire engines dispatched to extinguish blaze\u0026lsquoThe boys played a great style of rugby.

The Government has said substantial progress on the Border, including the so-called “backstop”, must be made by this summit.“In the next two weeks, we need to see written proposals,” Mr Coveney told The . “It needs to happen two weeks from the summit.”Mr Coveney’s warning reflects increasing exasperation in Dublin and Brussels that no firm proposals have emerged from London, with just weeks until the summit.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Coveney and other senior Ministers such as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe have repeatedly told their UK counterparts that such proposals are needed soon.“There’s a new idea or solution being mooted every week,” said a senior Government source, adding that Dublin was only “interested in proposals that are written down”.“On paper like. Or on a screen. We are at legal text stage. We need legal texts to draft and debate.”A leaked proposal on Friday from UK Brexit secretary David Davis – that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a “buffer zone” to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland – was dismissed by Government figures.The latest proposals were also dismissed by the Democratic Unionist Party which urged its Conservative partners in the UK government to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.On the buffer zone, one Government source in Dublin said it only moved a potential physical border, rather than ensuring that no physical border would be in place after Brexit.The UK and EU are due to agree a withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, by October, but the Government has warned this will be thrown into doubt unless substantial progress is made this month.The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.“If there is no progress on the backstop, we are in for an uncertain summer,” Mr Coveney said. “At this point we need written proposals on the Irish backstop consistent with what was agreed. We await written proposals from the British side.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has voted No to tribalism and fear in overwhelming decision to remove the Eighth   May 27, 2018Thirty-five years after its introduction, Eighth Amendment repealed after bitter campaign   May 28, 2018Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fight   June 1, 2018The victory belongs to everyone but any analysis that does not place at its centre the feminist, women-led movement is bereft "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Instead it urged Britain to engage with the EU “in a more detailed way” on the parts of the draft Brexit treaty relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the “backstop” option that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and single market if no other solution was found to avoid a hard border.“At this stage in the process, the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop,” said a spokesman for the department.“The engagement must be through the formal negotiation with the Task Force, led by Michel Barnier. The Tánaiste and Irish officials are in ongoing contact with the EU Task Force team.”Mr Davis’s plan is a revision of the “max fac” or “maximum facilitation” plan, the report said, citing a source.British prime minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options.One would be “max fac” in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.The other option being considered is a “customs partnership”, according to which the UK would co-operate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border.The European Union previously criticised Ms May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Britain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce dismissed the idea of a 10-mile Border buffer zone being considered by the UK government as “unworkable.”“Moving the problem of the Border to 10 miles away won’t solve the problem,” said John McGrane, the director-general of the chamber. “All that will happen in a dual-territory model is added costs of complying with double regulations - and more costs means less jobs.”The chamber was “aghast” that, with the clock on negotiations “ticking down daily towards a potential hard Brexit,” that the UK government is still not saying clearly how it will deliver a borderless future for trade both northsouth and eastwest between the UK and Ireland, he said. - additional reporting - ReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516384.1527861751!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china influencing new zealand at every level of society report claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern (centre) at a media briefing in Wellington on Monday. Photograph: Nick PerryAPA report released by Canada’s spy agency has warned that New Zealand, one of its closest allies, has been influenced at every level of society by the Chinese government, and that the situation has reached a “critical” stage.The report states that New Zealand is viewed as “the soft underbelly” of its western big brothers such as the UK and US.“President Xi Jinping is driving a multi-dimensional strategy to lift China to global dominance,” it stated, and New Zealand was a key pawn in its strategy, with the government regarding its relations with the island nation as “an exemplar” of how it would like to steer future relations with other states.The report was published by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) but does not reflect the spy agency’s official views, and was based on reports to CSIS during an academic workshop.The report claimed New Zealand’s business, political and intellectual elite had all been targeted by the Chinese Communist Party, and that business tie-ups with companies, universities and research centres had been used to “influence activities and to provide access to military technology, commercial secrets and other strategic information”.“Massive efforts” had also been made to bring Chinese-language media and Chinese community groups under the party’s control, and political donations have been made, it said.“New Zealand provides a vivid case study of China’s willingness to use economic ties to interfere with the political life of a partner country,” the report stated, warning that smaller states were “particularly vulnerable” to Chinese influence. New Zealand is home to just 4.7 million people.“An aggressive strategy has sought to influence political decision-making, pursue unfair advantages in trade and business, suppress criticism of China, facilitate espionage opportunities, and influence overseas Chinese communities.”New Zealand appealed to China as a strategic ally for numerous reasons, the report said. New Zealand administers the defence and foreign affairs of the neighbouring Pacific Island territories of Niue, Tokelau, and the Cook Islands, which means “four potential votes for China at international forums”.Legislative change in 2011 has also made New Zealand “a hotspot for global money laundering”, a reputation shared by its territories, and the country is also a claimant in Antarctica and geographically one of the closest countries to it.New Zealand has “cheap arable land and a sparse population”, a thriving dairy sector in which China is the largest foreign investor, a burgeoning space programme allowing rockets to be launched from the Mahia peninsula, unexplored petroleum reserves as well as expertise in multilateral trade negotiations, Pacific affairs, Antarctic science, and horticultural science which is “useful” for China, it said.The country’s membership of the Five Eyes (an intelligence sharing network between Australia, the US, England, Canada and New Zealand) as well as Nato and other important military partnerships is also appealing.“Some of these activities endanger New Zealand’s national security directly, while others have a more long-term corrosive effect.”New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said New Zealand had a “very strong” relationship with Canada, particularly with its prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “I have had no indication that our Five Eyes membership is under question, from Canada or any other of our partners, nor have I heard that it has been raised with any of my colleagues,” she said.“New Zealand is vigilant against any interference that is intended to harm our values, institutions and economy.”Last week, New Zealand’s foreign affairs minister travelled to China for a three-day visit, and met “high-ranking Chinese officials” including foreign minister Wang Yi, Politburo member and former minister of foreign affairs Yang Jiechi and the head of the Communist party’s international department, Song Tao. “Our discussions were wide-ranging, covering all aspects of our bilateral relationship,” said Peters in a statement, including expansion of trade and economic ties, upcoming FTA discussions, and peace and security in the Asia-Pacific.

Eighty-five per cent of the dogs running on British greyhound tracks every year are Irish, with British trainers typically sending bitches to Ireland for breeding.The free movement of dogs between the two islands has flourished since at least the late 1860s, when Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup three times to become the most celebrated dog in the world. Master McGrath was commemorated with a statue in Lurgan and a monument in his home town of Dungarvan, and inspired a ballad that framed his race against an English competitor in terms of British-Irish rivalry: As Rose and the Master they both ran along, ‘Now I wonder,’ says Rose, ‘what took you from your home You should have stayed there in your Irish domain, And not come to gain laurels on Albion’s plain.’ ‘Well, I know,’ says McGrath, ‘we have wild heather bogs But you’ll find in old Ireland there’s good men and dogs. Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw, Stuff that up your nostrils,’ says Master McGrath.Greyhound racing in Britain has been in decline since the 1950s, with the number of tracks falling from more than 100 to fewer than 30. Unlike horse racing, which benefits from a levy on betting, greyhound racing receives no subsidy from the bookmakers.Live hare coursing, the sport in which Master McGrath won his laurels, is banned in Britain, but accusations of cruelty continue to pursue dog racing, which has also been damaged by scandals around doping after dogs were given cocaine to run faster. At the English Greyhound Derby lunch in London this week, its chairman, Alexander Hesketh, identified animal welfare as the greatest challenge facing the sport.Hesketh, a hereditary peer whose seat in the House of Lords was abolished in 1999, owns Towcester race course and is on a mission to modernise greyhound racing in Britain and around the world. The owners of every dog that runs at his course must pay a fee of £200, which is matched by Towcester to create what he calls a “canine pension fund” to rehome greyhounds when their racing days are over. Greyhound races now publish injury statistics, which show that injuries and deaths are lower than in horse racing, and Hesketh will soon launch a “Towcester standard” guaranteeing high welfare standards for animals.Hesketh was chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives in 2011 to join Ukip and has been an enthusiastic advocate for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. One of his passions is now in conflict with another, however, as Brexit threatens to complicate the free movement of dogs between Ireland and Britain.Liam Dowling, who breeds greyhounds at Ballymac Kennels in\u0026nbspBallymacelligott, \u0026nbspCo Kerry, has already seen his business suffer from the 14 per cent depreciation in sterling since the Brexit vote two years ago.“Our kennels are only 10 minutes from Farranfore, Kerry Airport. In that sense we are 90 minutes from London. We’re closer to London than Dublin for many interested buyers. But since the depreciation in Sterling, a lot less buyers are flying in to consider buying a greyhound. After the recession in 2008, our family business thought we were past all of that but the prospect of Brexit means more uncertainty,” he said.Currently, dogs travelling to Britain require a pet passport, a rabies vaccination and a health check by a vet 48 hours prior to travel with a registered transporter.\u0026nbspThat process could become more complicated and time-consuming if Britain leaves the EU without a deal or if the greyhound industry is not protected in a future trade agreement. Gerard Dollard, chief executive of Bord na gCon, is anxious about the impact of Brexit on an industry that involves 12,000 people and generates €300 million in economic activity.“Brexit is a game-changer for the greyhound sector,” he said. “There are thousands of jobs across rural Ireland dependent on a vibrant industry. There are no alternative export markets. As the semi-State body responsible for the commercial development of the sector, engagement has been ongoing between Bord na gCon and the Department of Agriculture. Their officials recognise the economic and social risk that potentially arises from Brexit. Like other sectors we need in as far as possible a frictionless border.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516834.1527886340!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup dismisses uk government s half cooked ideas on border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP MP Sammy Wilson said  none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. File image: Leon NealAFPGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the British Conservative Party to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on dealing with the Border and to provide clarity on its Brexit plan.Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis was reported on Thursday to be creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the Border that would be in effect for local traders, such as dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, The Sun newspaper reported.A 10-mile wide “special economic zone” would be created along the 310-mile border, within which local traders could operate under the Republic’s trade rules.The DUP, which props up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government at Westminster, has made clear that it does not want Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.He said: “First of all, to suggest that Northern Ireland be tied to both EU and UK regulations, when one of the objectives of leaving the single market is to allow the UK to set its own regulations, raises the question which regulations apply to Northern Ireland if and when the UK and the EU regulations erge?“Secondly, who will make the judgement as to which regulations should apply? Will it be the EU or the UK Government? Will it be the UK courts or the European Court of Justice?”Mr Wilson said the purpose of the border buffer zone “appears to be even less clear”. He asked what would happen to trade from outside the buffer zone when it crossed into the zone and if checks would have to be carried out there.Mr Wilson said the British Government must make it clear that all of the borders that would exist as a consequence of Britain leaving the EU “whether that is between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the Irish Republic and Great Britain, or Great Britain and Europe all present the same problems”.He concluded: “Instead of moving from one set of half-cooked ideas to the other it is now time for the Government to put down its foot and make it clear to EU negotiators that the Prime Minister stands by her commitment that no deal is better than a bad deal and if they want to avoid the consequences then they need to stop dismissing the perfectly feasible ideas that were put forward in August of last year.”Sinn Féin accused Mr Davis of trying to “hide a hard border in a buffer zone”.MEP Martina Anderson said: “Once again this shows the lack of knowledge of border areas and the concerns they face - David Davis obviously didn’t learn much on his flying visits.”Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU did not deny that the proposal was under consideration.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that we cannot and will not accept a customs border down the Irish Sea, and that we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s common market.” - Additional reporting PANegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.US Defense Secretary Mattis accuses China of \u0026#39intimidation and coercion\u0026#39 in South China SeaTrafford Park crash: Woman dies after car ploughs into pedestrians  in Manchester hit-and-runFive dead, nearly 200 ill in US romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak Police smash plot to smuggle £4m worth of cannabis into UKBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 5: stuffed with potential stars, the show finally finds its form ahead of the finalLa Macarena could be the answer to staying alive, heart study findsFitbits could help save the lives of thousands of chemotherapy patients Benedict Cumberbatch \u0026#39fights off muggers who attacked Deliveroo cyclist\u0026#39HMRC\u0026#39s spend on consultants rises by 9,000pc as MPs attack \u0026#39staggering\u0026#39 cost increaseScotland \u0026#39could be hit with more tax hikes\u0026#39 after sudden £389 million budget fallHow Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39Virtual Wards\u0026#39 could hold the key to keeping elderly patients out of hospital Student becomes fifth Grenfell Tower fraudster to be convictedTrump admits he hasn\u0026#39t read letter after saying it was \u0026#39very nice\u0026#39Cambridge graduate jailed for brutal rapes saw himself as \u0026#39Christian Grey\u0026#39Chessington powercut sees people stranded on ridesCould Archers villain Rob be set to make a return?

The GPS signal from a device on his collar then disappeared, and for two years, his whereabouts were unknown.He has now become the first Iberian lynx seen in Catalonia for more than a hundred years, after conservation officials tracked him down to a wooded area in Barcelona following reports of sightings.To avoid attracting curious crowds, authorities have declined to release details of his location.Conservation officials released pictures of the lynx lounging under the shade of a tree, apparently in good health and unfazed by his surroundings.They are now working with experts from IberLince, the EU-funded rehabilitation programme, on a plan to capture Lithium as he is “in an unsuitable location to guarantee his security”, close to roads and urban centres.Map: Rare Iberian lynx spotted in Barcelona“This is the first time the presence of an Iberian Lynx has been detected in Catalonia since the beginning of the 20th century,” they said in a statement.Santi Palazón, a biologist from the Catalan Generalitat\u0027s Flora and Fauna Service, told El Periodico newspaper that while the adventurous lynx seemed to have adapted to his environment, it made no sense to leave him in Catalonia, alone.The lynx’s trek across the Iberian Peninsula - crossing mountains, valleys and rivers - is all the more impressive given that a previous attempt to introduce him to the wild ended in failure.He was last seen two years ago in the Guadiana Valley, southeastern PortugalBorn in 2014 in a captive breeding centre in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, Lithium was first released the following year but was recaptured in early 2016 as he was struggling to adapt.Showing signs of weakness, he spent a spell at an endangered species recovery centre before his second release.Iberian Lynx numbers dwindled to just 94 in 2002 but rehabilitation efforts are paying off, with 589 found in a 2017 provisional census of the species.Please review our commenting policyUS Defense Secretary Mattis accuses China of \u0026#39intimidation and coercion\u0026#39 in South China SeaTrafford Park crash: Woman dies after car ploughs into pedestrians  in Manchester hit-and-runFive dead, nearly 200 ill in US romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak Police smash plot to smuggle £4m worth of cannabis into UKBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 5: stuffed with potential stars, the show finally finds its form ahead of the finalLa Macarena could be the answer to staying alive, heart study findsFitbits could help save the lives of thousands of chemotherapy patients Benedict Cumberbatch \u0026#39fights off muggers who attacked Deliveroo cyclist\u0026#39HMRC\u0026#39s spend on consultants rises by 9,000pc as MPs attack \u0026#39staggering\u0026#39 cost increaseScotland \u0026#39could be hit with more tax hikes\u0026#39 after sudden £389 million budget fallHow Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39Virtual Wards\u0026#39 could hold the key to keeping elderly patients out of hospital Student becomes fifth Grenfell Tower fraudster to be convictedTrump admits he hasn\u0026#39t read letter after saying it was \u0026#39very nice\u0026#39Cambridge graduate jailed for brutal rapes saw himself as \u0026#39Christian Grey\u0026#39Chessington powercut sees people stranded on ridesCould Archers villain Rob be set to make a return?

Their parents may or may not be their natural parents.They may be children of parents with very different religious, ethnic or national backgrounds. They may be the children of polygamous marriages. Their siblings may be only half-siblings or step-siblings. Some children are brought up by two parents of the same sex. Some children are conceived by artificial donor insemination. Some are the result of surrogacy arrangements.He said the growth of international relationships had been fuelled by technology and cheap airfares, while same-sex relationships which had previously been regarded as perversions to be stamped out by the more or less enthusiastic enforcement of a repressive criminal law were now treated with acceptance and respect.The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics show that there are around 10,000 same-sex couples in the UK who have dependent children. Parental orders made as part of surrogacy arrangements have grown from less than 50 a year before 2008 to 300 a year currently. The legal low-down | Solicitor Nicola Scott’s advice for anyone thinking about surrogacyIn the speech made at Liverpool University in honour of 20th century social reformer Eleanor Rathbone, he called for family law to adapt itself to these realities and described the pace of change maddeningly slow. Last year he spoke out about funding for mental health services after finding that there was no secure place anywhere in the country for a suicidal teenage girl to go. He warned the country would have blood on our hands if she was released into the community and killed herself. He said he received criticism for the intervention but remained unrepentant.There are occasions, and this, in my judgment, was one, where a judge’s sworn duty to do “right” includes speaking truth to power, he said. Recalling the case in his speech this week, he said judges should have more power to decide what happens to children in such situations. Courts are currently barred from intervening in the work of local authorities, and Sir James called for new legislation to change this. The courts have to be properly equipped for their vital problem-solving role, he said, as judges are currently limited to the blunted weapons of persuasion and shaming. Sir James, who is due to retire next month as he turns 70, is a well-known supporter of no-fault orce, and has previously called for the family courts to become more transparent in order to increase public trust in the system. Last year he ruled that laws which restricted the use of surrogacy to couples, excluding single people, were discriminatory, prompting the Government to change them. He has also warned that too many children are being criminalised by the CPS and called for cohabiting couples to get the same rights as married people. US Defense Secretary Mattis accuses China of \u0026#39intimidation and coercion\u0026#39 in South China SeaTrafford Park crash: Woman dies after car ploughs into pedestrians  in Manchester hit-and-runFive dead, nearly 200 ill in US romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak Police smash plot to smuggle £4m worth of cannabis into UKBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 5: stuffed with potential stars, the show finally finds its form ahead of the finalLa Macarena could be the answer to staying alive, heart study findsFitbits could help save the lives of thousands of chemotherapy patients Benedict Cumberbatch \u0026#39fights off muggers who attacked Deliveroo cyclist\u0026#39Scotland \u0026#39could be hit with more tax hikes\u0026#39 after sudden £389 million budget fallHMRC\u0026#39s spend on consultants rises by 9,000pc as MPs attack \u0026#39staggering\u0026#39 cost increaseHow Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39Virtual Wards\u0026#39 could hold the key to keeping elderly patients out of hospital Student becomes fifth Grenfell Tower fraudster to be convictedTrump admits he hasn\u0026#39t read letter after saying it was \u0026#39very nice\u0026#39Cambridge graduate jailed for brutal rapes saw himself as \u0026#39Christian Grey\u0026#39Chessington powercut sees people stranded on ridesCould Archers villain Rob be set to make a return?

Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, said more children are being potty trained at an older age, with parents struggling to teach their children over just two days at the weekend. Ms Spielman warned in a speech to nursery leaders\u0026nbsptoday\u0026nbspthat more and more children are not toilet trained when they arrive at school, adding that they “risk being teased” by classmates. Speaking to the media at the Pre-School Learning Alliance conference, the head of the schools’ watchdog suggested that nursery workers need to take a greater role in helping to potty train young children. “Without taking responsibility away from parents, if your child is in nursery every day,\u0026nbsptoilet training is not something you can do in two days over the weekend, and say boom, it is done.“In practice it becomes something that’s got to be a bit of a cooperative exercise.”Ms Spielman added that potty training used to be done by parents before a child went near formal childcare – but now the responsibility has been blurred as more children enter pre-school provision. Her warnings come after a report this week revealed that teachers lose more than a million hours every year teaching children basic hygiene and how to use the toilet.The Ofsted leader’s speech to nursery leaders this morning highlighted the rising number of youngsters who lack basic hygiene and language skills when they turn up to school at the age of four. Some parents do not appreciate the importance of early education and teaching young children life skills – such as how to communicate or use the toilet, early years experts said at the conference. There has been an increase in young children with issues such as poor language skills and there has been a lack of involvement and interaction by some parents with pre-school children, they said. Gary Jeffries, a nursery manager from Birmingham, who has 16 years’ experience in the industry, said the fact that a lot of parents were spending time on their phones had contributed to the problem.Mr Jeffries said: “I would say that not all parents value early years, and I don’t think the government values it enough.”He added that parents may need help and guidance on reading to children, how to speak to them, dietary requirements, and some “may not know where to start with things like potty training”.“I always say to my parents, if you haven’t got time to do anything at home, but have got time to do one thing, education-wise I always just say, read a bedtime story, read, read, read, talk to them, ask them questions, point things out when you’re in the supermarket, on a car journey,” he said.Melanie Pilcher, quality and standards manager for the Pre-School Learning Alliance, who has managed and worked in nurseries, said: “It’s always been the case with children that it takes longer to get dry, to potty train, but from what our members are telling us, they are finding these things are increasing.“The big issue is we have parents who need help but don’t know it. When you’ve got a parent who needs help and wants help and recognises it, then they will seek it with you and we are able to signpost.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And a decision will have to be made as to whether we accept it or not.”It adds: “It cannot be right that 650 MPs alone decide whether to accept the deal, without any say for Londoners or people across the country. That’s why we think it’s essential that there is a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, so that 65 million people can have their voices heard as well.”The letter sets out the need to stop Brexit from damaging London’s status as “a cultural capital, a sporting powerhouse” and “a hub for international business, civil society and media”.While it accepts that the 2016 referendum gave the government a mandate to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, it says ministers do not have a mandate to “force a bad Brexit deal on our city.”It argues that London, “represents all the most positive elements of being global, outward-looking, welcoming and tolerant. These values form part of the fabric of London. A bad Brexit deal risks tearing that fabric apart.”Up to now Mr Corbyn has doggedly resisted the idea of a public vote on the final deal, saying that the country should “respect” the result of the referendum in June 2016.Ten of the MPs went further\u0026nbspand backed a call for an option in any referendum to be remaining in the EU on current terms.Labour HQ declined to comment on Friday, but the Labour membership, which twice backed Mr Corbyn to lead the party, is believed to be largely against Brexit.While the exact geographical breakdown of Labour’s membership is not public data, insiders say numbers are heavily weighted towards London and other urban centres.Mr Corbyn and the most senior members of his shadow cabinet, like John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, Barry Gardiner and Sir Keir Starmer all hold seats in the capital, which overwhelmingly backed Remain in the referendum.It comes after 12 Welsh Labour MPs, including shadow ministerial aides Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi, both defied the party line to sign a similar letter.Five MPs from Labour’s heartlands in the Northeast also signed a letter published by The Independent in May calling for backing the People’s Vote campaign, as did four\u0026nbspMerseyside\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand the city’s mayor.Last month Janet Daby\u0026nbspdefeated rivals supported by the Corbyn-backing Momentum group and Unite to become Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the Lewisham East byelection next month, having stood on a ticket of fighting to keep the UK in the single market.Anti-Brexit left-wingers announced they will\u0026nbsptour\u0026nbspBritain this summer in a campaign to build opposition to leaving the EU – calling on Mr Corbyn to back Remain and negotiate a “new settlement” with Brussels.The internal struggle in the party could come to a head when the Commons votes on whether to keep the UK in the single market in coming weeks, with Mr Corbyn currently refusing to back the plan.Labour’s current position is that that Britain’s EU membership must end and that the country should leave the\u0026nbspsingle market\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcustoms union\u0026nbspto negotiate new relationships to replace them.But the House of Lords, including more than 80 Labour peers who rebelled against Mr Corbyn’s will, passed an amendment to Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Bill that would see the UK remain inside the single market if it also now gets approved by the Commons.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yulin Dog Eating Festival: MILLIONS of campaigners gather to stop itHe has been campaigning since the start and the last five years have seen him visiting Yulin\u0026rsquos dog slaughter houses, interviewing dog meat traders, supervising research projects and also rescuing cats and dogs.\u0026ldquoI was involved in the campaign against the dog meat trade in 2010 when the Yulin Dog Meat Festival was officially launched, he says.\u0026ldquoThe festival was so obnoxious and offensive to the Chinese and international animal activists that a global campaign was on the horizon.\u0026ldquoIn 2010, the Yulin Dog Meat Festival was a huge public display of humans\u0026rsquo gross inhumanity to dogs. Dogs were caged on the streets, in front of restaurants, and on the markets for the consumers to pick and slaughter in broad daylight and in front of terrified dogs and young children.\u0026ldquoIt was shocking and sad to see the Yulin officials\u0026rsquo lack of care and concern for the psychological well-being of Yulin\u0026rsquos young children.\u0026ldquoPublic slaughter of dogs celebrated as a \u0026lsquofestival\u0027 was totally offensive to even many Chinese young and educated urbanites. Since then, I have been to Yulin many time and liaised with Chinese activists on many dog rescue incidents in mainland China.NCPeter Li believes that Yulin\u0026rsquos days are numberedHe now believes that Yulin\u0026rsquos days are numbered.I am optimistic, he explains. \u0026ldquoChina outlawed foot-binding, infanticide, arranged marriage and opium-smoking. It will outlaw the dog meat trade eventually.\u0026ldquoUrbanisation and increase of disposable income have changed people\u0026rsquos attitudes towards animals. Pet keeping allows people to develop a bond not only with dogs and cats but also sympathy for other non-human animals.\u0026ldquoThe Yulin Dog Meat Festival was at its worst in 2010-2012. Since 2013, and particularly 2014, the event is a far more muted affair, and the overt signs of a typical \u0026lsquofestival\u0026rsquo are no longer present.\u0026ldquoWe used to see around 10,000 dogs being killed whereas now it\u0026rsquos more like 2-3,000 dogs, so progress is being made, albeit slowly.For more details of HSI petition, see: www.hsi.orgendyulin"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Brexit-Irish-border-968319.jpg","title":"brexit news irish border ireland david davis proposal","story":"Brexit news: Irish border proposals put forward by David Davis has been slated by Sinn Fein and DUPIreland\u0026rsquos biggest unionist and nationalist parties joined sides to hit out at Mr Davis\u0026rsquos proposals, with the Brexit secretary accused of not having \u0026ldquolearned much during his visits to Northern Ireland in the 24 months since the 2016 Brexit vote.Mr Davis is believed to have convinced Prime Minister Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet to support his latest proposal for a bloated, economic free-for-all border and the alignment of Northern Irish trade to both the UK and EU red tape.But while the unusual scheme may have gained the support of Mrs May and her cabinet, the proposal has been deemed immediately unworkable by the two biggest parties in Northern Ireland - as well as Brussels.Detailed in this morning\u0026rsquos Sun newspaper, the proposal was almost immediately torn apart by the DUP and Sinn Fein - two parties who are ided on almost every other issue in Northern Irish politics.The DUP said the plan treated Northern Ireland differently that the rest of the UK - a red-line for the ultra-unionist party which has been propping up Mrs May in government since her election gamble backfired last summer.Senior MP Sammy Wilson told MailOnline: \u0026ldquoIt immediately raises all kinds of questions, first of all about the commitment not to have Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK.\u0026ldquoIf it is kite flying then we need to cut the strings on that kite pretty quickly.Sinn Fein also hit out at the proposal, accusing Mr Davis of learning little during his frequent - if short and closely-guarded - trips to Ireland\u0027s border.\u0026nbspDavid Davis has been accused of having \u0027not learned much\u0027 during his Irish border visitsMEP Martina Anderson said: Once again this shows the lack of knowledge of border areas and the concerns they face - David Davies obviously didn\u0026rsquot learn much on his flying visits.The creation of a buffer zone would merely move the problem away from the border and hide a hard border in a buffer zone.And Labour also stuck a boot in as Mr Davis\u0026rsquo proposal crumbled barely hours after being revealed.MP Virendra Sharma said : With these latest proposals anyone would think the government is making this up as they going along.Brexit news: Sinn Fein and the DUP agree on little but both have slated David Davis The UK has 30 days to propose a viable solution to the Irish border question before this month\u0026rsquos EU summit.With Brussels previously confirming Dublin has a veto, any failure to proposer a workable solution would result in the Republic of Ireland pulling the plug on exit agreement talks.In April Irish taoiseach (prime minster) Leo Varadkar said: \u0026ldquoWithout the Irish border there can be no withdrawal agreement.

Isa savings: Get in early and make most of tax-free savingsLower income families would receive double the amount, taking the total so far to up to \u0026pound1,000 in savings.New evidence suggests not everyone is claiming the money because they are not aware it even exists.If a parent didn\u0026rsquot open a Child Trust Fund, the government did it for them.Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, said: Part of the problem is many people never got engaged in the process in the first instance. STOCKAn initial \u0026pound250 voucher was given to parents when the CTF openedNearly one in three parents did not make an active decision on where this free gift was going to be placed and instead left it up to the Government to appoint a provider.This has meant many of these accounts, which could hold over \u0026pound400 million, may simply have been forgotten about.The CTF was replaced with Junior ISAs in 2011, but any account that was previously set up, along with the money in it, still exists.Research by ISA provider Scottish Friendly from 2015 found one in four of these accounts and the money held within in them, have been forgotten about.It found an estimated 1.5 million of the 6.3 million CTFs opened on behalf of children have never had any additional funds put into them outside of the Government\u0026rsquos contribution.Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst from Hargreaves Lansdown, said: You only had 60 days to decide where to put your CTF voucher, and if you were too busy to make a choice, the government would have picked one for you.It\u0026rsquos no wonder that somewhere between 900,000 and 1.5 million CTFs have been forgotten about.ISA advice from Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis.

These conditions are likely to last through the weekend, but as we move towards the middle of the month the forecast becomes much more uncertain.\u0026ldquoThere is always a risk of scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms could affect southern and western parts at times, but there will be some dry and bright weather here too.Hot weather last month is likely to have brought a record-breaking set of May temperature and sunshine records, according to government forecasters.The provisional average daily maximum temperature for May was 17C (62.6F) making it the warmest since 1910 beating the 16.9C (62.42F) set in 1992, the Met Office said.More than 245 hours of sunshine also brought the sunniest May in records dating back to 1929 beating 1989 when 241.7 hours of sunshine baked Britain during the first month of spring.Tim Legg, spokesman for the Met Office\u0026rsquos National Climate Information Centre, said: \u0026ldquoIncreased sunshine during the month has helped to keep daytime temperatures high, leading to it provisionally being the warmest May since records began in 1910.\u0026ldquoIt is also likely to be the sunniest May since 1929."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/183x122/968122_1.jpg","title":"italy news giuseppe conte prime minister new government","story":"The swearing in of the new government took place in a ceremony at the Quirinale Palace in Rome.Lega\u0026rsquos leader Matteo Salvini and M5S leader Luigi Di Maio reached an agreement to form a coalition government and assigned the 18 ministerial posts available after a four-hour long meeting.Both party leaders will hold the position of deputy prime minister of a government led by the 53-year-old law professor Giuseppe Conte.Mr Salvini will also hold the position of interior minister, while Mr Di Maio with also take the position as minister of economic development.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It dived down and up again and dived and disappeared.It was not a boat. I would say it was Nessie.”The Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register, which keeps a record of every possible glimpse of Nessie, believes Eoin filmed the real deal.Gary Campbell, keeper of the sightings register, said: As far as Nessie footage goes, this is a feature film.Normally you only get videos of one or two seconds. It is remarkable in its length.Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections.But wider interest wasnt sparked until 1933 after a road was built along the loch, making it far less isolated.Within months, several people came forward claiming to have seen a giant beast lurking near the water.Theories reached fever pitch a year later when the infamous surgeon’s photograph - probably the best-known image of the creature - emerged.But in 1975 the famous shot was exposed as a hoax, made using a toy submarine with a carved monster’s head.There have now been over 1,000 reported sightings.In 2017, the story of the Loch Ness monster topped a poll of the UKs greatest unexplained mysteries.The object would be no larger than 20ft.”It follows nine sightings of the elusive beast in the last year alone.Just last week, eight-year-old Laria Annand and her gran Marie claimed to have caught Nessie on camera while going for a paddle in the iconic lake."},{"url":null,"title":"inverness primary school ends boy girl only races sports day","story":"Students at Merkinch Primary School in Inverness can now only compete in mixed races.The decision comes just weeks after new guidelines to improve inclusion for pupils who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex was sent out by the Highland Council.But some parents have raised concerns children could face more bullying by the move - while others said it was a clumsy attempt at addressing the matter of inclusion.Mother-of-two Melissa Watson said: “It was a big talking point for me and my mates.There was a race between five girls and one boy and he came last and all the boys were like ‘Ha ha,, you got beaten by a girl’.In my eyes this opens the kids up to being bullied.“Why doesn’t the school just let the LGBTI children race with the sex that they feel they belong to, instead of making all the kids run mixed races?”Another mum, who did not want to be named, added: The world has gone mad. I feel for the children in 10-15 years.I dread to think what it’s going to be like.”Other critics pointed out races at a competitive level were not mixed.Del McClurg is chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council and her grandchildren attend Merkinch Primary.The official guidelines were produced by LGBT Youth Scotland and tell teachers not to deny or overly question trans childrens choices over gender identity.It advises that if the child does not want to inform their parents or carers of their trans identity it is best to not to disclose information.The report adds that schoolkids as young as three should be supported to explore and express their identity regardless of their age.The document also says parents should not be told if their children are sharing rooms with trans pupils on school trips.She said she had “mixed feelings” about the move.Del added: “I think the school needs to explain this to the parents,” she said.“The Olympics don’t do mixed-gender competition sports.”But the school said they had mostly received praise from parents by the change.Headteacher Judith Kean was unavailable for interview but in a written response she confirmed races were mixed at the sports day held this week and that feedback from parents and children had been positive.Hugh Torrance, director of Leadership, Equality and Active Participation (LEAP) in Sports Scotland, which published the guidelines emailed by Highland Council to all schools, said: “The guidance has come about as a result of LGBTI pupils working together with schools to try and address some particularly difficult issues that pupils have experienced within physical education in particular.“We have suggested that pupils should not be segregated according to sex unless it’s necessary.“The evidence points to there being no differences between the genders when it comes to sport pre-puberty.But the manifesto is not saying that we need to do away with gender segregation completely in sport. That’s not how the world is set up at the moment.”Morgan Cowley, former chairman of the Highland LGBTI forum which campaigns for the fair treatment of all LGBTI people, said: “I think introducing non-gender specific sports days into schools is rather a clumsy way of trying to address the crux of the matter within our schools, which is promoting respect for one another and celebrating difference.“There are undoubtedly more astute ways of doing this and what Merkinch Primary is doing seems to be increasing conflict rather than reducing it.“Trying to promote nongender specific sports into schools at this point in our society’s development, when the whole world celebrates and enjoys gender-specific sport at the highest levels, seems a hard sell.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005058965-e1527844664660.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"netflix menu kate middleton escorts film menu","story":"The gaffe saw the Duchess of Cambridge kissing Prince William on the top half but the bottom half of the image was spliced with a tattooed girl in racy stockings and lace underwear.The snap, posted on Reddit by Big_Miss_Steak_, was meant to advertise documentary The Royals, which features interviews with those close to the family.But it somehow got mixed up with racy film Escorts, which is billed as provocative and steamy by Netflix.The shows synopsis reads: Get an unflinching look at two high-priced call girls who rely on the internet to find clients, and the effects of their lifestyle on their families.The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption: The risqué side of Netflix.

campaign","story":"Bombshell emails reveal the former head of the United Nations Kofi Annan has been covertly lobbying the EU’s chief negotiator about the pro-EU “Best for Britain” campaign.The Ghanaian diplomat — who now heads up a group of ex-international leaders called The Elders — briefed Michel Barnier on the foreign-backed campaign to try stop the UK leaving next year.Last night Brexiteers accused the former UN Secretary General of trying to undermine Theresa May’s exit talks.The Elders were set up in 2007 by ex-Genesis singer Peter Gabriel and Richard Branson and was originally chaired by Nelson Mandela.They claim to ”represent an independent voice, not bound by the interests of any nation, government or institution” in the “shared interests of humanity”.It is made up of ten ex-Presidents like America’s Jimmy Carter and international figures like Mr Annan.In April they sparked controversy by suggesting that Brexit risked bringing violence back to Northern Ireland.But today the role played by Mr Annan in directly reaching out to Brussels behind the scenes is revealed by emails seen by The Sun.Best for Britain is funded by Hungarian American hedge fund billionaire George Soros and is campaigning to stop the UK leaving the EU next year.It is chaired by former Labour minister Mark Malloch Brown — who Kofi Annan suggested Mr Barnier meet with after “kindly raising” the work of the campaign with the top Eurocrat.Lord Malloch Brown then wrote to Mr Barnier in February as “Kofi said you had indicated a willingness to meet.”On Monday Lord Malloch Brown sparked uproar by comparing Brexit to turning a blind eye to Hitler and the Nazis in the 1930s.Best for Britain supporters Chuka Umunna and Andrew Adonis were later granted a private meeting in Brussels — but the Labour peer did not attend one as Mr Barnier stressed how busy he is with the divorce talks.Last night Best for Britain confirmed the role played by Mr Annan, saying: “Mark used to work with Kofi when he was Deputy General Secretary of the UN. Barnier is a mutual acquaintance.”A source added: “Barnier met Best for Britain supporters in recent months.”But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: “This tells you all you need to know about the Best for Britain campaign.“It is nothing to do with Britain, but instead focused on people outside of Britain for the benefit of people outside of Britain.”The Brexiteer added: “It is classically anti-Brexit and it is time for citizens of nowhere and everywhere to stop interfering with British politics.“Stay out of it, and stop trying to overturn the democratic will of the British people.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some women and girls are forced to sell sex to survive, and others are raped in times of conflict and catastrophe growing more frequent due to climate change, the 78-year old Canadian author said at a London conference. Of course, those kind of events give rise to civil unrest, wars, resource wars, battles for water, said the author of the 1985 novel The Handmaid\u0027s Tale. Women under those situations will suffer disproportionately, and their children, she said.   Police bodycam footage reveals what really happened before young mum, 20, was punched in head during beach arrest  Atwood\u0027s popular novel imagines a totalitarian future when fertile women are forced into sexual servitude to repopulate a world facing environmental disaster. It has shot back up the bestseller lists after being made into a popular, award-winning television series. Research has shown that women\u0027s vulnerabilities are exposed during the chaos of cyclones, earthquakes and floods, according to the British think-tank Overseas Development Institute. If there is no civil protection and you don\u0027t have any money, what is the one thing that gets traded, always? In war conditions, rape is used a military tactic, Atwood said at the conference on women and climate change hosted by Invisible Dust, an arts and science organisation.

Such scenarios already have played out in North Africa, the Middle East and South East and South Asia, according to a 2016 report by UNEP and Global Footprint Network. Atwood said she was optimistic for the future but warned that many people have grown complacent about the impacts of climate change.

Leader Marine Le Pen announced at a conference in Lyon that 80.1 per cent of those who took part in a poll approved the change to Rassemblement National, or National Rally. The work of reinvention that we have undertaken continues more than ever, she said hailing what she described as a ‘great strategic, technical and political change.’ This big renovation will continue until December. It’s an emotional moment, and we will relish it. Le Pen, 49, is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 89-year-old founder of the party who is a convicted racist, anti-Semite and Holocaust denier.  He created the FN in 1972 as a populist nationalist movement aimed a fighting immigration and the increasing power of the EU. His daughter has tried to present a softer image of the party as she tries to attract more supporters. She came second in France’s presidential election last year, although the party only has eight MPs. This compares to the party’s heyday under her father, in 1986, when it won 35 seats in Paris’s National Assembly. Mr Le Pen also came second to the conservative Jacques Chirac in the 2002 presidential election. But his daughter has herself been accused of inciting racial hatred, and discriminating against minority religious communities, particularly Jews and Muslims.

And if I was the Secretary of State for Defence, I would be very worried about what this 83-year-old great-great-grandmother is capable of.  After more than 20 years of struggle she got a widow\u0027s war pension after finding proof that her late husband Eric had been irradiated while flying sampling missions during Britain\u0027s nuclear tests.  Eric had piloted a converted Canberra bomber sniff plane through the mushroom cloud of our biggest hydrogen bomb when it was detonated over Christmas Island in the South Pacific. But when he got home he started to have crippling headaches. Shirley told me: One day he was holding his head with tears running down his face. He was in agony. We took him to psychiatrists but they had no idea what was wrong. Twice Shirley found and saved her husband as he tried to commit suicide. The third time, in 1976, he succeeded, slashing his wrists in a wood near their home.  Shirley was told by the MoD all of his medical records during his time at Christmas Island have disappeared. But then she discovered a radiation meter in his cockpit registered a dose of 13 Roentgen - the equivalent of 12,000 dental X-rays. Despite a series of legal hearings in which the MoD claimed Eric must have been mentally unstable because he used to wet the bed as a child, it was enough to win a war pension. But Shirley didn\u0027t stop. After the Freedom of Information Act was passed she applied for further details of Eric\u0027s service. In December 2007 they sent her a single sheet of paper which confirmed his dose of 13R, among the records of 13 other aircrew whose names and doses were blanked out. And three months after that, they sent extra documents as additional information. It contained a bombshell.  There, in black and white, it said: Thus the initial experiment was carried out on personnel flying the secondary sampler. Eric\u0027s plane, codenamed Sniff Two, was the second to enter the cloud. Eric had been subjected to an experiment.   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   At the time veterans were trying to sue the MoD for negligence. Shirley gave their lawyers the documents, but as they had more than a million papers to read it seems to have been lost. A little while ago she came across a copy and sent it on to me, because I\u0027ve been reporting on the veterans\u0027 story for the past 16 years. Like her, I\u0027ve seen a lot of these old documents. This one was about testing the film radiation badges thousands of the veterans were given during the tests, and comparing their readings to the Charlie meter which measured radiation in the cockpit. I read through it, and then I fell off my chair.   Experiment! Blimey! Three paragraphs later: Care was taken to ensure that as little shielding effect as possible was given by the ejector seat and that no equipment of any description shielded the badges. I flicked back. For the test a badge was put behind each crew member\u0027s head, on his two arm rests, and on his seat pan. So when they maximised radiation for the badges, they were maximising exposure of the men. His dose according to the badge in the centre of his chest was 13R, as we already knew. But at the bottom of the page was this:  The dose to his head was the biggest of all - almost 19R. Could it be linked to those headaches? And the specific dose to his testicles was 8.8R. You would need to work in a modern nuclear power station for about 460 years to get the same dose.  Eric has four generations of descendants. More than a third of them have an abnormality - including skull deformities, developmental problems, and extra and missing sets of teeth.  Eric knew he was flying through a mushroom cloud. He was likely aware of people testing these badges. But he wore no extra protection, and his widow is sure he was never told about a risk to his DNA. Shirley said: He never breathed a word about his missions to me, but if anyone had warned him about genetic damage he would never have let us have those children.  In February the chairman of the British Nuclear Test Veterans\u0027 Association, Alan Owen, told me four vets were returning to Christmas Island for the 60th anniversary of Grapple Y in April, and launching a medal campaign. Mirror editor Alison Philips agreed to back it, and when a friend introduced me to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson I asked him to do the same. As a former defence minister he knew of the issue, and had even tried to fix it by finding the scientific missing link the MoD had always demanded. It requires scientific method that, geneticists say, has yet to be discovered.  But Tom was only in the job six months. Now, as deputy, he has some responsibility to talk about medal-giving, so said he\u0027d throw his weight behind it. Veteran John Ward, 81, agreed to meet Tom in Parliament and talk to him about his experiences and his belief that they are to blame for his daughter Denise\u0027s extensive medical problems.   And then, with the greatest of pleasure, I rang the MoD. I\u0027ve rung them for comments a lot over the years. I usually have to explain to the press officer what nuclear veterans are before I explain the story. We\u0027ve got a document from 1958 which says personnel were used in a radiation experiment, I said. The only care taken was to ensure they weren\u0027t shielded, and the scientists knew about the possibility of genetic damage. We\u0027re running it tomorrow.  I emailed them the document. That was 9am on Tuesday morning. Over the course of the day the press office claimed the papers were just safety regulations, that it was an experiment on badges not men, and that policy documents say all kinds of stuff so it wasn\u0027t to be believed. I pointed out, repeatedly, a pilot\u0027s radiation exposure was maximised despite official awareness he might have genetic damage, and this was no blue-sky policy idea but a scientific endeavour that actually happened. An official comment landed in my inbox at 6pm. It said veterans were welcome to apply for compensation and added: At the time the military monitored the health of our service personnel and it is no surprise that selected quotes from historical documents refer to this.   1. The MoD has spent more than 30 years fighting every compensation and war pension claim brought by the veterans, at a cost to the public purse of more than \u0026pound17m 2. Monitoring their health? Really? The Mirror decided to hold the story until the next day, in the hope of a comment that actually addressed the story. At 9am, I rang the MoD again. I pointed out the word monitor did not appear in the document once, while the word experiment featured prominently. Off we went again. The press officer claimed this was evidence of keeping the men safe, and I pointed out Eric had zero protection while flying through a cloud produced by a bomb 100 times more powerful than that which levelled Hiroshima. The press officer went home, another started the evening shift, and a comment finally appeared at 8.30pm.  It said: It is not true to say that these men were subject to an experiment to look at the effects of radiation.   I didn\u0027t say it was. I said Eric was USED in an experiment involving radiation - like he was a Bunsen burner, rather than a man. I note you don\u0027t deny it.   The British nuclear testing programme contributed towards keeping our country secure during the Cold War and regular health checks were conducted throughout.  Where are the rest of Eric\u0027s records, then? You told Shirley you don\u0027t have any.      “The National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link participation in this programme to ill health.”   There\u0027s plenty of circumstantial evidence: studies have found 1 in 3 veterans had bone cancer or leukaemia, 3 times the normal rate of miscarriage, 10 times the usual number of birth defects, and elevated rates of infant death. And in 2011 a survey by THE MOD ITSELF found 83% of veterans had up to 10 different health conditions. It\u0027s just the MoD considers this evidence invalid.    We published the story on our front page on Thursday. Tom Watson went on Sky News to demand the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson apologise to Shirley, and reveal how many other nuclear veterans were involved in experiments. I did interviews on LBC, British Forces radio and Forces TV.   These are some of the messages I have had since from veterans and their families: I had five sons after Christmas Island, they\u0027re all disabled my nephew died aged 7 from leukaemia and my sister has an illness doctors cannot diagnose my dad was at Grapple and I have extra teeth too. And these, about the Mirror\u0027s splash yesterday: About to go and buy the Mirror, I wish my dad could have seen this. And: The front page! I was crying as I took it out of the stand. Dad died in 1983, still a young man, never knew his grandchildren. Best of all, though, was a phone call from Shirley. Thank you, darling. You\u0027ve done Eric proud, and told his story so well, she said. Now, what can I do to help you next?  And that\u0027s the bit Gavin Williamson should worry about. What will we do next?

Under the plan, Northern Ireland could be given joint EU and UK status and a buffer zone on its border with the Republic. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake dismissed the plan as being like something out of Alice in Wonderland”. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign against a hard Brexit, said: If there was an award for coming up with unnecessarily complicated and convoluted solutions to self-inflicted problems, David Davis would win it every year.” Jeremy Corbyn already faces firm opposition from the centre-right of his party over Brexit, with a string of moderate MPs backing a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal.  Last night, a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour members from across the party spectrum, signed a joint letter calling for an option to remain in the EU to be included in parliament’s meaningful vote on the terms of Theresa May’s divorce deal. The letter, organised by campaign group Best for Britain, was signed by a string of prominent Labour MPs including David Lammy, Tulip Siddiq, Wes Streeting, Mike Games and Neil Coyle. And the Labour leader (FRI) faces fresh pressure from the party’s left wing, as a prominent union leader urged him to “come clean with the electorate [and] say the Brexit squeeze ain’t worth the juice.” Manuel Cortes, boss of the transport union TSSA, warned Brexit would leave Labour’s working class supporters worse off.

He told Mr Lewis You can use me, use me as the money expert launched into an animated explanation of the perils of door step lending.

Dashcam video captured the terrifying incident as it unfolded in a busy south London street. Dramatic footage shows a a blue Volkswagen pulling out from a queue of traffic and appearing to almost hit the cyclist. The Volkswagen hits an oncoming vehicle and the cyclist pulls out a massive blade, using it to try and smash the car\u0027s front window, the Croydon Advertiser reports. The driver runs off and ditches his car after the cyclist tries to open a locked door.  Police were alerted and are now trying to trace the man who was wielding the knife. Stunned rush hour commuters looked on as the cyclist attacked the car in London Road in Croydon at about 5pm on Wednesday. In the footage a man on a bicycle can be seen to stop next to the stationary Volkswagen.

The man on the bicycle then pulls out a huge knife and uses it to try and smash the driver\u0027s front window.  He then attempts to get into the vehicle via one of the passenger doors, but finds it is locked. The knife-wielding man then makes his way over to the other side of the car. At this point the driver gets out of the car and makes off on foot.  A Met Police spokeswoman said no one has been arrested in connection with the incident.

Martin Sampson, 41, of Brockenhurst, in the New Forest, Hampshire, said it was \u0027incredible\u0027 when a pregnant mother, along with six other donkeys, arrived on his drive. The pregnant donkey known as \u0027Jenny\u0027 went into labour outside his home and had given birth to her foal next to his car within 30 minutes.

Mr Sampson said: It was my five-year-old daughter Ellie who spotted what was happening at first. She noticed that the donkey was pregnant.  There were five or six other donkies that were hanging around ouside the driveway, as if they were checking it was a safe place to give birth. When we saw that she was going into labour we left some food outside for her for energy. She wasn\u0027t in any pain at all during the birth. After the birth some of the other donkeys began wailing very loudly. We think they were trying to warn off other animals that there had been a birth here.

Fans have been counting down the minutes and this series is expected to make an even bigger splash than last year. The finale on ITV2 was watched by 3.1 million people but, as this series takes place around the football World Cup, many more could check it out this time. It sounds like an unlikely TV smash, watching singletons looking for love in the sun while you sit in your PJs on the couch, but bosses are pouring money into it. “It is easily our number one show,” controller of ITV digital channels Paul Mortimer says, “so we are investing in it a bit more heavily.” With versions launched in other countries, and fans including Liam Gallagher and Stormzy, here’s what all the fuss is about...  Love Island starts with a 95-minute special at 9pm on Monday on ITV2.   The presenters Caroline Flack will welcome a new generation of islanders and speak to the evicted contestants packing their suitcases and heading home. But Caroline, below, flies in and out of the island throughout the series and arguably the biggest star of the show isn’t even seen on screen. Comedian Iain Stirling is the commentator – think the voice of Big Brother with sass and humour if you’ve not watched before – and he tells us what is going on in each episode with his tongue in his cheek. Iain only sees the footage for each episode at around 2pm and then has just a few hours to write a script filled with trademark gags – and then record it. He’s rightly become a huge star since he started to voice the show. “I’ve tried to see as little as possible,” he said, when asked what he thought of the line-up. “I try and watch as a viewer.”  How it works Every few days the islanders have to couple up, with those not in a couple at risk of being dumped from the island. But it is not just a case of 11 contestants going in and a winning couple at the end – that would be far too simple. Bosses say the path to true love is “littered with surprise bombshell arrivals” meaning by the end of the eight-week run there will have been more than 20 contestants. There will also be unexpected twists and turns like shock evictions, games, dates and bosses meddling. Most of this news is delivered to contestants via text message on one of their phones, often leading to screams of: “I’ve got a text!” And if two people fancy the same person? Bring on battles for affection and lots of gossiping in the garden.  Sex on TV Parents of contestants will want to look away and invest in ear plugs when their precious ones are doing the deed. While the footage of sex is not graphic – most couples go under a duvet - what you hear is often worse. Couples are also given the chance to spend a night in The Hideaway, a private bedroom where they can have some alone time... with the cameras still on. Bosses insist they don’t show anything graphic. “For the record, we don’t show sex on television” said ITV Studios MD Angela Jain. “We show the reaction to sex happening in the villa. “The way we cut it and treat it is part of a normal relationship. We don’t do it for any kind of salacious outcome.”  The contestants A total of 11 contestants will enter the show to begin with, all single and looking to mingle. They will then “couple up”, leaving one person the odd one out. The line-up includes a West End performer, personal trainer Adam Collard, model Hayley Hughes, an A\u0026ampE doctor and the daughter of EastEnders hardman Danny Dyer. The majority of the five women entering have had their hearts broken in the past 12 months and all of them hope they will finally find “the one” on the TV show where they have up to eight weeks to date. More than 100,000 people applied to go on the show this year but many of the contestants are offered up by agents or scouted from their social media profiles.  Bosses started with a “shortlist” of 1,000 and execs saw most of these themselves after casting agents narrowed it down. Love Island 2017 was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay, although the couple split months after winning a \u0026pound50,000 prize. Kem and his co-star Chris Hughes, who came third with Olivia Attwood, went on to land a spin-off series and released a top 20 single, earning big money off the back of the success of last summer’s show.  The villa The villa is less than an hour’s drive from Palma airport in Majorca. It is the same one used last year. Camera runs in the garden are hidden in huts either side of an infinity pool and LEDs which can change colour are all around the garden floor. Executive producer Tom Gould said: “The sun deck is different and has changed in a new re-imagined space and there is a swing seat. “It makes it more attractive for them and it’s better for us to film. The hideaway has had its annual makeover. And the bedroom. “There is an inside-out theme, too. We have grass on the walls inside. And that new design has been picked up in the bedroom and lounge, to tie the whole thing as one. “On the walls and by the beds there are phrases and stuff that have been said before like ‘You OK, Hun?’ and now have a life of their own...” A smoking area has also had to be created after there were complaints last year.  Paul Mortimer says: “Because they’re a very sexy cast in a  sexy environment on a sexy channel then it made smoking look glamorous.  “Ofcom took a view that it was unacceptable. It’s not against the law to smoke cigarettes but this year we have in plan a place for the smoking area to be outside the villa rather than inside.”   The lingo  The show is well known for introducing a range of words into the nation’s vocabulary, including...  Grafting Focusing your attention on the boy/girl you want and working to woo them.   Muggy If you are doing something bad or disrespectful.   Melt Acting soppy.   Pied off When you are shot down or basically rejected.   Stick it on Make a move on a boy/girl.   My type on paper A perfect match.

A couple ran the private members\u0027 sex club where punters had to always be naked apart from flip-flops. They have been ordered to hand over more than \u0026pound45,000 as a result of continuing to operate the dungeon despite orders to close it down. Directors of the Kestrel Hydro Spa in green-belt Stanwell Moor, Surrey, Graham Tattershall and Ann Trewren, stood in the dock at Guildford Crown Court yesterday. They had lost numerous appeals against a council enforcement order which said the sex dungeon was inappropriate to the area. The nudist colony was run for more than 10 years and featured a swimming pool, a sauna, a sex dungeon.  Tattershall and Trewen were ordered to pay back \u0026pound22,500 each and were also told they will be sentenced for ignoring the council enforcement orders at a future date. Tattershall, aged 65 years, was director of the spa and 54-year-old Trewen was his business partner. The spa ran into legal issues when Spelthorne Borough Council received complaints from neighbours about the previously domestic property being used as a sex club. The council maintained that due to the green-belt location of the club and the lack of a licence to be used as an adult members club, all structures put up should be removed and trading should stop. Tattershall embarked on a three year legal battle and the case was heard all the way up to the Court of Appeal in London, but in 2016 he was told he had to dismantle the outbuildings and hard-standings and stop using the sordid use of the land. However the pair continued to run the club despite being given a year to cease operations and were ordered to pay back the money they had made in this time at a hearing at Guildford Crown Court.

I’m much more independent, much more able, I’m standing, I’m walking, I’m talking.” The crazed attackers, who had mown down pedestrians with a van on London Bridge, stabbed the British Transport Police officer in the head, leg and hand. Wayne, 39, thought he was about to die.  But after a year of \u0026shytreatment he spoke of his hopes to get back to work in July – despite family fears for his safety. He said in a video interview recorded by British Transport Police: “It’s a job I enjoy. It’s who I am, to be honest.” The first officer on the scene, he was temporarily blinded in one eye as Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba knifed him.  The maniacs were eventually shot dead by police. But their attack, on June 3, left eight dead and 48 hurt. Wayne, still in rehabilitation, is working on building up the strength in his left side and \u0026shyrecovering his \u0026shy\u0026shyrunning ability.

And the organ had moved so far out of place Anna Curtis could feel it in the shower. Gym bunny Anna worked out throughout her pregnancy with daughter Lauren, now four, but after giving birth, she began leaking” every time she exercised. It made her job as a post-natal personal trainer nigh on impossible. At first, Anna, of Epsom, Surrey, thought her body was simply recovering from childbirth. The 39-year-old said: After my first gym class following Lauren’s birth, I leaked a little but thought it was just part and parcel of what my body had been through. “But it continued until the point where it wasn’t just when I exercised. At times, I’d be left very distressed when I leaked through my clothes.  When her symptoms worsened over the course of 18 months, she eventually discovered that her bladder had prolapsed – when one or more of the organs in the pelvis slip out of place. “I’d known all along that was the case, she said of the prolapse diagnosis. I had this awful feeling of heaviness and I could literally feel it in the shower.” During her textbook pregnancy with Lauren, Anna, whose husband, Michael Curtis, 42, is a network engineer, even continued to run and lift weights “right up to the birth.” Then, after delivering Lauren naturally at Epsom General Hospital in July 2013, she began experiencing an odd heavy feeling in the pit of her stomach. Initially, she thought it was just her body recovering, but then, eight weeks later, she went to a mother and baby fitness class, only for her bladder to leak afterwards.  “At the time, I wasn’t a post-natal personal trainer, so I didn’t know the dos and don’t of exercising after childbirth,” said Anna. “I’ve always been very fit, so I threw myself into it. “I almost felt I had something to prove. “For many women, the pressure to bounce back, lose that baby weight and be back in your size eight jeans comes from magazines and celebrities, but in my case, it came from within. “Fitness has always been a passion of mine. I enjoy it. It reduces stress and it’s my way of being there for myself.” Cautious, Anna consulted her GP for advice, but said she did not get many answers at first. She added: “Everyone thought it was just my body recovering, so I felt like I had to get on with things.” When Lauren was five months old, Anna started leading fitness classes. The exercise itself was no problem but, working out most days, her urinary incontinence worsened to the point where she struggled to teach. She had to wear pads almost around the clock – even then having accidents, when urine would leak through her clothes. For 18 long months, she was left feeling “upset and embarrassed” about her problem.  Then a urologist, diagnosed her prolapse which, according to the NHS, happens when one or more of the organs in the pelvis slip from their normal position and bulge into the vagina. While not life-threatening, it can be incredibly uncomfortable, and symptoms include a feeling of heaviness in the tummy, feeling or seeing a lump or bulge, problems with weeing and discomfort during sex. On top of this, Anna also has diastasis - where the two muscles running down the middle of her stomach separated – meaning she still looked pregnant months after giving birth. Thankfully, both conditions improved after she began working with pelvic floor physiotherapist Emma Brockwell, having sessions once a month. “The prolapse is something I’ll have to stay on top of my whole life, but the physio has helped enormously,” said Anna, whose experiences have inspired her to start mother baby fitness classes called Team Mama. “In lots of countries, women are given pelvic floor physio as standard after giving birth, but here, I felt I had to really fight for it.” Though her prolapse has remained stable and urinary incontinence has improved, Anna’s diastasis sadly worsened when she gave birth to her second child, Mattie, in August 2017. Admitting that she had been nervous about getting pregnant again, she continued: “Everything had come together quite well, thanks to the physio, then after Mattie it came back hugely.

A 20-year-old woman is in a critical condition today when the crash occurred as crowds gathered to watch a \u0027car meet\u0027, police confirmed. A witness claims more than 100 people were on the pavement watching cars ‘drift’ around the roundabout – known in as ‘Magic Roundabout’ - in Trafford Park when a vehicle careered into them. A 23-year-old man was taken to hospital with \u0027minor\u0027 injuries and has since been released. A man has been arrested following the crash, on Europa Way at around 9.50pm on Thursday night.  The driver failed to stop, police said. A blue BMW 330D believed to have been involved in the collision was later found in neighbouring Salford. This morning a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision. This afternoon, a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.  North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said those injured were in their 20s and 30s and they were taken to Salford Royal Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary. Car meets are often held at Trafford Park. Jamie Brown, 23, was standing nearby when the crash happened and ran to help those injured. Jamie, from Radcliffe told the Manchester Evening News: “There was well over 100 people there, probably about five to 10 cars taking part. “People were drifting around the roundabout.  “I was stood where the crash happened literally about a minute before, then my mate said let’s go back to the car and go. “As we got to the car I heard a huge bang and turned around and saw what had happened. “People were screaming, it was chaotic. I ran over to see what was going on. It was horrific.” There is no evidence to suggest that this is terrorism related at this stage. GMP’s Chief Superintendent Wayne Miller, said: “The men we arrested remain in custody and we continue to question them as part of our investigation.

Lewis Massie, 20, was giving evidence at the trial of Dean Reynolds, who is accused of killing Michael “Mikey” McLean, 17, at Denholm MacNamee, Aberdeenshire. Lewis had been working with Mikey and Reynolds, 23, in the paint tent on August 14, 2015, but left before the incident. He told the High Court in Aberdeen Mikey had gone inside a giant spooler drum - – a large machine used to lower cables into the sea from oil platforms - they were refurbishing to start painting it. Reynolds is alleged to have operated the machine at while Michael was inside the drum of the spooler. Richard Goddard, prosecuting, asked Lewis, of Keith, Banffshire, if there were any plans to “carry out pranks for Mikey on his last day”. Lewis said he wasn’t aware of any, adding: “Dean isn’t really a practical joker.”  On the first day of the trial on Wednesday, a witness told of the moment he came across the injured schoolboy. Brian Ritchie, managing director of Denholm MacNamee, said he rushed to the scene after a staff member told him Michael McLean, 17, was “unconscious”. Brian, 49, said: “I thought he was dead. He was blueish-white and bleeding from the ear.” Earlier, Dean Reynolds, who denies the culpable homicide of Michael, told the court that the teenager might have “choked on his chewing gum”. Michael died in hospital six days after sustaining “severe” injuries in the drum of the massive cable spooling machine at the oil industry services firm. The first day of Reynolds’s trial on Wednesday heard that Michael was working at the firm – where his dad was a procurement manager – and was on his last day on Friday August 14, 2015, before he was due to return to school.

But aside from the surreal sight of a North Korean official in the Oval Office to hand it over, the first thing everyone noticed is just how huge it is. The oversized envelope is the sort of thing you\u0027d sooner expect to see at the presentation of a giant fundraising cheque for charity. Both sides obviously relished the photo opportunity, but social media is speculating there may be another reason the letter was so big. One of the most common playground insults levelled at the US president is that his hands are small.   Some online wags are claiming this is why the letter was so large, so that the North Korean leader could enjoy a dig at his North American rival. A little far fetched perhaps, until you remember the insults the two were throwing at each other just a few months ago - from \u0027my nuclear button is bigger than yours\u0027 to \u0027dotards\u0027.   And if that wasn\u0027t bizarre enough, there was the classic Trump moment where he tells reporters the letter was \u0027very nice\u0027 - before immediately admitting he hadn\u0027t actually read it. The White House later stated Trump had in fact bothered to read what is arguably one of the most politically significant pieces of correspondence the presidency has seen in living memory. The letter was handed over during a meeting between the Republican leader and North Korea\u0027s former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol. Afterwards they exchanged smiles and handshakes, patting his arm in a friendly gesture.  Good meeting today. I think it\u0027s a great start, Trump said after conferring for about 90 minutes with Kim. He is the first North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years and who the president called the second most powerful man in North Korea. Trump said he expected an eventual very positive result with North Korea but dampened expectations for a breakthrough in Singapore. We\u0027re not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were, Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. We\u0027re going to start a process. And I told them today, \u0027Take your time, we can go fast, we can go slowly,\u0027 but I think they\u0027d like to see something happen.  Trump said it could take several meetings to reach an agreement, but he was convinced that Kim Jong Un was committed to denuclearization. He\u0027d like to see it happen, Trump said. We\u0027re getting along, so it\u0027s not a question of maximum pressure, Trump said. At some point, hopefully ... for the good of millions of people, a deal will be worked out. Trump said one thing that could come out of the summit is an agreement formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War, which was concluded only with a truce, not a peace treaty.

The 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO - the Holy Grail model - won the Tour de France Automobile in 1964, which is one of the world’s most famous and historic motor races. It is a 174mph road-legal racing car and one of only 36 built between 1962 and 1964. For years the Ferrari has been based in Germany but shown and driven at events around the world. The Ferrari, known as 4153 GT, has now been sold for $70 million - a record-breaking figure for a car.  Leading Ferrari historian Marcel Massini, who described the car as one of the top three or four GTOs in the world, confirmed it had been bought by an American businessman. Mr Massini added he was confident a GTO would be sold for $100 million within five years. During the 1990s, the GTO was restored by Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering.

But James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition specialist at DK Engineering, said: This is without doubt one of the best 250 GTOs in existence in terms of history and originality. Its period competition is very good. It won the Tour de France which is big tick and was fourth overall at Le Mans which was a mega result. It was raced by Ecurie Francorchamps, who are one of the most iconic and famous independent Ferrari teams, it has never had a big accident and it is highly original.

When she arrived at the scene, police told her Liana was dead and had been killed by the family dog.   Police shoot dead rampaging Rottweiler that savaged five people in street as owner watches on and screams  Brenda, 24, was in tears as she spoke to reporters outside the house saying: I am numb right now. She was the best thing to ever happen to me. Nobody wakes up in the morning and says that you\u0027re gonna lose somebody they love. The young woman told of how she dropped Liana to her grandmother\u0027s on mornings where she didn\u0027t go to nursery. The male dog was one of three in the home and was around three or four years old and had been with the family since he was a puppy.

The snaps are of just one of the leader\u0027s homes, which is perhaps not as lavish or palatial as you might expect. The images were reportedly taken by a photographer who joined Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on a trip to the nation yesterday. They show large, well maintained gardens and a black Mercedes parked in the driveway.  The property itself appears to be two storey, with floor to ceiling glass windows at the front and a minimalist design that suits a communist state. The photographs have been released just as there are renewed hopes for the much anticipated Trump-Kim summit. Today, in a complete reversal, the US president said he would go ahead with the meeting on June 12 in Singapore.  Eight days after canceling the unprecedented summit, citing Pyongyang\u0027s open hostility, Trump welcomed North Korea\u0027s former intelligence chief to the White House Oval Office. Afterwards he exchanged smiles and handshakes, patting his arm in a friendly gesture. Good meeting today. I think it\u0027s a great start, Trump said after conferring for about 90 minutes with Kim Yong Chol, who became the first North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years and who the US president called the second powerful man in North Korea.  Trump said he expected an eventual very positive result with North Korea but dampened expectations for a breakthrough in Singapore. We\u0027re not going to go in and sign something on June 12, and we never were, Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. We\u0027re going to start a process. And I told them today, \u0027Take your time, we can go fast, we can go slowly,\u0027 but I think they\u0027d like to see something happen.

CCTV footage shows the gang taking Nong Gift, 21, out of the bar where she had been watching the Champions League final with friends last Saturday in Chanthaburi, Thailand. The cosmetics seller passed out inside the pub - with relatives claiming she had been drugged - and was carried out at 2am and put in the back of a pick-up truck by four men who it\u0027s said claimed they would take her home. But the men - including one who is said to have known her - drove her to a secluded orchard where she was \u0027repeatedly raped\u0027 before being beaten to death.  The gang - Nattaphong Saenkraud, 24, Patti Boonthal, 23, Panya Chan Somdee, 18, and Surasit Jaechim, 24 - are reported to have confessed their involvement to police. On Wednesday they were taken on a crime re-enactment. CCTV shows them - with the help of a female friend of Nong who is said to be the one who thought the group would take her home - carrying her out of the Orbit Pub and putting her into the back of a truck. Police Major General Charn Jitjunjun said: The victim was found dead on the same night. Four men have been arrested and confessed to their part in the crime. The victim was raped by four people and we believe beaten until she died. Her body was found with foam around her mouth, a nose bleed and part of her clothes on the floor.\u0027  A devastated friend who had been with Nong earlier in the evening said she had left her with the group of men because she thought they were her friends. There were also women in the group when she left including the woman who helped to carry Nong into the truck. Airziz Opachat, who left at 1.40am some 30 minutes before her friend passed out, said: I\u0027m sorry. If we knew that last night was the last time we were together. I will take care of you better. I\u0027m sorry I did not take care of you better. Nong had been with three other women while watching the football match but only knew one of them, Airziz Opachat, well, according to local media. They had been on holiday together in the past and socialised regularly, it was reported. The other girls all left earlier in the evening and Airziz said that Nong didn\u0027t seem very drunk. She added: Nong already knew one of the men. She was friendly with everyone. It was normal for her to be out chatting with people.  I thought that she had arrived with these men and was friends with them. Between us we had all drank about half a bottle of whiskey. I woke up in the morning and didn\u0027t see any message from Nong. The only message was from a man that said \u0027your friend is dead\u0027. Nong\u0027s body was found in the fruit processing area. The four men were arrested later on Sunday, May 27, afternoon after police viewed CCTV and tracked them down. During the crime re-enactment the four men were taken to the bar, shown loading a woman into their truck and taken to warehouse at the orchard where the attack happened. One of the group, Surasit Jaechim, the man who knew her, claims he only drove her and the other men to the area where she was killed. All men have been held in custody. Police are now carrying out post mortem examinations on Nong\u0027s body to discover whether she was drugged and the exact cause of her death.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg

October 2017.And now she has been nominated as Nail Technician of the Year at the Scottish Beauty Industry awards which will be announced on June 17.It all started nine years ago when Jennifer undertook a nail technician diploma in Glasgow.Jennifer said: “Beauty was something I was always into and after completing my diploma I did nails part time.“About five years ago I started my own business at home then started renting spaces in salons.”In 2016 Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer but still carried on creating her nail masterpieces from her home when she felt well enough.Thankfully in June 2017 Jennifer was given the all clear and was determined to get back into the beauty industry.“My friend used to have her salon in premises in Blackness Road and when she outgrew the space she told me to take over the lease,” she said.“I decided to go for it and I opened the salon a few weeks ago with an amazing team behind me.“Having been unwell for such a long time I

But they never gave me those minutes on the pitch so I was a bit annoyed at how it ended down there.“It’s just about finding a manager that will put that trust in me.

Hopefully, they can look past that and see the experience. I want to be a help to someone.“I’ve been lucky that I played 12 or 13 years without injury and then a boy has done me in a tackle.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ray mckinnon aims to lure dundee united assistant laurie ellis to morton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon’s first act as Morton manager could be to raid former employers Dundee United for the services of assistant boss Laurie Ellis.Out of work since being sacked by the Tangerines in October, McKinnon has beaten off stiff competition from an impressive list of candidates to be named as Ton boss on Wednesday.And it’s understood he wants to team up with Ellis for a third time.The pair worked together at Raith Rovers for a season and then moved to Tannadice in 2016.Although McKinnon was dismissed with United five points off the top of the Championship, Ellis’s services were retained and he was appointed caretaker manager.During that period he actually led them back to the top of the league and was approached by several senior member of the team who urged him to apply for the manager’s job on a permanent basis.He declined because at this stage of his coaching career he felt he lacked the experience to be in charge of a club the size of United and resumed his duties as No 2 when Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November.Despite big changes to both the playing squad and backroom staff at Tannadice being planned this summer, including the expected appointment of Csaba’s long-time assistant Werner Burger, it’s understood Ellis has been told he’ll continue to have an important role working with the first team.He may, though, find the chance to team up again with his close friend McKinnon very difficult to turn down.United, meanwhile, have appointed a new head of finance in the shape of chartered accountant Iain Ross.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/59fc45c3606dd-846x564.jpg ","title":"ray mckinnon has no regrets over his spell at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon insists he does not have a point to prove to former club Dundee United after taking over at Greenock Morton.The 47-year-old was axed as Tannadice boss back in October with his side five points adrift of eventual Ladbrokes Championship winners St Mirren.But the man who replaced him, Csaba Laszlo, was unable to inspire the Tangerines to better, with his side crashing out of the promotion battle in the play-off semi-finals.But McKinnon insists his only motivation for taking up his new role at Cappielow is to guide Ton to the Premiership.McKinnon \u0026#8211 who has been handed a one-year rolling deal by chairman Crawford Rae \u0026#8211 said: \u0026#8220After six months out I was getting extremely bored \u0026#8211 there is only so much you can do in the house.\u0026#8220But I\u0026#8217m delighted to be back.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Anthony O’Connor’s contract with the Dons expired yesterday and midfielder Greg Tansey has two years left on his Dons deal but has been told he is free to move on this summer.The Reds made a bid to sign Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch, currently with Scotland in Mexico.Aberdeen offered to make McGeough the highest paid player at the club but Hibs also pitched in with an improved new contract.McGeouch is also being tracked by Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Brentford. New Rangers boss Steven Gerrard is also reportedly weighing up a move for McGeouch.McInnes has already landed 18-year-old Hamilton midfielder Lewis Ferguson on a pre-contract agreement.The Dons boss is also keen on securing Ross County full-back Jason Naismith. Burton Albion and Plymouth Argyle are also interested in Naismith, 23, who has two years left on his Staggies deal and would require a fee.McInnes said: “I’m excited we have good young ones coming through to add to the good players we already have.“But I do think we need more tried and tested players with that level of experience in key positions.”Meanwhile, Dons skipper Graeme Shinnie is in line to start for Scotland against Mexico on Sunday (1am).The Scots will face the World Cup-bound Mexicans at the 87,000 sell-out Azteca Stadium.Shinnie earned a debut cap as a substitute in Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat to Peru in Lima.Scotland boss Alex McLeish said: “We will need to make changes as there is no way the other guys can recover in time. You could see we were flagging.“We have to be hard to beat but we’d like to have a bigger threat at the other end.“It’s not an easy task to bring in guys who people might argue you wouldn’t normally see play for Scotland.“I am so proud of them and am looking forward to seeing the new ones coming in for the Mexico game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.
