I like to think I\u0027m quite handy!\u0027I joined a DIY group on Facebook where I got lots of inspiration from people who were literally just giving cupboards a lick of paint, and it changed the whole room, so I thought I\u0027d give it a go myself.\u0027I also enjoy going around show homes and getting inspiration, and I referred to lots of pictures before I went to Wilkos to get some paint.\u0027With a little painting help from Will and Artie, it took me about six half-days to complete.\u0027During half term last week, Mrs Water\u0027s town was completely cut off, with schools and shops shutting down due to the floods - but luckily her home in particular is situated further from the River Severn, which has burst its banks from heavy downpour.The roads have since been shut off, causing deadlock traffic and her usual ten-minute journey from work now takes 45 minutes.After gutting and cleaning the kitchen to create a fresh canvas, she first took all the cupboards off and sanded them down ready for paint, as before they had a high-gloss finish.She then used sugar soap to rid the cupboards of a thick yellow layer of nicotine, as the previous owner was a smoker, and painted them all with a pot of grey paint from Wilko, costing £12.Mrs Waters bought all the new cupboard handles for just £18 on eBay, and screwed them to each of the ten cupboards and drawers after the paint had dried.To whitewash the once yellow tinged walls and tiles, she used a tin of £8 paint from Wilko, and some white wood paint for the kitchen window.The tiled area around the cooker was created with a £10 roll of vinyl from B\u0026ampQ, which she also used to wrap recycled shelves from the original kitchen.But her main task was finding a use for a particularly strange built-in cupboard, which is placed inside the wall across from the main kitchen units.         ‹ Slide me ›    A little bit of imagination also allowed Mrs Waters to transform this under-used alcove   Mrs Waters said: \u0027There\u0027s a cupboard where the old boiler vent used to be, no one could figure out what it was for when we moved in.\u0027It\u0027s the reason why the professional quotes were so high because if we had it knocked down there would need to be a strong structure put in place to brace the ceiling.\u0027So I just thought, why don\u0027t we turn it into a kitchen cupboard?\u0027I sanded and painted the inside, whitewashed the brick effect wall and added two shelves inside which cost £20 - it now stores all our pots on and pans.\u0027Recycling old stuff from your house is easier to do than you think!\u0027Overall, she spent just £68 on the transformation, and has received rave reviews from her family and others online, after posting it on Facebook.She added: \u0027I did a big reveal of the kitchen for my mum and she was gobsmacked.\u0027I can\u0027t believe how popular the Facebook post became -

Drax’s journey away from coal began some years ago and I’m proud to say we’re going to finish the job well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline.”He said ending coal burning was “the right decision for our business, our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees, which will be difficult for them and their families”.Drax claims to be Europe’s largest decarbonisation project after decades as Britain’s most polluting power plant since it began producing electricity in the 1970s.The power giant is in the process of replacing coal with wood waste pellets – or biomass – and developing carbon capture technology to trap pollution from its flues before it can contribute to global heating.Environmental campaigners have protested against the company’s plans to replace two coal-fired power units with gas-fired units and build a further two gas-fired units on the same site because of fears that the projects will lock the UK into long-term use of fossil fuels.Some green groups have raised questions over whether burning biomass is a sustainable energy source and whether it should be considered “renewable”, despite reports from the company, which it says proves that its US wood pellets are sustainably sourced.Drax earns an estimated £2.1m a day from renewable energy subsidies for its biomass units and has managed to reduce the cost of its biomass. The company reported adjusted earnings of £410m for 2019, up from £250m the year before.Gardiner said by using “sustainable biomass” Drax had “not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK’s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccb593eb63234c001056e6b03b3e7d0534a44804/0_0_5510_3306/master/5510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd2b4e0843aefa1806a844739eb203d6","title":"world bank guyana fossil fuel industry climate","story":"Campaigners say move is ‘blatant contradiction’ of lender’s climate commitmentsThe World Bank has been criticised for providing $55m (£43m) to aid fossil fuel extraction in Guyana, at the same time that it has pledged to stop direct funding of oil and gas production.The Washington-based institution, which provides loans and grants to aid the development of poorer countries, will provide $20m to pay for the training of Guyanese oil and gas officials, including those involved in the marketing of oil.It will also provide $35m to revamp the banking and insurance sectors in the country, in anticipation of the influx of billions of dollars of oil money from new oilfields.The World Bank gained plaudits from environmental groups in 2017 when it pledged to “no longer finance upstream oil and gas” after 2019.However, the pledge allowed it to finance the strengthening of governance and regulation in poorer countries, in the hope of avoiding the so-called resource curse in which oil wealth brings corruption and misuse of money.Campaigners said the World Bank’s focus on the oil and gas sectors clashed with its commitments “to help countries accelerate the transition to sustainable energy” and to support the 2015 Paris agreement goal of keeping global temperature increases to below 2C.“The World Bank’s public assistance to upstream oil development in Guyana is a blatant contradiction to Guyana’s climate change priorities and the bank’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement,” said Heike Mainhardt, a senior advisor at Urgewald, a German non-governmental organisation that has tracked the projects. “I am perplexed by the World Bank’s disregard for its own warning.”Mainhardt said the World Bank’s provision of assistance to the Guyanese government and general budget support allowed it to get around its pledge not to finance upstream oil and gas projects. The country’s rulers were then free to use the money to finance oil development directly, she said.Guyana is expected to become one of the world’s largest oil producers after US firm ExxonMobil, along with the consortium partners Hess and China’s state-owned CNOOC, found sites that could deliver 8bn barrels of oil, including in the offshore Stabroek block.The discovery could prompt massive change for a country of only 800,000 people and less than $5,000 in GDP per person in 2018.The consultancy Rystad Energy this month forecast that Guyana’s oil production could reach 1.2m barrels per day by the end of the decade, lifting total annual oil revenues well above $20bn at current prices.It said government income – projected to be about $270m in 2020 – could reach nearly $10bn annually within a decade, far outstripping Guyana’s 2018 GDP of $3.9bn.Melinda Janki, an international lawyer challenging oil development in Guyana, asked why the World Bank was not funding cheap renewable energy for the country. She said the institution was “pushing Guyana down a financially disastrous development path”.Oil production has become a significant issue in the run-up to Guyana’s election in March, after criticism of the incumbent government run by President David Granger.This month Global Witness, a corruption monitor, said a 40-year deal agreed between the government and ExxonMobil for drilling rights would deprive the country of $55bn. The Guyanese opposition has promised to renegotiate the contracts.A World Bank spokeswoman said: “The World Bank has not provided any financing to develop the Stabroek Block oilfield.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55ce40725047d062315c11ce76a40595b97be64/0_281_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d409263a19d7c4c56ecdb5249baa01d","title":"how did british indians become so prominent in the conservative party","story":"Last week, the “most Indian cabinet” in British history realised a long-standing dream of the Tory right: the introduction of a purposely cruel “points-based” immigration system. Finally, as many were quick to point out, we saw the limits of “representation politics” laid bare – the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the three other British Indians appointed to Johnson’s cabinet will only embolden Tory racism. But there is a more important story to tell here about how the modern Conservative party came to embrace British Indians – one that runs through Nairobi, Harrow East and occupied Kashmir.Indian migration to Britain took place in two significant waves. The first was in the late 1940s and 50s, when migrants were recruited directly from India by successive governments to fill the labour shortage that resulted from the second world war. They mostly settled in the Midlands and the north-west of England, working in foundries and textile manufacturing. These migrants were heavily involved in building Britain’s antiracist and trade union movements in the 1950s and 60s, drawing on lessons learned from anti-colonial struggles back home to organise their communities in Britain. To this day, these communities are disproportionately working class and Labour voting.The second wave of Indian migrants to Britain were the so-called “twice migrants” who arrived from east Africa in the 1960s and 70s, having been expelled or encouraged to leave by the newly independent regimes in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. The families of our chancellor, home secretary and attorney general are all part of this latter group.So how and why have their descendants become so prominent on the Tory frontbenches? The answer begins in 1895, with the creation of the British East Africa Protectorate. British officials envisioned the protectorate, which occupied roughly the same area as modern-day Kenya, as the “America of the Hindu”, a settler-colonial project to be led by Indians on behalf of the British.In the early 20th century, thousands of Indians (mostly Goans, Gujaratis and Punjabis) were imported into east Africa as subcolonial agents of civilisation. They were required to work in colonial administration and serve in the colonial police and army, to keep the “native peoples” in order. At the same time, more than 30,000 indentured labourers were brought over from India to build the Kenya-Uganda railway.When this group of Indians arrived in Britain, many brought with them the considerable wealth they had accrued (along with a hostility towards black Africans). Others brought with them the benefits of English-language education. These advantages virtually guaranteed the economic success of east African Indians in Britain, especially in the retail businesses of Margaret Thatcher’s “enterprise economy”, for which they soon became known. Rishi Sunak’s pharmacist mother and Priti Patel’s newsagent-owning parents were typical of their generation.The Conservative leadership of the time identified this demographic as potential voters. From the 1980s onwards, the Tories began to court an imagined “Indian community”, limited to east African Indians who had settled around London. Successful British Indians were held up as evidence of what could be achieved under a free-market Conservative government. In 1988, Thatcher welcomed the new Indian high commissioner to Britain with the following words: “We so much welcome the resourceful Indian community here in Britain. You have brought the virtues of family, of hard work and of resolve to make a better life … you are displaying splendid qualities of enterprise and initiative, which benefit not just you and your families but the Indian community and indeed the nation as a whole.”The Tories have now managed to extend their appeal beyond the “two time” migrants by finding common cause in a project of Islamophobia. Supported by the Indian government and its far-right ruling party, the BJP, the Conservatives have exploited a sharp rise in Hindu nationalism within the British Indian community to play Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Muslim communities off against one another. Seventy years after India liberated itself from colonial rule, the old colonial tactics of ide and rule continue to govern Indians in the metropole. Overcoming this is not an impossible task. However, the relative ease with which we Indians in Britain have found ourselves in this situation should be of serious concern. That the latest expansion of Britain’s punitive border regime can be drawn up and legitimised by the sons and daughters of migrants reveals the limits of an antiracist discourse that claims a common “lived experience” as the grounds for political action.Our community’s history of antiracist struggle in Britain can show us another way to confront these issues. When Indian migrants first arrived in Britain in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, they joined forces with recently arrived African-Caribbean migrants to form a unified “black” community of resistance. They responded to state neglect, racial violence and racist policing with a range of radical self-help initiatives, run through organisations such as the United Coloured People’s Alliance, the Black Liberation Front and the British Black Panther Movement. This is a story of community and class solidarity based on shared resistance. It should be recovered to prepare us for the fight ahead.• Neha Shah is an activist and researcher at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a061d2df96aa806871a2288d9e0ca00d07f2a08/0_321_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cffd58ee937eec1f4bd2366ef41bf78d","title":"tv debates brexit bbc centre ground leavers remainers","story":"As someone who was behind the camera, briefing presenters and booking guests, it has been interesting to see the BBC’s coverage of current affairs and politics put under scrutiny.Political broadcasts often operate with only a single day’s preparation: issues arise in the news, suitable guests are immediately pitched and briefs are drawn up for presenters. But during the past few years this process has become increasingly haphazard as the number of credible political voices diminished with every passing week. The main reason for this is, of course, the all-pervasive issue of Brexit.Traditionally, Westminster voices in opposition are only too glad to comment on the misdeeds of the incumbent party. But Brexit, especially during Theresa May’s administration, cast a strange spell on party politics. To comment publicly on May’s deal was to implicitly reveal one’s attitude towards Brexit. Very few MPs could afford to alienate one half of the leaveremain ide and even if their constituency might have permitted it, their party whip might not.As such, the task of the political producer – to drum up panels of relevant and interested politicians for public debate – became almost impossible. Broadly speaking, there were only two types of guests for producers to choose from: Brexiteer evangelists or slick and power-hungry London remainers. That the discussion surrounding Brexit should be conducted from these two extremes has become accepted as a sort of national truth, but it certainly doesn’t reflect the real make-up of parliament or the country.A large portion of blame for this disappearing act falls at the feet of the politicians, who effectively empty-chaired themselves. But the BBC played its own anxiety-laden part in the confusion too.Under the leadership of director general Tony Hall there has been a commendable focus on balanced viewpoints on all political shows. Gone are the days of all-male panels discussing a crisis at a female refugee detention centre. But the manner in which this ersification was put in place by production staff swiftly descended into farce. A whiteboard would be marked up with a clumsy grid system. The grid would revolve around a set of key identities such as “woman”, “northern” or “poc” (person of colour). These would then be cross-categorised with political stances such as “Brexiteer”, “Tory” or “progressive”. Our task would then be to ensure that any proposed panel contained a complete balance of all these attributes.On daily programmes, where a different panel needed to be booked five days a week, these grid meetings often descended into the sort of charade that certain rightwing columnists dream about. One notable incident came when in order to find an “authentic” northern voice, all plausible interviewees who displayed any obvious erudition were vetoed. In their place, newspaper owner Danny Lockwood was slotted into the identity sudoku, as his tone was seen to more directly signal his real northern identity. Several producers thought fit to mention that said inidual was, in fact, a reactionary whose past achievements include mocking the “Zorro” outfits worn by some Muslim women. But the grids didn’t have any disqualifying categories.Ironically, the main beneficiary of this combination of a grid-based representation and self-imposed Brexit omertà was the European Research Group. High-profile or cabinet politicians can only be reached via power-hungry special advisers and professional press teams. The ERG, on the other hand, has no press agents at all and was very happy to provide the “leave” voice that the grid demands. The sheer number of times Mark Francois was booked over the last year boggles the mind.There is an understandable nervousness about criticising these sorts of editorial practices since it might provide material for the reactionary commentariat who have no desire to see any erse voices in journalism at all. But there is no easy way around the obvious complications caused by this approach. As the grid became the be-all and end-all of programming in some shows, all other ways of thinking about politics went out the window. The sectarian ision of Brexit was taken at face value and guests contributed to a culture of reinforcing this schism rather than trying to understand or interrogate it.It should be noted that this open approach to booking guests does not apply to BBC hiring practices or indeed attitudes towards its own staff. The bulk of its news operations are still dominated by white Oxbridge-educated men of a certain age, and the treatment of young producers and researchers can be questionable at best. One female producer told me that when she reported rape threats shouted at her by far-right activists outside parliament, she was simply told it was “part of her job”.And when we were able to cajole a bigger name on to a show – I’ve been told by several producers that they were instructed to use powers of flirtation more than of negotiation – there was always a boozy familiarity between presenters, writers and MPs that demonstrated the perils of establishment thinking. A handful of MPs, deeply entrenched in London’s literary and intellectual circles, treat the BBC like a university common room. By default these iniduals are remainers. To continue booking them (drinking with them), the production staff must then secure the presence of their leave-voting, far-right opposition. Off-camera, a highly influential Westminster social circle revolves around trips to various holiday homes in continental Europe, where various MPs and the journalists who are supposed to report on them have long been playing just as hard as they work.Work in British politics is hard – and has been doubly so over the last few years – so it is understandable that an embattled solidarity develops between the press and the objects of their scrutiny. Without those parties on the Mediterranean I’m sure that many stories and interviews wouldn’t have materialised. But it is hard to stomach the ceaseless talk of impartial, representative journalism when the content of our shows frequently depends on which London politician fancies a drink after work.The ideas behind Hall’s ersity drive were worthwhile: first, it could be presented as a solution to the establishment liberalism that had so badly failed to predict the conditions that fuelled Brexit at the same time, it was intended to address the historic imbalances of class and race that still mar so much modern political reporting. In the end Hall’s initiative was a solution to neither problem. While the BBC was busy failing to change its structures and work practices with whiteboards, the most complex and unorthodox period of politics in a generation simply blew past – despite the considerable airtime given to it – the one group of people who were most trusted to shine a light on it.• The author is a journalist who has worked for the BBC.

The document aims to address the government’s “levelling up” agenda. It also calls for research funding to be redirected to “left behind” regions and the establishment of a national skills council for England, made up of leaders from colleges, universities and funding agencies, to encourage local collaboration to address skills shortages and educational disadvantage.Rachel Hewitt, Hepi’s director of policy and advocacy, said: “Recent years have shown that some universities are not as closely attuned to their local communities as they thought they were. At the same time they have been subjected to unprecedented levels of policy change by government, which has led to challenging competing priorities. This report provides a road map for universities to get back in touch with the places where they are based.”Meanwhile, the universities regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS), has launched a review of higher education admissions, which could lead to scrapping personal statements and the introduction of post-qualification applications, so students apply to university once they receive their A-level results.Among the areas for consideration is the vastly increased use of unconditional offers, the accuracy of predicted grades, the deployment of incentives by universities trying to market their courses, and the value of using contextual information in admissions for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.One option is to keep the current system with limited reforms to improve fairness. More radically, the OfS is considering a system where students would continue to apply before their exams, but offers would only be made after they received their results, and a third model where students might register their interest in a university but delay their full application until after their results.Sir Michael Barber, chair of the OfS, said: “There is widespread recognition that certain aspects of the current admissions system are not working, and may be especially unfair on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is fundamentally an open consultation and a genuine attempt to seek views from as wide a range of respondents as possible.”The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, said the admissions process should be transparent. “It is clear some practices, such as ‘conditional unconditional offers’, can limit the opportunities and outcomes for some students and changes are needed. The OfS’s admissions review will be instrumental in helping assess how the system can be improved.”The OfS is particularly keen to get the views of past, present and future students, as well as parents, academic staff, higher education leaders, schools and colleges. The consultation ends on 21 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90c6f5305c93c5e2f6cc93af7b97a4f87c7a73ee/0_0_5177_3106/master/5177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5004f3b25a333d594cab1f0d00d2b61","title":"underwater photographer of the year 2020 winners in pictures","story":"All the winning images, all the backstories and all the judges’ comments can be found in the The Underwater Photographer of the Year Yearbook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b831e7595d0753ff77fd79b909513c6e819ef57f/0_0_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b46db8f3ddb64dd45349e0a104b277a9","title":"coffee alone wont transform a former pit town but it can inspire people","story":"A roastery in a coalshed is bringing punters from far and wide to Ammanford in Wales. Such ambition must surely spur on othersI get to travel around the UK a lot, forever celebrating commercial life outside the big cities. On Monday morning, I found encouragement in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire. It was raining hard on this small former pit town. The last of the collieries closed in 2003 and it has been looking for another purpose ever since. Over the road from Lidl and the police station is a place called Coaltown. It is a huge coffee shop, cafe and roastery, so hip that if you came across it in Hoxton in east London or Manchester’s Northern Quarter you would roll your eyes. Here in Ammanford it looked, at first sight, plain incongruous.Scott James founded it. Sporting a bright red knitted beret thing, he wouldn’t look out of place in Hoxton, either. It was Scott who decided that his home town needed, of all things, an enormous, trendy coffee palace. God only knows how he persuaded anyone to agree with him enough to lend him the money to buy a vast derelict coalshed next to the railway and turn it into this unexpected masterpiece. Scott hopes that coffee can take the place of anthracite as the black gold powering the town. He speaks of creating a new industry, training and employing local people in the business. The punters come from far and wide to hang out, eat the food, drink the coffee and smell the beans roasting. It’s a beautiful space.Yes, as a nation, we probably have enough coffee shops. And the best coffee business east of St Davids is not going to turn a town around on its own. But there is something magnificent about the ambition, and where it could lead.

Our panel of writers deliver their verdicts on the MVP, the champions and the new teamsMaybe not, but the dramatic inflation in franchise fees over the past few years attracts only the most ambitious of prospective owners. It’s no coincidence that more recent expansion franchises have raised the bar for the league. GRYou may be able to flip the team in 25 years for $1bn, making it a nice long-term investment, but rich people probably buy sports franchises for their ego or to play a real-life version of Football Manager. So, sure, why not? CMThe teams themselves aren’t worth $325m, at least at expansion, but the share of revenue owners receive from the cash cow that is Soccer United Marketing certainly is. JFIf you’re playing the long-game, yes. The growth of MLS may seem slow, but it’s reasonably consistent. You have to look at the expansion fee as buying an empty plot of land – its value is dictated by what you build on it. KHNo, but a place in Soccer United Marketing, the company owned by MLS owners that also has marketing rights to US Soccer, apparently is. BDDavid Beckham to get so frustrated watching Inter Miami from the stands that he comes out of retirement. OK, so it’s extremely unlikely the 44-year-old will actually play another MLS game, but he will surely don the pink of his new team in a charity match or the like at some point. GRNo one’s stock dropped quicker last year than Fanendo Adi’s. He barely got on the field for Cincinnati and ended up getting in some trouble off the field too. But now that he has been reunited with mentor Caleb Porter in Columbus, Adi will make a surprise return to form and win the starting job over Gyasi Zardes. CMInter Miami will make a deep playoff run, at least into the conference finals. Their roster is a laundry list of strong, long-time MLS players. And they’ve paired these foundational players with the promising Matías Pellegrini and the exceptional Rodolfo Pizarro. JFThierry Henry is one and done as Montreal manager. I liked Henry the player, I like Henry the pundit. As a manager, I’m still skeptical. He may have softened his man-management style, but his squad is top-heavy and when you combine that with the historical instability at Montreal it makes for a bad pairing. KHWith the new collective bargaining agreement opening the door to more spending and charter flights, the latter a solution to the travel that exhausts many teams and players, a couple of big-money teams (Atlanta, Seattle) will make major splashes in the summer transfer market that pay off in the playoffs. BDCristian Pavón. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic gone there will be an onus on the Argentinian to deliver. Javier Hernández’s deeper role means Guillermo Barros Schelotto’s new attacking system, no longer reliant on getting the ball to one man, should suit Pavón. GRPity Martínez, now adjusted to MLS, will lead Atlanta United to the Supporters Shield. He won’t have the goals total that MVP winners usually get, but the Golden Boot will go to his teammate, Josef Martínez, and Pity will be recognized for his role in Atlanta’s dominance. CMCarlos Vela. LAFC look like they’ve only improved the most explosive offense in league history. A second MVP would make Vela only the second repeat winner in MLS, and the first to do so in consecutive seasons. JFIt’s impossible to look past Carlos Vela. I’ll be amazed if he maintains his form from last season (a combined 49 goals and assists), but I still believe he’s the best player in MLS. If he can add an MLS Cup to his collection then we can start talking about the league’s best ever. KHCarlos Vela again. Teammate Diego Rossi is also a contender, but European clubs are going to wave too much cash to ignore. BDInter Miami could find themselves among the playoff contenders in the Eastern Conference purely on the basis of inidual quality. Nashville have instead targeted MLS veterans. That experience should see them avoid a FC Cincinnati-like fate in their expansion season. GRNashville, with a slew of MLS veterans for defensive reinforcement, will avoid the fate of Cincinnati and Minnesota, who hemorrhaged goals in their debut seasons. But Nashville will struggle to score goals. Miami will have a promising attack, but it won’t click and they will be wildly inconsistent, also missing the playoffs. CMNashville will likely struggle, as most expansion teams do, but Miami may put together an Atlanta or LAFC type first season. Their who’s who of reliable veteran MLS players and young and flashy South American signings is a formula that’s worked for new teams before. JFIf I were picking one to make the playoffs, it would be Inter Miami. Across the last decade, FC Cincinnati have the lowest points total of an expansion team during their debut season (24 points), and I think both will do better than that. KHPoorly. Inter Miami have intriguing pieces but won’t be able to fit them together early in the season. Nashville are just tip-toeing their way into the league. BDSlowly overcoming its inferiority complex. CMHow far we have come. KHImproving but not there yet. BDLA Galaxy’s defence is still a cause for concern, but attack is now king in MLS, as proved by the recent success of Atlanta United and LAFC, and the Galaxy should be a much more rounded side this year. New York City FC look remarkably similar to the team that finished top of the Eastern Conference last year. That continuity should serve them well with new manager Ronny Deila capable of taking them to the next level of their development. Galaxy to beat them in the final. GROnce a powerhouse in MLS, it’s time for the LA Galaxy to get back to winning ways, thanks to the arrival of Javier Hernández and a more cohesive Zlatan-less roster. Toronto FC will be back in MLS Cup, because they are so good in the playoffs, but the Galaxy will be more than the sum of their parts and take the title. CMLAFC will beat Atlanta United in the final. They put together the strongest regular season in MLS history last year, but weren’t able to continue their success come playoff time. So how did they respond? By adding even more talent in the form of José Cifuentes and Francisco Ginella. Their backline is still less than optimal, but when you score at the rate they do, it’s hard to be pessimistic. JFI say this because Seattle Sounders like showing the rest of the world that the MLS playoffs are the Thunderdome: only about survival. Joking aside, I think they’ve added dashes of quality to the roster, while the only real loss is Brad Smith going back to Bournemouth. They’ll beat Atlanta United in the final.

And yet even within that irony there are deeper ironies, the suspicion that a great European performance may not actually have been necessary, the suggestion that Pep Guardiola’s true opponent was less the 11 men in different coloured shirts than himself, and the realisation that good as City were, this Real Madrid are deeply ordinary, little more than the memory of a team despite their branding.But who knows what strange process of attrition can undo a team? Who knows what demons may be raised by finding yourself thwarted at every turn by an opponent playing in a way that was entirely unexpected so that you, the most successful team in the competition’s history, end up chugging around fruitlessly at home in front of a crowd that, even at 1-0 up, was audibly restless? Just because Madrid collapsed in the final 17 minutes after Raheem Sterling came on doesn’t mean they necessarily would have been susceptible to him from the off, before Dani Carvajal had been run into the ground by Gabriel Jesus, who produced a supremely disciplined performance on the left before shifting into the middle to equalise then end Sergio Ramos’s tie.Which is not a criticism – or at least not of Guardiola or City. Games are won and lost on many fronts and one of them is within a team or a manager’s own psyche. Guardiola bears the scars of European ties lost to soft goals conceded, often in clutches: to Real Madrid in 2014, to Barcelona in 2015, to Monaco in 2017, to Liverpool in 2018, to Tottenham last season. Just as Alex Ferguson accepted after the defeat by Madrid in the quarter-final in 2000 that it’s not enough to be better than the opponent, you also have to take risk out of the equation as far as possible, so Guardiola did everything to ensure there would be no sudden two- or three-goal blast against his side.And in a sense the formation he adopted represented a reversion to first principles. After his Bayern had lost 4-1 at Wolfsburg in January 2015, Guardiola blamed himself and wrote what he called his bible on a whiteboard in his office. It was a very short bible, containing just three key strictures. He would deploy:This is how you achieve the key aim of post-Cruyffianism, as set out in his 2001 memoir La meva gent, el meu futbol: “to fill the centre of the pitch in order to play having numerical superiority.” Against a 4-3-3, then, unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise, you field a 4-4-2 – even if it’s an unorthodox interpretation of that shape, featuring a centre-forward on the left of midfield and two midfielders playing as false nines.City perhaps lost some counterattacking fluency by fielding Kevin De Bruyne so high and there were a couple of early long balls to nobody, but that supremacy in midfield was achieved and, broadly speaking, City had control, other than a couple of crosses and Isco’s goal, which was the result of three inidual errors – which can be mitigated but never entirely eliminated by the tactical framework.That such care probably wasn’t necessary against such a limited Madrid is neither provable nor, really, City’s issue: win the game, move on, let the opposition worry about their problems. But Madrid really were dreadful, lacking energy or inspiration, even worse than Barcelona had been away to Napoli on Tuesday.In fact other than Bayern and City, none of the superclubs played well in the first legs of their last-16 ties. Liverpool can be expected to improve but there are major problems elsewhere, some to do with transition, some that run far deeper than that. And that really is what is so repellant about the superclub era, even if the money came from the purest of sources and was spent in scrupulous observance of financial fair play regulations: it means clubs such as Madrid and Barcelona can be run staggeringly badly with no real consequence, their wealth and status sustaining them so they can come back for another large slice of the pie the following year.With so many of the giants stuttering, the competition feels unusually open this year. City would have been among the favourites even before Wednesday’s suggestion that they have developed a new edge, a less risky means of playing. This, at last, could be their year. And with the ban looming, that would be the greatest irony of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1b00ef08dbfa0bf2abbebeb6506421e9a04666/0_431_6457_3874/master/6457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b29f3b3653a877ccc7d1095387653081","title":"james newman my last breath uk eurovision entry","story":"With his unremarkable blend of Lewis Capaldi, Mumford \u0026amp Sons and Coldplay, Newman is unlikely to trouble the Republic of Macedonia on the leaderboardOnly a demented optimist doesn’t feel a sense of hopelessness overwhelm them as the UK’s entry for Eurovision 2020 appears. In fairness to James Newman, the feeling overwhelms you before you actually hear My Last Breath.Eurovision was never exactly a source of national pride – not even the most swivel-eyed, sunlit-uplands jingoist would attempt to elicit a surge of nostalgic patriotism by mentioning the Brotherhood of Man wowing the foreigners with Save All Your Kisses for Me – but it’s turned into an annual national humiliation. There’s no point blaming resentment about Brexit: we last won 23 years ago. We haven’t even made the Top 10 since 2009, a minor success that was wiped out the following year when nobody at all voted for the UK’s entry. Our latter-day lot at Eurovision is to end up in the chastening low 20s.Various explanations have been mooted, including conspiracy theories about geographical voting. The truth is that we haven’t sent a memorable song in decades: try and hum the chorus of Joe and Jake’s You’re Not Alone (No 24, 2016), or Michael Rice’s Bigger Than Us (No 26, 2019). The problem is that we don’t really care. For some nations, Eurovision provides the solitary bit of widespread exposure their native pop music gets, which isn’t the case for the UK. Or at least we don’t care until we lose, and then we clamber on the sideboard and start angrily bellowing Rule, Britannia! and shouting that it’s all a fix.Is My Last Breath going to change this? Probably not. It’s a serviceable song that nods to the earnest post-Ed Sheeran acoustic troubadours exemplified by Lewis Capaldi and to the tub-thumping folksiness of Mumford \u0026amp Sons’ debut album the chorus throws in some Coldplay-ish massed “woah-oh”ing. You can see the logic: these artists represent three of Britain’s most successful musical exports of recent years. My Last Breath wouldn’t sound out of place on the Radio 2 playlist – but nor would it stand out on the Radio 2 playlist. The hook is OK, rather than indelible.The main sense of intrigue about My Last Breath comes from the man singing it: Newman has a successful career as a songwriter, having been employed by Jess Glynne, Little Mix and Rudimental. You look at his track record and think: you’re doing pretty well, so why are you doing this? Why would you want to subject yourself to what is almost inevitably going to happen on 16 May in Rotterdam? Do you think this is the song to turn our fortunes around? Or are you possessed of some crazed, masochistic desire to give a succession of brave smiles to camera and half-heartedly wave a little union jack on a stick as Bosnia-Herzegovina give the UK a desultory deux points and we’re left for dust on the leaderboard by the Republic of Macedonia?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb8db35bb5d141414e0699d49ddae994617942f/0_462_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa03b22d2961c05fe7d10c042891ff48","title":"could coronavirus be china chernobyl moment podcast","story":"The coronavirus crisis engulfing China is the biggest political test yet for Xi Jinping. ’s Lily Kuo looks at how it may become an economic crisis.

Scientists then amplify genetic material called RNA in the samples and look for sections that match the virus’s RNA. The test takes 24 to 48 hours. Once the result is available it is sent back to the clinician who informs the person whether they tested positive or not.People who have recently returned from any of the northern Italian towns that are under containment should self-isolate, whether or not they have symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, or fever. They should stay at home, inform NHS 111 of their travel details, and await advice for further assessment or testing.There are 10 affected towns in the Lombardy region of Italy, namely Codogno, Castiglione d’Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano, and one in the Veneto region, Vo’ Euganeo. The same guidance goes for any travellers returning from Wuhan city and Hubei province in China, Iran, and Daegu and Cheongdo in South Korea.Schools are issuing specific advice if they suspect pupils may be infected. If you believe your child has contracted the virus through a different route, call NHS 111 for advice.In addition to the areas above, Public Health England has drawn up a list of 14 regions. Travellers returning from these areas should self-isolate if they develop coronavirus symptoms. These are Cambodia, the rest of China, other areas of Italy north of Florence and Pisa, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. People returning home from these parts do not need to self-isolate if they do not have coronavirus symptoms.Travel to most European destinations is unaffected, but this may change as the virus spreads. So far, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to the Italian towns that are in isolation to contain the virus, but has not imposed restrictions on other parts of Europe. The Association of British Insurers has put out information on the implications for travel insurance. If you travel against government advice, you are likely to invalidate your insurance.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Go and enjoy yourself. The only area government advises people to avoid completely because of coronavirus is Hubei, the Chinese province where the virus first emerged. It advises against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China and to the cities of Daegu and Cheongdo in South Korea. Travellers to some parts of Asia may face screening on arrival, and many have imposed restrictions on people who have recently been in China or other affected countries. Officials may deny entry or require people to be quarantined. If you have holiday plans and are concerned about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, talk to your airline or travel company. The situation is moving fast, so for the latest travel guidance see the Public Health England and Foreign and Commonwealth Office websites.People who need to self-isolate should stay at home except when they need medical care. They must avoid work, school, public areas and not use public transport or taxis until told it is safe for them to do so. The person should stay in a separate, well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened. Ideally, they should use a separate bathroom, but if this is not possible, consider a bathroom rota where the isolated person washes and bathes last and then, if they are well enough, cleans the facilities thoroughly. They should use separate towels from others in the household. Everyone should follow basic hygiene rules: wash your hands, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, and put used tissues in the bin immediately.Anyone who fears they have contracted the virus should call NHS 111 as a first port of call. They will assess what you need to do, decide whether you need a test, and if so, where you can go for one. The NHS has begun to pilot home testing for coronavirus in London, so if you have symptoms, you may not need to travel to get tested."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b392e62f58ccd0d7697fdf6aae241c284851397/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6877df32b9e8737022e6de99d9e3df72","title":"australia v bangladesh womens twenty20 world cup live","story":"All rounds lead to the Junction Oval. For Australia, it could not be more clear: they now have to beat New Zealand in their last group game on Monday to guarantee safe passage into the semi-final. The Kiwis play Bangladesh between times (at Melbourne on Saturday), but on the evidence of today, I can’t imagine a world where they lose that. It will set up a blockbuster - a quasi-quarter final - to finish Group A, which will decide who moves to the elimination round with India. I can’t wait to be back with you for that. Thanks for your company today. Bye for now! She was brilliant today, smashing 83 from 56 balls and is now talking to Alan Wilkins at the presentation ceremony. Healy says that they hadn’t been nailing their power play overs well enough so they were determined to really take it on today. They practiced hard in the preparation for this game attacking spin early in an innings, which paid off. “Hopefully we can now maintain the rage.”The comprehensive thrashing is at last complete. The wheels are completely off, three wickets in three balls! Khadiza runs after pushing to cover, Lanning gets the throw to Jonassen... easy as you like. Dear oh dear. The captain is hit on the pad first ball and starts to run as she waits to learn her fate. It is given not out but Kimmince - on as a substitute fielder - has more than enough time to get the throw in from cover to run out out anyway.Jahanara swings hard and misses badly, Jonassen pushing the ball into her middle stump to collect her second wicket. With three deliveries to go, the Queensland spinner must be a decent chance of third scalp.Schutt finishes her spell with a third wicket, ending Fargana’s entertaining hand. She tried to sweep her over midwicket but the top edge went straight into the air. It’s a very basic chance but Healy celebrates because this is the ground where she dropped two chances just like that during a crazy Ashes T20 in November 2017. 18th over: Bangladesh 97-5 (Fargana 35, Fahima 1) Jonassen, the ever reliable. How will Australia set up for the elimination stage of this tournament - which begins with their group game against New Zealand - I wonder? 13 players have turned out across the three group games. I reckon they will want the wrist-spin of Wareham ahead of Strano. What about Kimmince? Is she back for Sutherland or Carey or left out altogether? They’re all good problems to have, of course. Straight down her throat. Rumana sweeps and sweeps hard but it was never in doubt with Wareham, taking the relatively simple chance at deep square leg.17th over: Bangladesh 94-4 (Fargana 33, Rumana 13) Wareham’s chance once again now and Rumana doesn’t mind that, crunching over over mid-off for four! The wagon wheel for tonight, from both teams, will show how effective it has been for batters going down the ground - I’m sure that will be looked at by the teams yet to play at Manuka over the next few days. That’s the direction Fargana goes again to finish, with power after dancing to the pitch, albeit straight to long-off this time.16th over: Bangladesh 86-4 (Fargana 30, Rumana 8) Schutt picked up two wickets in three balls to finish her previous spell at the top of the innings. She’s back now for the death. As Nasser Hussain pointed out on commentary during an earlier match in this tournament, it might not be competitive right now but this is perfect practice for her in terms of nailing her death yorkers for later in the comp. She’s a touch legside for the liking of her captain here but Bangladesh don’t capitalise.15th over: Bangladesh 81-4 (Fargana 29, Rumana 3) Jonassen is back for just her second over, one of the most experienced spinners in the world. So she knows the drill here, around the wicket angled in with a bit of flight, making it as challenging as possible to free the arms without taking a substantial risk in doing so. For what little it is worth, the required rate is up to 22 runs an over - 109 needed in 30 balls.After a nice little run for Bangladesh - this pair bringing up their 50 partnership - Joty fails to time her stroke over cover, the ball landing with Lanning on the circle at point. Earlier in the over, Fargana had a pop at Carey, slapping her over mid-off for another emphatic boundary. The partnership is over but she’s still swinging.13th over: Bangladesh 68-3 (Joty 16, Fargana 23) Lanning throws the ball back to Sutherland, keen to get the full allotment of overs into her all-rounder in this low-intensity setting, I am sure. But she is too full to Fargana, who nails her down the ground with a picture-perfect off-drive for four. That’s a super shot. Sutherland overcompensates with her response, this time too short outside the off-stump, and is cut hard behind point. Mooney saves the boundary with a fantastic e but she is reaching for her right shoulder. We’ll be keeping an eye on that. Fargana goes again to finish, slapping a full ball from her back knee through midwicket for another boundary. The Bangladesh fans love it! 13 from the set their best so far.12th over: Bangladesh 55-3 (Joty 15, Fargana 11) This is morphing into glorified centre-wicket practice for Australia’s bowlers with a win well beyond Bangladesh’s wildest dreams from here. That’s a better over from Wareham for the most part, generating plenty of overspin. They will need her against New Zealand. Oooh, dropped catch? I think so, Healy not quite able to glove Joty’s underedge.11th over: Bangladesh 51-3 (Joty 13, Fargana 10) Shot, Joty. The right-hander brings up Bangladesh’s 50 with a compact pull, timed well enough to beat Perry’s e. I’m not sure her skipper would have enjoyed seeing her superstar going full stretch towards her problematic shoulder but she was straight back on her feet. Of course, as Lottie Edwards points out, that was exactly how she hurt her shoulder so badly during the WBBL season, but you can’t ask a competitor like Perry to hold back.10th over: Bangladesh 45-3 (Joty 8, Fargana 9) Georgia Wareham, one of the stars of the future - and already a World Cup winner - into the attack for the first time in this competition. She’s a fraction short to begin here with her leggies, getting her length right by the end of the over. Just three singles. A familiar end is nigh.9th over: Bangladesh 42-3 (Joty 7, Fargana 7) Two boundaries in a row for Bangladesh, Joty starting Carey’s over with a lovely looking drive for cover for four. The seamer pulls her length back a fraction in response, getting through the rest of the set giving up just a couple of additional singles. 14 an over now needed.8th over: Bangladesh 36-3 (Joty 6, Fargana 2) A second front-foot no-ball of the innings so far, this time Sutherland the culprit. It might not appear like a big problem but it isn’t a habit you want to get into as it can really throw rhythm - especially when playing so often. With the technology in place, should’t the simple (perhaps simplistic) answer should be to move your marker back? Fargana finishes the over with a tidy little pull, fine of the fielder on the circle for four.6th over: Bangladesh 27-3 (Joty 0, Fargana 1) That’s a very nice start from Sutherland. She wasn’t given a chance to bowl against India in the tournament opener, left out against Sri Lanka, but back with a wicket in her first over here.Annabel Sutherland, back into the team tonight, picks up a wicket with a tickle down the legside. She set Sanjida up well with a couple of well-directed inswingers, the No3 having a pop at the shorter ball when it came. But she failed to get on top of the stroke, the ball clipping her glove en route to Healy’s.5th over: Bangladesh 26-2 (Sanjida 3, Joty 0) Dropped catch! Gardner puts down a sitter. Sanjida top-edged high into the night sky and the Australian No3 made a meal of it at deep backward square. Perry is the unlucky bowler but is straight back on the job, completing another frutal set. With her sore shoulder, I wouldn’t be surprised if the superstar bowls her four overs straight out off the top here.Straight through her! The classic Megan Schutt inswinger does the trick, through the gate and into the middle stump. After a slow start to this tournament, the South Australian is back in town in a hurry with two wickets in three balls. The punchy opener tried to take Schutt downtown but didn’t get enough of it, safely taken by the experienced Jess Jonassen on the long-on rope. 3rd over: Bangladesh 15-0 (Sultana 9, Murshida 4) Perry oversteps! So assessed by the third umpire. This wouldn’t normally be noteworthy but this is the first ICC tournament where the TV official has had control over the front line rather than the umpires in the middle. It means a free hit, which Murshida doesn’t take advantage of - indeed, it is caught by Haynes at backward point, but she can’t be out on a free hit. Sultana finishes the over in style, cobbering the quick straight back over her head for four! We saw Healy and Mooney do that time and again - a relatively safe strategy on such a true wicket, especially with the field up.2nd over: Bangladesh 7-0 (Sultana 4, Murshida 2) Schutt is the top-billed T20 bowler in the world but hasn’t had the best start to the tournament, notwithstanding an early wicket against Sri Lanka. She’s able to keep both players quiet through the first five deliveries of this set but gives Sultana something to hit to finish, put away through midwicket for Bangladesh’s first boundary. They’re going to need a lot more of that though: the required run rate is already over 10. 1st over: Bangladesh 2-0 (Sultana 0, Murshida 1) Perry jags an off-cutter at Sultana to begin, ever so close to crashing into her leg stump via the edge. She’s off strike next up via the pad. Murshida is then happy to play the superstar respectfully before clipping a single to midwicket to keep the strike and get off the mark. The players are back on the field. Perry is taking the first over, running in at Sultana to begin Murshida Khatun with her at the other end. PLAY! Just what Australia needed. After getting bowled out against India and finding themselves in strife against Sri Lanka, it was time for the top order to fire and fire they did. Healy raceed to 50 in 26 balls, eventually getting to 83 in 53 balls before holing up, putting on 151 for the first wicket - a record for Australia in this format. Both she and Beth Mooney (81 not out in 58 balls) were superb down the ground. Ash Gardner’s 22 in nine balls at the end was the cream on the cake. Bangladesh’s bowling was too defensive early and their fielding too sloppy when chances did come later on. They now have a near-imposssible task ahead of them. 20th over: Australia 189-1 (Mooney 81, Gardner 22) Jahanara has the daunting task of bowling over number 20 at this pair and she doesn’t start well, giving Mooney enough room to throw her hands at a ball well outside the off-stump, clearing the circle and running away for four. Gardner miscues a couple of times when trying to launch the seamer to Parliament House but doesn’t miss when going along the carpet, slapping a low full toss past the bowlers’ boots for another straight boundary. She misses a crossbat slap to finish the innings, struck on the pad. Jahanara sends it upstairs - nothing lost in that - but DRS shows it to be missing leg stump. 14 off the final over, leaving Bangladesh a huge target of 190. 19th over: Australia 175-1 (Mooney 74, Gardner 16) Shot, Ash. Gardner leans back and hammers the captain Salma through midwicket for four. Stand and deliver. She goes through the posh side next up, the result the same, beating the sweeper to the cover rope! The player of the World T20 Final in 2018, she can be so difficult to bowl at when she has the scoreboard on her side. BIGGER AGAIN to finish, parried over the boundary rope for SIX! It should have been out but nothing is going right for Bangladesh in the field. Akter is the culprit this time at long on.18th over: Australia 159-1 (Mooney 73, Gardner 1) Jahanara is back with her Merv Hughes (to pick but one) angled run-up. Russell Jackson, formerly of this parish (and recently again during the Australian Open) wrote a detailed ode to this approach in 2015. It’s an effective over too, until Mooney gets resourceful, picking the length early to lift cleverly over short fine leg for an eighth boundary, moving into the 70s. There’s still just enoughtime for her to reach three figures here. At last Bangladesh take a catch! After dropping Healy then Mooney earlier in the over, the right-hander is finally taken at backward point. Earlier in the over the wheels looked to be falling off, the 150 partnership raised after the two fluffed chances. But the sliced cut from Healy was safely pouched by Sanjida. 16th over: Australia 142-0 (Healy 82, Mooney 59) DROPPED! Nahida wins an error from Mooney, who miscues high in the air after not quite getting to the pitch on the advance, but it is put down in the deep. Back to Healy, who once again uses her feet, hammering the left-arm tweaker over her head. Oooh, back to back boundaries when an inside edge spits away fine. Nothing wrong with the ball - a very nice comeback delivery - but the outfield is so quick. Into the 80s she goes.As always, Causters is spot on. The treatment of Bangladesh by Australian administrators over the last 20 years has been nothing short of disgraceful.15th over: Australia 129-0 (Healy 72, Mooney 56) This is now the highest opening partnership for Australia in T20Is and they are not done yet, Mooney busting out a reverse sweep to raise her half-century! It’s her sixth boundary, reaching the milestone in 41 deliveries. Rumana finishes her four, taking 030. Bowled nicely.14th over: Australia 119-0 (Healy 70, Mooney 49) Two accurate and effective overs in a row from Bangladesh, Fahima’s legspinners taken for four singles only. With six to go, Australia should still be hunting 200. It is possible (albeit not probable) that Net Run Rate could dictate who goes through with India from this group.13th over: Australia 115-0 (Healy 68, Mooney 47) A big let off there for Beth Mooney! The opener danced for the umpteenth time tonight but, for once, missed the well-flighted delivery. Sultana, behind the stumps, wasn’t able to get the bails off in time. It looked like she was well short of her ground but managed to use the momentum of her fall to slide the bat back just in time. Terribly disappointing for Rumana who earned that - an excellent over in very challenging circumstances. Earlier, I was pleased to hear Isa Guha pull Michael Clarke up for a wee overreach on telly. The former Australian captain stated that people were calling for Alyssa Healy’s head when she struggled in the triseries. Not that I’m inclined to (mis)quote Thatcher but I will here: who are these people? What are their names?12th over: Australia 111-0 (Healy 66, Mooney 45) Fahima gives Healy a full toss to start her second over and it is only going to one place: the boundary. She elects to pop it to square leg, where there is a gap. She spinner recovers well - this is a better over - but the singles continue to come at will with eight coming from it.My man Scott Bailey makes a good point here. From memory, this is what they did in 2018 when Perry - listed at seven in that competition - was elevated against Pakistan to get a proper hit before the semi-final stage. They’re spoilt for choice.11th over: Australia 103-0 (Healy 60, Mooney 43) Shot. Mooney brings up the Australian 100 with a crisp tuck, just square of fine leg, running into the boundary rope. Perfect placement off the seam pace of Jahanara across the lightning fast outfield. The milestone is reached between the pair in just 64 deliveries. 10th over: Australia 96-0 (Healy 58, Mooney 38) Fahima Khatun is the second leggie used, bowling in her cap. I mentioned it in the previous over but the running is so good. “It’s what makes these two so hard to bowl to,” notes Lottie Edwards on commentary. “They turn ones into twos.” And Mooney turns a good delivery into a boundary later in the over, jumping down the track once again before stroking through the line, crashing a lofted drive the sightscreen. Class.9th over: Australia 85-0 (Healy 57, Mooney 28) Another big over, Mooney flaying Rumana from the crease through cover, another powerful boundary. She’s playing second fiddle to Healy on the scorecard but doing everything right - especially between the wickets, they’re routinely turning ones into twos now the field is out.“Hello, Mr Collins.” And to you, Abhijato Sensarma. “I watched the previous match between New Zealand and India. The fact that a 16-year old (Shafali Verma) and a 17-year old (Amelia Kerr) bossed the game boggles the mind, especially mine - I am as oldyoung as the latter myself. Women’s cricket is in safe hands.”I’m really happy that Kerr made it work with the bat on this stage. She’s been sketchy at best in big series and tournaments. What a talent. Had she pulled that off, it would have gone down as one of the great World Cup escapes. With their matchwinners (Devine and Bates) both failing and still nearly getting there, I reckon they’re in a pretty good spot for their huge game against Australia. Much better than last time around in 2018 when India smashed them up before copping Meg Lanning’s side - they were broken. I don’t see it that way here. Should be fun.8th over: Australia 74-0 (Healy 53, Mooney 21) BOOM! Healy smashes Khadija over head for SIX! BOOM! She does it again: two in a row, this time over deep midwicket with a slog sweep over the rope! That takes her to a half-century, in just 26 balls, with seven fours and three sixes. Faultless T20 batting from the Aussie opener. 7th over: Australia 58-0 (Healy 39, Mooney 19) The leggie Rumana is into the attack with the field back and she’s sent down an accurate over, giving the Australian pair nothing. But how well the bowler is going doesn’t matter an awful lot to Healy in this mood, dancing down the track again before slapping the final ball of the set over the bowlers’ head for yet another boundary. By my quick count 42 of Australia’s 58 runs so far have been added via fours and sixes.6th over: Australia 53-0 (Healy 35, Mooney 18) Mooney’s turn to go over the bowlers’ head, taking on the offspinner Khadiza’s second delivery after charging to the pitch of the ball. That’s the way to do it with the field up. She follows it with a quick single, dabbed into the offside. Superb strike rotation. Full disclosure: I’ve been the joint-No1 member of the Beth Mooney Fan Club (with Geoff) since the first WBBL season- thrilled to see her playing so well on this stage. Oh, Healy goes bigger when she dances later in the set, lofting the off-break long and high and over the midwicket rope. She’s going big tonight. 13 off the final power play over. 5th over: Australia 40-0 (Healy 28, Mooney 12) Healy goes again, this time to Nahida, down the track and over cover. That’s a much harder shot than it looks with the ball angling in and turning away. They’re already milking the singles off the spinners to build this base. They could easily be on for 200-odd here. 4th over: Australia 33-0 (Healy 23, Mooney 10) Khatun continues and that’s fine with Healy, depositing the spinner back over her head for a fifth boundary. That’s the shot she played so well and so often on her way to player of the tournament honours during the 2018 World T20 in the Caribbean. She’s already 23 from 15.3rd over: Australia 26-0 (Healy 18, Mooney 8) Nahida is on with her left-arm orthodox, around the wicket and though the umpire in at Healy - an old school approach and I love it. It’s a much straighter over too, angling in at the stumps. West Indies showed the folly of tossing it up wide last night against Pakistan, this batting track is too good for that. It prompts Mooney to use her feet for the first time to take a risk but she nails the execution, up over the circle at cover for four. Of course, the left-hander has an international century to her name at this venue from the Ashes in 2017, one of the best hands I’ve witnessed in women’s cricket.2nd over: Australia 20-0 (Healy 17, Mooney 3) The Bangladesh captain Salma Khatun begins from the Cathedral End with her off-spin and Mooney makes contact through point with an assured cut shot, getting two out to deep point from her first offering before milking another single in that direction. Bangladesh have been too wide of the woodwork so far way too defensive. Healy’s turn and she makes the most of it with a fourth boundary in a hurry, timing the off-spin beautifully through cover. That’s her best shot so far. Australia are off to a flyer. It looks a lovely night in Canberra, the shadows just reaching over the pitch as the sun sets. Expect some gorgrous, colourful shots of the sky during the second innings. By contrast, it has just started snowing at my house in North London. 1st over: Australia 12-0 (Healy 12, Mooney 0) Healy leaps onto a wide delivery first up, smashing Jahanara with authority through cover for four. She repeats the dose two balls later - this time a fraction squarer through point - for four more. It was lost a bit in the post-loss commentary against India that Healy got herself back into form with a brisk half-century after a horror run in the pre-competition series against England and India where she made just 25 runs in five innings. Meanwhile, Healy goes again through the off-side, now carving a boundary behind point. Much as it was with the second shot, this was through the air and not too far from the catcher. It prompts another field change: Bangladesh have three fielders on the circle at point to finish. The end of an eventful first over: 4-0-4-0-4-0. Tidy. The players are on the field. Healy and Mooney are walking to the middle, both out early against Sri Lanka. The speedster Jahanara Alam has the ball in her hand, running in from the Manuka Pool end, her trademark headband in position. PLAY! Anthems out in the middle. I didn’t reflect on Australia batting first. That’s an interesting call given their Plan A in this tournament was to chase with their deep batting reserves. A chance here, on a fresh pitch, to get a few players in form before a quasi-quarter final against New Zealand - provided they win tonight. The view from the magnificent Manuka press box. If you are tuning in from outside of Australia and are interested in learning a bit about the nation’s capital, I can strongly recommend Paul Daley’s farewell on his final night as a resident. I lived there for six years and adore the place, not least the cricket ground.Kimmince and Strano are out for Australia Sutherland and Wareham in. I’m surprised the leggie hasn’t played until now - she was outstanding in the T20s against England last year and in the World T20 Final two years ago. As for Kimmince, I didn’t expect her omission - she was their best bowler against India.Perry is fit to play despite carrying a shoulder niggle. There was some talk she might be rested for tonight but Lanning was pretty clear: her superstar is fine. “It is a new wicket and we feel it is a good batting deck so that gives us a chance to get off to a good start.” Annabel Sutherland and Georgia Wareham are into the Australian XI. Lanning says that she can’t remember who is missing out. Love it.Some pre-game commentary from the camps. Meg Lanning is clear that they aren’t underrating Bangladesh, and that’s the right attitude given their opposition have caused big upsets at World T20s before - notably against India. As for the visitors, they take a fair bit of confidence into this after a solid showing with the ball against India and a halfway decent chase. Now to lift their fielding. At the 2018 competition that was what they did best but it wasn’t the case on Monday. Welcome to the second fixture in this Group A double header, with Australia taking on Bangladesh, the lowest seed in this group. The situaton for the host nation remains just as it did when they turned out to play Sri Lanka on Monday: they have to win every game from here to clear this stage, reach the finals and defend the trophy. That’s the penalty they carry for losing to India on Friday. With India just now getting over the line against the Black Caps, this equation remains.It was far from the most convincing display when they did get off the mark at the Waca, reduced to 103 in pursuit of 123. Enter Rachael Haynes and Meg Lanning, who systematically went about finishing the job after the worrying wobble. There’s no need to panic though: they are the best team in the world for a reason. As for Bangladesh, in their one an only outing so far they gave India a decent shove before falling 18 runs short in their chase of 142. Their plan of attack will be simple: to turn the game, somehow, into a low-scoring scrap. The main issue with that approach is that is rarely the experience at Manuka Oval’s batting paradise.

Nearly five decades on, Lin Hwai-min is a legend in his native country (50,000 people turned out to see one show last year) creating a distinctive style of movement based on classical, modern and Chinese folk dance, meditation, martial arts and even calligraphy.Only at the end of last year did Lin step down as artistic director, aged 72, passing the mantle to choreographer Cheng Tsung-lung, and this programme presents work by both men. Cheng’s 13 Tongues demonstrates beautifully the extraordinary, elemental quality of the Cloud Gate dancers, energy coursing through their butter-soft, titanium-strength bodies, limbs curling like tendrils of smoke.The piece is based on Cheng’s memories of his childhood neighbourhood, its chaotic street life and a local storyteller, Thirteen Tongues. It has the feeling of something both ancient and modern, the black-clad dancers singing folk songs before the appearance of a magical superhero in fluorescent frock. You can only conclude that Thirteen Tongues must have been a swirlingly meandering, tangential storyteller, as the hour-long piece flows and circles and takes random turns (a koi carp enigmatically appears) and never quite arrives.Lin’s Dust is a much more focused, literal performance. Inspired by its score, Shostakovich’s String Quartet No 8 in C minor, a piece written in war-ravaged Dresden, Lin looks in horror at victims of war and persecution, man’s inhumanity to man. Here are the exiles, the wretched, the powerless, faces smeared with dirt. They cower together, they beg and plead, they stumble and crawl along the ground.At one point the dancers kneel in a line and, one by one, they reach up and fall, their bodies fanning out like toppling dominoes. It’s the kind of formation you’d see slickly done in a musical, but here all we see are brief moments of hope immediately extinguished. Dust is a slow, pessimistic slide into the dark, yet Lin often lets the music speak loudest and, caught by a brightly dancing rhythm or unexpectedly sweet violin, it’s possible to find beauty amid the horror."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7150f799f7f3e453aa469db1dfc95f5efc67b5d5/352_692_4661_2798/master/4661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8ebe0080c74332cc51e9b7809458b70","title":"can i move my data to the eu before google shifts it to the us brexit","story":"Post-Brexit, Sean wants to keep his data protected by the EU’s GDPR rather than laxer US privacy lawsGiven Google’s recent announcement about moving UK users’ data to US jurisdiction, what’s the best way to migrate to EU-based services? Can you download+upload or crossload your Gmail to another service? And are we in for the same treatment by Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram et al? SeanLast week Google notified users that “because the UK is leaving the EU, we’ve updated our terms so that a United States-based company, Google LLC, is now your service provider instead of Google Ireland Limited. We’ve also changed our privacy policy to make Google LLC the data controller responsible for your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.”This makes sense. There is no reason why two countries that are not in the EU should store data in an EU country. It would be much better, of course, if Google stored UK data in the UK. However, now we are just one of dozens of small countries, it may be hard to justify the cost.Other online service providers may well make the same decision, after weighing the financial, commercial and legal costs of storing UK users’ data locally.At the moment, it should be a moot point. UK data is covered by the Data Protection Act 2018, which is the UK’s version of the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). One problem is that the UK may lower its data protection and privacy standards to US levels, along with our food and other standards, as part of a US trade deal. Another problem is that even if we maintain EU-level regulations, there is no guarantee that the US will observe them. Given Trump’s actions since taking the US presidency, it is hard to imagine that the situation has improved since Edward Snowden shocked us with his revelations.It is hard to be sure where your data is stored because service providers can and do rent space in other people’s hyperscale data centres. However, as far as I know, only Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft have their own server farms in the UK. Google’s are in Dublin in Ireland, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Facebook’s are in Dublin and Denmark. Microsoft has a site in Dublin, of course, but it also has data centres in London, Durham and Cardiff.As traffic grows, the major online service providers keep opening new data centres to be closer to their customers. However, outside the US and the EU, coverage can be sparse. Google, for example, has only three data centres – in Chile, Singapore and Taiwan – for the whole southern hemisphere. It doesn’t have any in Africa, or in Brazil, China, India, Russia or Japan.Consumers who use Microsoft’s Outlook webmail do not have any control over where their data is stored. As a matter of principle, Microsoft stores it for best performance. Local storage is therefore the most likely option but that could depend on network speeds and whether there is enough local storage available.Again, it should be a moot point. Microsoft has been pushing for higher data protection standards in the US, and it responded to the GDPR by “levelling up”. That is to say, it applies GDPR standards for all users in all countries, even if the local regulations allow lower standards.If you are determined to switch away from Gmail, then Microsoft’s Outlook is an option. Both services offer 15GB of free storage and both will import your old emails, which makes for an easy transition. (Microsoft also offers an extra 5GB of storage in OneDrive, which Google doesn’t.) Both services let you reply from your “old” email address if necessary.However, getting everyone to use a new address takes time and I find Outlook’s infinite scrolling pages and broken searchmove routine a horrible experience in a browser. If you get a significant amount of email, I would only recommend it with a decent mail program such as Microsoft Outlook (the Office program), eM Client, Mailbird or whatever. Fortunately, the smartphone and Windows 10 apps, which provide a different view of your webmail, are fine.You could also consider GMX, the English-language version of the German email service, GMX.net (from Global Mail eXchange). It is a free service that can send encrypted emails and it includes three somewhat primitive office apps. GMX used to have a very limited amount of storage but now offers 65GB – space for “about half a million emails”, the company says. The idea is to use GMX’s Mail Collector to pick up mail from your other accounts and consolidate it in one place.It is a couple of decades since I last used GMX but it was very easy to open an account and it sent emails without any problems.I have mentioned some other alternatives – FastMail and ProtonMail – before. FastMail is a good, independent email service with 247 support at reasonable prices: $3 per month with 2GB of storage and $5 per month with 30GB. While the company is Australian, its servers are in Amsterdam and New York, so your data should be inside the EU. Fastmail encrypts the email on its servers and it supports YubiKey access for extra security.ProtonMail is an encrypted GDPR-compliant privacy-focused email service based in Switzerland, which has high data protection standards. Its free service only offers 0.5GB of storage, which isn’t viable for many users. Its Plus plan with 5GB of storage costs €5 per month or €48 per year.You cannot do anything about where Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram et al store your data. These are all proprietary services and they can do whatever they like. If you do not want them to store your data in the US, you will have to download whatever you need (if that’s possible) then delete your accounts.The same thing is true of most business services until they have grown big enough to start opening data centres overseas, such as Adobe.However, you do have a choice of online storage services or “cloud drives”, where the technologies are basically interchangeable. I covered some of these services in an earlier answer: Where’s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?If you fancy the Swiss option, pCloud will store 500GB of data for £47.88 per year or 2TB for £95.88 per year. It will also store 2TB for a lifetime for a one-off payment of £350. The assumption is that disk space will keep getting cheaper until the cost of storing 2TB is irrelevant.Have you got a question?

The main room is big enough to house major artists: all-standing crowds or fully seated ones, or a combination. Whoever is playing, expect the sound quality to be superb. Tokens are needed to purchase drinks, although the side-bar in the street around the corner is cash-friendly. There’s the AB Club upstairs, for smaller draws, and also the intimate AB Salon (above the side-bar) that regularly presents free electronic or experimental gigs. One week in October included AB shows by Australian psych-rockers King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard, German ambient keyboardist Nils Frahm, French-Colombian cumbia extremists Pixvae and Peruvian electronicists Dengue Dengue Dengue. Upcoming acts include Acid Arab, Moses Boyd, King Krule, and Kelis.• Boulevard Anspach 110, abconcerts.beBotanique is on the edge of a botanical garden and is out of the city centre, close to the northern train station. The venue is undergoing work but remains open, even incorporating artworks into the renovation. The main room is the 700-capacity Orangerie but the circular arrangement of the smaller Rotonde space is perfect for intimate gigs, such as Aldous Harding last May, with its mixture of standing and seats. Tokens are required at the bar, annoyingly vended by machines. There’s also a cafe bar that overlooks the gardens. Upcoming gigs include Wolves In The Throne Room, Waqwaq Kingdom, Jeffrey Lewis, Cocorosie, Plaid, and Joan As Policewoman. The venue’s annual festival, Le Nuits Botanique, is in May.• Rue Royale 236, botanique.beA rebranding of the Palais Des Beaux-Arts, Bozar opened in 1929 with the acoustically brilliant Henry Le Boeuf Hall at its core. Classical music is important here but this multi-stage complex also loves jazz, global and electronic music. Chicago techno legend Lil Louis played in 2018, so all seats were removed and a tarpaulin laid down so no mess would be made. Among Bozar’s regular weekenders are the Bruselas Flamenco Festival, Afropolitan, and a recent hosting of French electronica fest Nuits Sonores. There are usually several exhibitions running simultaneously in the vast gallery warren, with a Keith Haring retrospective on until 19 April 2020.• Rue Ravenstein 23, bozar.beFlagey looks like a huge art-deco ship and looms over a square, by the side of two small lakes, in the suburb of Ixelles, a short tram ride south of the centre. It’s a former radio studio (from the 1930s), with curvy wooden walls and fixtures, presenting mostly classical music in three different-capacity spaces. Flagey hosted the sold-out Brussels Jazz Festival during January and its Piano Days season dominated February. In the autumn, there were festivals revolving around Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and the 50th anniversary of the German ECM label.• Place Sainte-Croix, flagey.beOpen since 2006, Les Ateliers Claus is in a labyrinthine part of Saint-Gilles, one of the city’s most arty zones, and is a Brussels equivalent of Café Oto in London. The lineup is always erse and inspiring: a few months ago it hosted Japanese noise sculptor Keiji Haino and New York drummervibraphonist Ches Smith, stressing out the decibel meters to a packed crowd. It also promoted veteran prog rock band Magma in a larger venue, used when Claus proves too intimate. This joint has an inviting aura, with a bar beyond the stage that’s a good source of excitingly sour lambic beer. Coming soon: Thurston Moore, Terrie Ex, OOIOO and veteran US electronic composer Carl Stone.• Rue Crickx 15, lesateliersclausSince 2005, the global music promoter Muziekpublique has presented nearly all of its gigs at Théâtre Molière, a quaint old 1960s haunt in Matongé, the mostly Congolese quarter of Brussels. During Brussels Jazz Weekend it presented a night of African acts, topped by Super Rumba, a Zairean (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) soukous group who played in the theatre’s entrance bar. Muziekpubliqe has presented the likes of Baaba Maal, Martin Simpson and Totó La Momposina. In coming weeks, it has enticing players arriving from Ireland, Mali, France and Greece.• Square du Bastion 3, muziekpublique.beNot far from the church of Sainte-Catherine, the Roskam bar would be excellent even if merely pouring beer but every Sunday it hosts one of the best (and most adventurous) jazz sessions in Brussels. Admission is free, which leads to a ide between the concert conditions at the stage end of the room and the lively expression of the bar-end. Roskam seems to have a predilection for low-pitched instrument bandleaders, with Hélène Duret, Grégoire Tirtiaux and Thunderblender’s Sam Comerford making forceful impressions on bass clarinet, baritone and bass saxophones in recent months. These acts might not be well-known outside of Brussels but have the potential to make an impact beyond Belgium.• Rue de Flandre 9, cafe-roskam.beOnly a few steps from the Grand Place, this jazz club has the advantage of pulling in tourists as well as hepcats. It celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2020 and is modelled on the classic New York City club template – but with a relaxed Euro-cafe atmosphere. Food is available, and most of the seating is at tables, although hanging out on a barstool gives a prime view. There’s free admission for the weekly Tuesday jam session – which runs past midnight – and Wednesday’s Carte Blanche sets, which allow a different artist each month to present combinations of invited players. The weekend gigs are ticketed, and tend to sell out, featuring name artists or themed presentations. The emphasis is on mainline jazz but veers into funk, soul, African and Latin.• Rue des Pierres 5, themusicvillageWerkplaats Walter is a roost for the extremes of classical, electronic, jazz, rock and improvisation. It’s almost literally a roost, too, as the audience needs to climb an exterior iron stairway to the venue’s second floor, where they’ll be welcomed into the bar area. Walter vends its own beer, specially brewed for the venue in the village of Gijzegem. In the theatre, there are tiered ledges to the rear, and a large floor space, with a large sculptural mural along the right side, constructed by the Expanded Eye duo from Lisbon, utilising doors and window-frames discarded when the building was being renovated. The venue is in the Anderlecht suburb, and is the brainchild of drummer Teun Verbruggen. Coming up soon are the free jazz of Evan Parker and Slovenian pianist Kaja Draksler.• Rue Van Lint 43, werkplaatswalter.beAcross the side-street from AB’s bar entrance is Bonnefooi, which means “by chance”. A sign on the glass door reads “Can you stop making all that noise outside? People are trying to dance in here!” This is a joint that’s open for partying through the night and into the morning. Inside, the layout is simple: a long, narrow room, with a bar on the right, and a seated mezzanine looking onto the dance area. Free-entry gigs are frequent, ranging from the deep electronic pulsing of Demdike Stare and Paddy Steer to, for instance, an almost-acoustic midweek appearance by Moroccan gnaoua group Black Koyo.• Rue des Pierres 8, bonnefooi.beLooking for a holiday with a difference?

I have zero undergrad debt. Of my three years of grad school, two of them were funded through a teaching fellowship my parents helped pay for the first. The last two years my stipend barely covered the childcare I needed to travel uptown three days a week to teach and go to class and my husband’s job is what kept us afloat.I got connections from that program. I got my agent through the recommendation of a professor. Nearly every year since I graduated from that program, I have been employed by them. The thing I’m most sure I had though, that was a direct result of my extraordinary privilege, is the blindness with which I bounded toward this profession, the not knowing, because I had never felt, until I was a grownup, the very real and bone-deep fear of not knowing how you’ll live from month to month.Other versions of this story that I know from other people: a down payment from a grandpa on a brownstone monthly parental stipends a partner who works at a startup a partner who’s a corporate lawyer a wealthy former boss who got attached and agreed to pay their grad school off.Once, before a debut novelist panel geared specifically to aspiring writers, one of the novelists with whom I was set to speak mentioned to me that they’d hired a private publicist to promote their book. They told me it cost nearly their whole advance but was worth it, they said, because this private publicist got them on a widely watched talkshow. During this panel, this writer mentioned to the crowd at one point that they “wrote and taught exclusively”, and I kept my eyes on my hands folded in my lap. I knew this writer did much of the same teaching I did, gig work, often for between $1,500-$3,000 for a six to eight-week course nowhere near enough to sustain one’s self in New York. I knew their whole advance was gone, and that, if the publicist did pay off, it would be months before they might accrue returns.I did not know what this writer, who I thought was single, paid in rent, or all the other ways that they might have been able to cut corners, that I, a mother of two, could not cut, but even then, it felt impossible to me that this writer was sustaining themselves in any legitimate way without some outside help. I thought, maybe, when they said “write” they might be including copywriting or tech, as some others that I know support themselves.I knew all these aspiring writers, though, heard this person say this and assumed that there was a way to make a living as a writer, that they thought this person was “making it” in ways they hoped one day to be. I don’t know this writer and don’t know how, actually, they lived. What I do know is, when the panel was over, I wanted to take the microphone back and say loudly to the students that what this writer said was, at least in part, a lie.On Instagram and Twitter there are writers who “write full time” also. They post pictures of their desk or their pens and talk about “process”. Maybe, two years ago, they sold a quiet literary novel to an independent press. For my students, for all the people I see out there, trying to break in or through and watching, envious, I want to attach to these statements and these Instagram posts, a caveat that says the writing isn’t what is keeping this person safe and clothed and fed.I would argue that there is nothing more sustaining to long-term creative work than time and space – these things cost money – and the fact that some people have access to it for reasons that are often outside of their control continues to create an ecosystem in which the tenor of the voices that we hear from most often remains similar. It is no wonder, I say often to students, that so much of the canon is about rich white people. Who else, after all, has the time and space to finish a book. Who else, after all, as the book is coming out, has the time and space and money to promote and publicize that book?There are ramifications, I think, of no one mentioning the source of this freedom when they have it. There is the perpetuation of an illusion that makes an unsustainable life choice appear sustainable, that makes the specific achievements of particular iniduals seem more remunerative than they actually are. There is the feeling that the choices that we’ve made outside of writing: who we married, whether or not we had children, the families we were born to, will forever hinder our ability to make good work.When students ask me for advice with regard to how to “make it as a writer”, I tell them to get a job that also gives them time and space somehow to write I tell them find a job that, if they still have it 10 years from now, it wouldn’t make them sad. I worry often that they think this means I don’t think their work is worthy that I don’t believe they’ll make it in the way that they imagine making it, but this advice is me trying help them sustain themselves enough to make the work I know they can.Like most other American systems and professions, delusions around meritocracy continue to pervade the writing world. Those of us who are not bolstered by outside sources, those of us who are but still struggle, and say it out loud, often run the risk of seeming whiny or ungrateful maybe we worry we will just be thought not good enough. To be a writer is a choice, after all, and I continue to make it. But perpetuating the delusion that the choice is not impossibly risky, precarity-inducing, only hurts the participants’ ability to reconsider the various shapes their lives might take in service of sustaining it and them.It allows a system that cannot sustain most of the producers of its products to continue to pretend it can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d19176b2e4f040589fcdbb453eec8130b7da90d/0_1042_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6bc843315adc4f27dc009740d435711","title":"alabama voting rights alfonzo tucker","story":"Alfonzo Tucker Jr is just one millions of Americans who have been entangled in a racially biased system – and deprived of their democratic rightIn 2018, with the midterm elections approaching, Alfonzo Tucker Jr was particularly eager to vote. The mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Tucker’s hometown, was running for governor, and the year before he had canvassed for Doug Jones, a Democrat running in a closely watched US Senate race.But Tucker wasn’t able to cast a ballot – state officials refused to even let him register. It wasn’t until weeks later that he learned why he had been deprived of the right to vote.He owed the state $4.The US is founded on the promise of democracy and fair representation, but it is also the country where minorities are frequently disenfranchised for political gain. Among the most vulnerable are millions of Americans, disproportionately African Americans, like Tucker, who have been entangled in America’s racially biased criminal justice system, and losing civil liberties like voting as a result.The barriers facing Americans like Tucker, advocates say, are modern adaptations of poll taxes and other devices which were designed to keep people from the voting booths during the Jim Crow era – when white politicians used the law to curb the civil rights of African Americans. Alabama is one of 30 states that requires people with felony convictions to pay back the financial obligations associated with their sentence before they can vote again.Tucker’s case is particularly glaring. He lives less than a hundred miles north-west of Selma, the birthplace of the voting rights movement in America. This week, civil rights leaders are commemorating the 55th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches led by Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights activists as they protested laws preventing African Americans from voting. Many were brutally beaten in Selma during the protests.The specific policy that had ensnared Tucker dates back to the turn of the 20th century when Alabama leaders, openly seeking to preserve white supremacy, stripped anyone convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude”, among other offenses, of the right to vote.“What is it that we want to do? Why it is within the limits imposed by the federal constitution, to establish white supremacy in this state,” John Knox, the chair of the convention, said at the time. “If we would have white supremacy, we must establish it by law – not by force or fraud,” he added.Tucker said the legacy of that discrimination affects the lives of people like him today.“I read about the challenges during the 60s, 50s, that black people had to overcome just to vote,” Tucker said. “It’s the same thing going on in 2020.”Tucker, who sometimes goes by Zo, speaks softly and deliberately. He has lived in Tuscaloosa his whole life, now in a modest house 10 minutes outside of downtown. He says he would have left the city where he grew up, but never had the money.Sitting in his living room, surrounded by pictures of family, Tucker said things are much different now for him than they were in the early 1990s, when he was much more “aggressive”. In the late 1980s, he got into a fight at a club with a University of Alabama football player and wound up being convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. A few years later, he fought with a police officer and was convicted of second-degree assault, a felony. He wound up going to prison for two years and serving several more on probation.After he got out of prison, Tucker rebuilt his life, working at steel factories and in maintenance, and chipping away at the approximately $1,600 that the court had ordered him to pay. He had two more children, which made him want to stay out of trouble. He joined the Nation of Islam.Before his conviction, Tucker had never voted. But in prison, Tucker had read about Medgar Evers, who fought for equal citizenship and was assassinated in Mississippi in 1963. When he got out, he started regularly voting in elections. He and his wife Narkita would bring his young children into the voting booth with them, wanting to teach them about the importance of a single vote, and the long struggle African Americans had faced to gain access to the ballot.But in 2013, Tucker got a letter from his state officials saying he could no longer vote.He was angry and upset, but didn’t act immediately – the letter didn’t tell him anything about how to get his voting rights back. Then came another letter, a few years later, this time addressed to his son, Alfonzo Tucker III, who had just turned 18, and claiming that he too was ineligible to vote. The younger Tucker, however, didn’t have a criminal record. It was a mistake, possibly because he shared his father’s name.Tucker got his son registered to vote, but the episode lit a fire in him. As the 2018 midterm elections approached, he went to an event where activists were helping people with felony convictions learn about their voting rights, and called up the Alabama board of pardons and paroles to talk about his case. Two weeks later, the board sent him a letter saying he still owed $135.10 in connection with his conviction.Tucker, who relies in part on disability income, borrowed money from his sister to pay off the debt. But just when he thought it was settled, a courthouse clerk told him he owed money for another decades-old criminal offense – an additional $5,535.47 which she said he had to pay back to gain back his vote.Faced with the staggering amount, Tucker contacted Blair Bowie, an attorney at Campaign Legal Center, a Washington DC voting rights group. It took Bowie 15 minutes to realize Alabama officials made a huge mistake.Under Alabama law, people with felonies only have to pay off the money originally assessed as part of their criminal conviction to regain their voting rights. By 2018, Tucker had paid back most of what he owed. But, unbeknown to him, the state had added an additional debt of $131.10, a fee that was irrelevant to whether he could vote because it was not part of his original conviction. And the $5,535.47 debt was from a misdemeanor offense, Bowie saw, which does not cause someone to lose their voting rights in Alabama.All that Tucker actually owed in order to vote was $4.“What is voter suppression if not officials wrongly telling you that you can’t vote?” Bowie said. “That’s been a classic way of disenfranchising people, particularly in Alabama.”After he paid the $135.10, Tucker drove two hours to Montgomery, the state capitol, with a friend to hand deliver the receipt to a staffer at the board of pardons and paroles.But weeks later he never heard anything back. The elections came and went, and Tucker couldn’t vote. The parole board declined to comment on Tucker’s case.Bowie eventually referred Tucker to John Paul Taylor, an organizer with the Southern Poverty Law Center, who followed up with the board and got Tucker registered to vote in 2019.Bowie and Taylor said Tucker shouldn’t have had to rely on experts to get his voting rights back.“Here’s a very clear example of a person who has jumped through every single hoop that you’ve given them and they’re still being denied because of something that they really don’t even know about,” Taylor said.Meanwhile, Tucker and Bill Foster, the friend he went to Montgomery with, helped start a group in Tuscaloosa to help assist people with felonies get their voting rights back. Tucker’s story helps people understand that they can in fact vote once they complete their sentence, said Larry Tucker, his cousin. And Alfonzo said he’s met other people who have wrongly been told they owe the state money.So far, Tucker estimates that they’ve been able to help about 10 people – people like Terrance Gray, 49, who learned he was eligible to vote last year. Gray believed he had been ineligible to vote since he was released from prison in 1996.“He told me that it will make a difference if more people go and vote,” Gray said of Tucker. “He’s always been on me about that.”Tucker plans to cast his first ballot since the ordeal this year (he says he likes Bernie Sanders). He thinks the state should give him back the extra $131.10 that he paid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

In evidence to the court she urged ICJ judges to dismiss allegations of genocide and instead allow the country’s court martial system to deal with any human rights abuses. A final judgement is expected to take years.In a statement, Clooney, the human rights lawyer and barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London, said: “Accountability for genocide in Myanmar is long overdue and I look forward to working on this important effort to seek judicial remedies for Rohingya survivors.”Clooney successfully represented former the Malian president Mohamed Nasheed and secured a UN decision that his 2015 jailing for 13 years was illegal.She also represented Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who spent more than 500 days in prison in Myanmar convicted of breaking the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The journalists had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in Rakhine state. They were freed in May 2019.The Gambia, a predominantly Muslim west African state, took the lead in the legal action when it submitted an application to the ICJ in 2019 alleging Myanmar breached the genocide convention, which was enacted after the Holocaust.Myanmar is accused over mass murder, rape and destruction of communities during an army crackdown in 2017.

She first tested positive on 29 January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on 1 February, before testing negative on 6 February.The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, Japanese media said.Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China.“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” said Professor Philip Tierno at New York University’s school of medicine.He said much remained unknown about the virus: “I’m not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,” he said, meaning the disease might appear to go away before recurring.The woman’s second positive test came as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose by 16 to 186, in addition to the 704 diagnosed from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Tokyo has urged that big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to contain the virus, while pledging the 2020 Olympic Games will still go ahead.Japan has changed its strategy, seeking to slow its spread and minimise the number of deaths, including by closing schools in affected areas.Meanwhile a major Japanese bank reported an employee had tested positive for coronavirus.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28ba615738489288ab5baab2a824997ecf865537/0_166_4937_2962/master/4937.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5d6b98f1af6941a3f8f72e6f9de392 220w","title":"coronavirus map how covid 19 is spreading across the world","story":"Confirmed cases of Covid-19 now  close to 50 countries, with at least 2,770 deaths, all but 55 in mainland China – data correct at 2356 GMT, 26 FebruaryThe coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people and the capital of Hubei province in China.

But the slow travel movement – a seismic shift in the mindset of once-frenetic holidaymakers – is one trend that seems set to stay. Casting aside the need for Instagram likes and bucket list ticks, slow travel shows there’s more to holidaying than whistle-stop city tours and frantic red-eye flights. Instead, we want to take our time over things: the slow swoosh of a sun-drenched French boat trip a peaceful cycle through the tulip fields of Holland a rocky amble around the Irish coast. Recently, the movement has been strengthened even further, as the Swedish concept of flygskam, or “flight shame” – which encourages people to boycott air travel in order to lower carbon emissions – takes hold. Now, how we travel is almost more important than where we travel, which makes getting about by ferry one of the wisest travel choices you can make. Here are a few more reasons to take to the seas.It allows you to connect with your passionsThe allure of travelling at your own pace is that you can explore a country under your own steam, be that on two feet or two wheels. If you’re an avid cyclist, taking the ferry means you can bring your beloved metal steed along with you to any destination at no extra cost (bike-friendly Holland should do the trick). And there’s no stingy baggage allowance or cramped overhead lockers to contend with, so you can bring all the energy bars and extra pairs of lycra you wish.Your holiday starts onboardRather than being confined to a few (small, uncomfortable) inches of a plane seat, there’s plenty to explore on the ferry. Kick back in the lounge with a newspaper, hot drink, comfortable seating and panoramic views of seabirds coasting over the ocean waves. Meanwhile, brasseries, food courts and bars offer more than enough options to settle grumbling bellies. You’ll find just as much freedom when you arrive at your destination, and as soon as your feet touch new soil you’ll be ready for your adventure, whether that’s exploring higgledy-piggledy French flea markets or cycling around Northern Ireland’s magnificent Causeway Coast – with no heinous jet lag.There’s no airport stressRare is the person who can pass through an airport unscathed by the stress of monstrous check-in queues, frustrating security processes and baggage handlers who treat moving suitcases like an Olympic discus event. Travelling by ferry offers a more laid-back approach, with streamlined boarding processes and no-fuss logistics. Best of all? There are no pesky “surprise” buses waiting to take you and a hundred other angry passengers to the correct terminal either.The fun’s in the journeyThink of slow travel as exploring the places “in between” A and B. By taking things slowly and savouring the journey, we become part of a place for a short time, rather than just lurching frantically through it. The deck of a ferry, the bunk of a cabin, or a window with expansive sea views becomes your new viewpoint, and you can immerse yourself in landscapes – from tiny islands to craggy coastlines – that you would never see from 35,000ft up, giving you a new appreciation of the part of the world that you’re travelling through.It broadens your horizonsPerhaps you’ve always stuck to the UK for your annual camping trip – liking the familiarity of that bluebell wood you know so well, or the campsite you love so much. Travelling by ferry allows you to push your boundaries a bit further and explore destinations you might never have previously considered. Why not swap the forests of England for the seaside campsites of Belgium? Or pay a visit to the historic battlefields of Ypres? Because really, exploring the unfamiliar is what adventure is all about.It’s ready-made mindfulnessNot all of us have time for meditation and paddleboard yoga, but there is something wonderfully calming about just slowing down. Getting anywhere by ship – where brains are lulled by the slow chug of the engine and frazzled nerves are calmed by the sound of the ocean – is about as close to mindfulness as you can get while not wearing a fluffy robe.

Rainfall accumulations of up to 30mm during Friday and Saturday generally but 40 to 50 mm of rain could fall in parts of Kerry.There is “a continuing risk of flooding” due to already saturated ground and elevated river levels, the forecaster added.A fourth, yellow weather alert is in place for Leinster, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford between 9am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday. Gusts of up to 110kmh are expected.An orange warning means there will be “infrequent and dangerous weather conditions which may pose a threat to life and property”.Met Éireann warns: “Prepare yourself in an appropriate way depending on location and activity. All people and property in the affected areas can be significantly impacted. Check your activityevent and delay or cancel as appropriate.”The yellow warning for the rest of the country indicates weather “that does not pose a threat to the general population but is potentially dangerous on a localised scale”.The forecaster warns: “Be aware about meteorological conditions and check if you are exposed to danger by nature of your activity or your specific location. Do not take any avoidable risks.”Storm Jorge, named by the Spanish Met Office, will begin with a low pressure centre that will track just across the north of Ireland on Saturday.It will start windiest in southern coastal regions such as counties Cork, Kerry Clare. “As Saturday progresses and the storm centre moves closer to the country and pulls away, we’ll get west and north-westerly winds in the northern counties,” said forecaster Joanna Donnelly.“The storm will pass on Saturday and the winds will ease through Sunday, but it will be very cold and there will be wintery precipitation. Monday and Tuesday will remain very cold with the likelihood of wintery precipitation again.“The storm will be over on Saturday but the weather will remain inclement.”Meanwhile, the weather on Thursday will be cold with frost, fog and icy patches clearing during the morning.Most places will be dry and bright with sunny spells, but scattered heavy showers will continue to affect parts of the north and northeast and some will be wintry.Temperatures will be cold with highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees in moderate to fresh northwest winds. Winds will ease and back westerly by evening.It will be mostly dry, clear and cold on Thursday evening and early in the night, with frost and icy patches returning for a time.Thickening cloud will bring a rise in temperatures as outbreaks of rain move in to the west and southwest and extend to most areas by Friday morning.It will remain cold in northern areas, where some falls of sleet or snow are possible for a time overnight. Lowest temperatures of - 1 to 2 degrees will occur early in the night. South to south-easterly winds will also increase, becoming strong near coasts later.Friday will be a cloudy and wet day, with outbreaks of rain and drizzle extending nationwide during the morning, with some heavy falls in the west and south.There will be some sleet and hill snow in northern areas for a time in the morning, but then turning to rain.Temperatures will be milder than recent days in many areas with afternoon temperatures ranging from 7 to 11 degrees generally, but cold in Ulster until later in the evening and breezy at times."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185547.1582757282!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what we know so far about how ireland is affected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing protective face masks arrive at the Hongqiao railway station in Shanghai. Photograph: Noel CelisAFP via Getty Images)Have there been any cases here so far?No. The Department of Health has said that 90 people have been tested for coronavirus in Ireland so far and all results have come back negative.That’s good, but what about Irish people abroad? Especially those who may be returning?Two Irish-German passengers who were on board the Princess Diamond cruise ship docked off Yokahama, Japan, tested positive for the coronavirus. They are not normally resident in Ireland are being treated in hospital in Japan.Elsewhere, a hotel on the island of Tenerife was placed under quarantine when an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the coronavirus. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance to a number of Irish citizens in the area.Two other Irish citizens were quarantined in Liverpool in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan. Both subsequently left quarantine and reported they were healthy and safe.Great stuff. But does all this mean we should avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei. It has also advised Irish citizens not to travel to areas of Italy affected by the outbreak. The travel advice applies to 10 specific towns where travel has been restricted, but not to the rest of the country.What if I’ve recently been to an affected area?Anyone who has been to an affected region (mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and call their GP.The same applies to anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of the virus in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms. Anyone who has been to an affected region in the last 14 days, and are well, should visit hse.ie for advice.So is this going to mess a lot of people’s holiday plans up?A number of secondary schools across Ireland have decided to cancel school trips to Italy in light of the latest travel advice.Alexandra College in Dublin confirmed it had cancelled the school’s annual trip for transition year students to Italy after a teacher, who organised the trip and is from Italy, consulted with local Italian authorities.Irish holiday makers are also reportedly cancelling trips to Italy. In some cases, these included bookings for holidays that are not due to take place until the summer. Travel agents have also said that, for now, Irish people are stalling on making bookings.Is that affecting airlines? And what about other businesses, and our tourism industry?The airlines are feeling the pinch alright. Earlier this week, investors began ditching stocks that they believed were vulnerable to a European outbreak. One of the biggest was Ryanair, whose shares tumbled 13.4 per cent in Dublin.Ryanair says all its flights are operating as normal but added that it would follow any public health instructions that were issued. The same is true of Aer Lingus.Elsewhere, Junayeo Air confirmed last week that it had decided to postpone the scheduled launch of its proposed Dublin-Shanghai service on March 29th until further notice.It’s not just the airlines either. Many Irish companies have operations in affected regions or depend on them for supply lines, and they are also dealing with some of the fallout. For example, one of our biggest companies, Kerry Group, said sales in China are set to fall by about 30 per cent in the first quarter of the year.What are we going to do about citizens from affected regions coming here?The DAA, which operates Dublin Airport, has said it is currently “business as usual” at the airport with flights from affected regions landing as normal.The Government is doing what it can to limit mass influxes from affected regions. The surge in cases in Italy has forced the cancellation of Ulster’s Pro 14 rugby game against Benetton in Treviso due to take place on Saturday.Minister for Health Simon Harris has also called for the Ireland’s Six Nations rugby match against Italy on March 7th to be called off. Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said more sporting fixtures could be cancelled if necessary to prevent the spread.Could we not just screen people as they arrive in Ireland?No. Entry screening for Covid-19 “doesn’t work, wouldn’t work” and would be a “waste of resources”, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said.Fair enough. Can expect other big events, like the St Patrick’s Day Festival, to follow suit then?The cancellation of mass gatherings, such as large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, “may be justified in exceptional circumstances” according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Decisions to cancel however will be co-ordinated with organisers and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis. But it’s possible we will see more major events cancelled.What about schools?During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control said.“There is also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now though, it seems unlikely.What are the chances of someone testing positive for the virus here and what happens then?Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the outbreak in Italy and in neighbouring countries means the chances of an Irish case in the coming days or weeks has increased significantly.He has designated the virus as a notifiable disease, which means doctors will be obliged to routinely notify the HSE when a case is diagnosed.The Department of Health is also understood to be looking at bringing the condition under legislation that would allow for a person with the virus to be detained and isolated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186051.1582760564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the independent groups who are they and what do they want","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndependent TDs Michael and Danny Healy-Rae will be hoping to influence government policy should an administration be formed. Photograph: Nick BradshawIn the immediate aftermath of the general election, much attention was given to the three big political parties and how they would go about the delicate and uncertain business of forming a Government.At the same time, the 21 mostly new Independent TDs of the 33rd Dáil were getting organised.Three separate groups have now emerged with many Independents hoping to share the role of kingmaker in the coming weeks, although all strenuously deny they can be bought with “wish lists”.The composition of each group is as multifarious as would be expected.The first comprises the rural Independents, including Mattie McGrath, Michael Healy-Rae, Danny Healy-Rae, Carol Nolan, Richard O’Donoghue and Michael Collins.Negotiating with such a erse range of TDs may prove complex. This was illustrated during a press conference given by the rural Independents after a meeting with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Wednesday afternoon.In front of Leinster House each TD outlined their priorities – sometimes talking over each other – and it ranged from sewerage schemes, the potential downgrading of Bantry hospital, recently introduced road traffic laws, the penalty points system and flooding.“The people of rural Ireland have sent us here to represent them. They feel . . . neglected, abandoned and even blackguarded by successive governments,” said Mattie McGrath.Parties such as Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil may be hoping to secure the support of these smaller groups of Independents in any future vote for taoiseach, but even this will not be a simple matter given the mix of views in each group.Carol Nolan, who left Sinn Féin after a three-month suspension over her abortion stance, was asked on Wednesday if she would vote for Mary Lou McDonald as taoiseach if the group decides to lean that way.“We work collectively ... It will be up to the group to decide,” she said.It is not just the three big parties who will have their work cut out when dealing with the Independent groups either.The second, and largest, Independent faction is the newly formed regional group. The convenor is Denis Naughten and it comprises eight other TDs including Seán Canney, Michael Lowry, Peadar Tóibín of Aontú, Verona Murphy, Noel Grealish, Peter Fitzpatrick, Cathal Berry and Matt Shanahan.This group wasted no time in banding together and met Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar on Tuesday where members urged both leaders to increase the tempo of Government talks.“We have said, look, two of three parties need to come together and get going on a programme for government. And we are willing to engage at that stage. It is very early days, but we made it clear that there is an urgency to move this along and they cannot continue to navel gaze and rule each other out,” said Naughten.The regional group is a technical formation, said Naughten, meaning they exist mainly to ensure they are allocated speaking time in the Dáil and to give them first dibs on Oireachtas committees of which they want membership.Despite this being the original aim, Government formation talks were held en masse with the party leaders although Tóibín sat out of the talks with Varadkar. The group are united by a desire to ensure better regional balance, said Naughten.The final group is referred to informally as the Independent group. It includes Joan Collins, Catherine Connolly, Thomas Pringle, Marian Harkin, Michael McNamara and Michael Fitzmaurice.Fitzmaurice is in the process of drawing up a document of his key demands which he plans to circulate to the main parties. The document includes suggestions on how to reform the civil service and increase oversight of local government.Harkin, who was first elected to the Dáil in 2002 and who served as an MEP from 2004 to 2019, said this group will be prioritising the future of farming, agriculture and food production as well as flooding, housing and health.She also said the roll-out of broadband will be a “bottom line” issue and that a strong focus must be placed on balanced regional development.One senior Fine Gael TD with experience of negotiating with Independents in the past said that the task ahead, if Independents are to be included in government again, will be difficult for any party spearheading the process.“There are three main qualities that matter. The first is the degree to which you are negotiating with a group, or a collection of iniduals. Are you dealing with a single set of cohesive demands or is it a group of iniduals with their own needs. It will be important in what is about to ensue.“The second thing that would matter would be the degree to which people have either constituency issues they are looking to prioritise or national issues they want to influence. The third factor is if people are elected on a single matter, or elected on a wider cause.“This time will be more complicated than the last with multiple parties and a wider selection of Independents with a variety of views.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186759.1582806543!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus woman tests postive for a second time in japan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorkers wearing protective gears arrive to spray disinfectant as a precaution against the new coronavirus in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: Ahn Young-joonAP PhotoA woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time, raising fears that the virus may remain dormant in those who contract it.She is the first known person in Japan and one of very few worldwide to test positive a second time amid growing concerns about the spread of the infection.The number of cases Japan has now risen to more than 200 and the country’s primary and secondary schools will be asked to close from March 2nd until their upcoming spring break to help contain the coronavirus outbreak, prime minister Shinzo Abe said.In Italy, which is a European epicentre of the illness, two more people were reported dead on Thursday bringing the death toll to 14.Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15, the Department of Health said on Thursday. The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife to these patients who have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London.Though Ireland remains free of confirmed cases, widening concern over the threat posed by the virus has forced the cancellation of next month’s Ireland-Italy rugby games and may impact other mass gatherings, including the St Patrick’s Day festival.There was confusion too among schools with students returning in recent days from ski trips in areas of Italy affected by coronavirus clusters. Some schools sent pupils who had been in Italy home for several days as a precautionary measure, while in other schools, students, assuming they were well, were required to attend classes.PilgrimsThe decision by Saudi Arabia to suspend arrivals by foreigners for the Umrah pilgrimage and tourists from some two dozen countries where the coronavirus has spread comes ahead of the holy fasting of Ramadan, which begins in late April this year, when visits by Muslims to the kingdom accelerate.French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned on Tuesday an epidemic that is on the way”. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died.China’s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths.The official death toll from covid-19 cases in Iran has increased to 22 people. Officials also said that 141 people have tested positive for the virus, but experts fear Iran is under reporting the true scale of the outbreak.Saudi Arabia has barred foreign visitors going on pilgrimage or Umrah in the country although the country has not reported any cases of the virus.As a result, Emirates airline says passengers from a number of countries - including China, Japan, Italy, Iran, India and Pakistan - won’t be allowed to fly with them to Saudi Arabia. The virus has infected about 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800, the majority in China where the outbreak began in late 2019. The number of new infections inside China was for the first time overtaken by new cases elsewhere on Wednesday, with Italy and Iran emerging as epicentres of the illness. Australia initiated emergency measures and Taiwan raised its epidemic response level to its highest, a day after US president Donald Trump put his vice president, Mike Pence, in charge of the US response to the looming global health crisis.Mr Trump has sought to play down the threat from coronavirus despite mounting concerns about unchecked worldwide contagion. In a press conference in Washington, the US president said the danger to Americans “remains very low” and predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, currently on 15, could fall to zero in a “few days”.The United States and South Korea have also postponed joint military drills to limit the spread of the virus, which has emerged far beyond China, where it originated late last year, apparently in a market selling wildlife in the city of Wuhan.Stocks sunk deeper into the red, oil prices fell and US treasuries rallied into record territory as more signs of the global spread of the virus heightened fears of a pandemic.Global markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than $3.6 trillion (€3.2tn) in value.The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China. Much remains unknown about the virus but it is clear the ramifications of the world’s second-biggest economy in lockdown for a month or more are vast.The rapid spread of the virus in different places - notably Italy, Iran and South Korea - in recent days has met the definition for a pandemic, and raised alarm.There is no cure for the virus that can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.First casesThere have been 3,246 cases outside China, including 51 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.A number of countries have reported their first cases in the past couple of days with the latest being Denmark, in a man who returned from a ski holiday in Italy, and Estonia, in a man returning from Iran, media reported.Brazil confirmed Latin America’s first infection on Wednesday.China reported 433 new cases on Thursday, against 406 a day earlier.South Korea reported another 334 cases, pushing its total to 1,595, the most in any country other than China.The US state department issued a new travel warning for South Korea after the US military reported on Wednesday its first case of the coronavirus, in a 23-year-old soldier based near the South Korean city of Daegu.The South Korean military has also reported a number of infections and confined most troops to base.A “command post training”, usually conducted by members of the two militaries’ combined forces command, will be postponed until further notice, the command said.The outbreak has played havoc with international aviation with airlines cancelling flights as countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel plans.News that a Korean Air flight attendant who worked on flights between Seoul and Los Angeles later tested positive, is likely to unnerve passengers further. – AgenciesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186017.1582788891!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus and europe hand shaking hand washing and hand wringing in brussels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHand gel: Hand-shaking is something of an occupational health risk. File photograph: EPAIn the literary technique of foreshadowing, small details appear early on in a story that are later revealed to have deep significance to the plot.On my first week on the job of Europe Correspondent, I found myself wondering what might augur the development of the coronavirus into a major world crisis.Would it be the bottles of hand sanitiser that appeared around European institutions in Brussels, only to empty within a day?\u0026nbspWas it the discussion of whether to stock up on food that broke out on the family chat group?Or could it be the note of urgency among journalists as they inquired in press conferences about the travel history of European leaders, and whether they felt in good health?There are few degrees of separation between members of the world’s governments. They ping-pong between bilaterals, before gathering to all shake hands with each other at councils like the one held for European Union ministers to discuss enlargement and Brexit this week.Hand-shaking is something of an occupational health risk: disinfectant gel is nothing new to diplomats, who apply it regularly to combat infection risks from the hundreds of hands they clasp in the course of their work.The World Health Organisation advises that the simple act of hand-washing – especially after any toilet visit, before eating, or touching the face – is the most crucial factor in combating the spread of disease.But large numbers of Europeans do not automatically wash their hands after toilet visits. According to a 2015 survey by Gallup, 74 per cent of people do so in Ireland, and the worst offenders are the Italians and the Dutch, on just 57 and 50 per cent.As for wearing face masks, the practice is new outside of Asia and commonly seen as precious. It’s\u0026nbspmisunderstood: the emphasis is not to protect the inidual from the crowd, but rather the opposite. In Japan it’s seen as an act of civic duty, to prevent transmission of germs from the wearer to others.The issue of coronavirus was to dominate my first attendance of the European Commission’s midday press briefing for journalists, in which spokespeople for the EU’s executive branch make announcements and take rounds of questions on the issues of the day.On Monday the commission announced a tranche of funding to find a vaccine, and said it was encouraging co-ordination in the response of member states as it awaited the report of a delegation of experts sent to Rome.The situation was developing rapidly. Italy had responded with gusto to an escalating outbreak, putting entire towns into quarantine and curbing public gatherings across much of its north. There had been ad hoc stops of travellers leaving to Austria and on a bus to France. This raised questions about the endurance of the Schengen Area – the zone of check-free travel that includes most EU countries, though not Ireland. Any closure of borders due to a health crisis would be a first in European history.But a rapidly spreading virus does not correspond perfectly with the commission’s ision of technical specialties.\u0026nbspNone of the array of spokespeople dedicated to migration, home affairs, public health, or finance were able – or perhaps willing – to answer the kinds of questions the journalists raised at the briefing: Were member states adequately prepared? Would borders be closed? Are the number of infections in Italy so high partly because it is doing more testing?Patience began to frayA noxious dynamic was evident between the spokespeople and the press pack, as journalists increasingly digressed into little frustrated polemics. In response, officials retreated to repetitious prepared sentences or procedural explanations about the ision of powers and competences, with the weary irony of teachers explaining simplicities to a rambunctious class.“Again, a lot of elements to your question actually, I have to say, only very few of them specifically relate to the rules that govern the Schengen Area as such,” was one typical response.Patience began to fray.“We don’t want to have a fight with you, not today,” one increasingly exasperated journalist told the commission officials. “Just in the one hour since we’ve been sitting here, an additional person has died in Italy.”It seemed an illustration of European paralysis, a phenomenon which limits the bloc’s ability to act even as it professes ambitions of greater influence on global challenges like peace and climate change.If a problem is big enough, the EU faces expectations that it should act. But when confronted with a crisis, the commission retreats into technicalities and struggles to dynamically respond: a function of the limitations of its powers, as prescribed by EU member states.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186679.1582800696!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk says it could abandon brexit trade talks in june","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson: The document rejects the EU’s call for an overarching agreement to cover trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. Photograph:  Daniel Leal-OlivasAFP via Getty ImagesBritain has published its blueprint for a future relationship with the European Union that envisages a bare-bones free trade agreement with no alignment of standards or regulations. It warns that if there is insufficient progress towards reaching agreement by the end of June, Britain could abandon talks in favour of preparing for trade with no deal from the end of the year.The 30-page negotiating mandate rejects the EU’s demand for a level playing field based on current shared rules on state aid, competition policy, taxation, employment and environmental rights.The document also rejects the EU’s call for an overarching agreement to cover trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. Instead, it proposes separate agreements, with the EU’s trade deal with Canada as the starting point for a future economic relationship.“It is a vision of a relationship based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, with both parties respecting one another’s legal autonomy and right to manage their own resources as they see fit. Whatever happens, the government will not negotiate any arrangement in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life. That means that we will not agree to any obligation for our laws to be aligned with the EU’s or for the EU’s institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK,” it says.The two sides have agreed to seek a deal by the end of this year and Britain has ruled out seeking an extension to the transition period that ends on December 31st. To secure such an extension, Britain would have to request it in advance of a planned high-level meeting with the EU in June.“The government would hope that by that point, the broad outline of an agreement would be clear and be capable of being rapidly finalised by September. If that does not seem to be the case at the June meeting, the government will need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion,” the negotiating mandate says.Although Britain rejects the EU’s call for binding level playing field commitments based on EU standards, the document calls for “reciprocal commitments” not to lower employment and environmental standards to encourage trade and investment. It also opens the door to reciprocal agreements on state aid and taxation.The negotiations begin in Brussels next week, with a second round planned for London in mid-March.

But that is the situation the 38-year-old, due to give birth on Thursday, finds herself in.It has been horrific and just shocking, says Mrs Mason-Gunning, whose family were evacuated from the business on Tuesday evening as the River Severn burst its banks. She estimates the damage caused by the flooding to stretch into the thousands of pounds. I\u0027m just trying to stay calm, she says.They are among dozens of residents and businesses in the Ironbridge Gorge to have been evacuated in recent days as the swollen river rose to near-record levels.On Wednesday morning, homes in the Wharfeage area of Ironbridge – a world heritage site containing the first ever iron bridge – were evacuated as temporary flood barriers, which had held during the past week of downpours, were finally overwhelmed. At its peak, the river reached 6.8 metres at Ironbridge, just shy of the 7.04-metre record set in 2000. Even with levels slowly coming down, Environment Agency pumps worked into the evening amid fears that water would engulf parts of the historic town if they stopped.David Nolan, 63, was among those evacuated when police officers urged him and his wife to leave their three-storey Georgian home. Until now the barriers have done their job pretty well, but the sheer force of the water is what has been so destructive, he says.The Tontine Hotel, a local pub that overlooks the bridge, has taken in some of the evacuees. By the afternoon, it had temporarily run out of real ale because delivery trucks could not get past the emergency crews.Other evacuees were taken to the Valley Hotel on the other side of Ironbridge, among them Ian Donnelly, a 45-year-old retired Royal Artillery warrant officer who now works in the NHS and has been staying here since Monday. We were allowed to collect a few things and then had to decide what to sacrifice, he says. He and his partner still have no idea of the damage that has been done to their home by the floods. The last thing we want to do is put somebody at risk trying to get back inside the property, he explains.Some Ironbridge residents described seeing fish swimming in their front gardens, while others spoke of ducks cruising past their front doors.In the nearby village of Dale End, Brooke Evans, 26, who only opened her hair salon in December, has been flooded three times in a week and had to don waders to even access the business.Her cellar has flooded and, like many businesses and homeowners in the area, she can\u0027t get insurance to pay for the damage and loss of earnings. We knew it was close to a river – but never in a million years did I expect it to be like this, she says.Communities downstream of Ironbridge remain braced for yet more flooding. The village of Bewdley, 20 miles or so away, flooded on Tuesday evening when water spilled over the top of temporary defences. It has been warned to prepare for another deluge. The Environment Agency says the flooding along the Severn, England\u0027s longest river, will persist until Sunday at the earliest, with more rainfall forecast for the coming days.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 27th february 2020","story":"Harry Styles performs onstage during the Citi Concert Series on TODAY Presents Harry Styles at Rockefeller Plaza, New York CityKevin MazurGetty Images for CitiCoronavirus latest news: Two new confirmed cases in England, bringing UK total to 15Politics latest news: Government defeated in plans for Heathrow expansionHammer-wielding wine thief is spared prison because she is transgenderChina sending 100,000-strong \u0026#39duck army\u0026#39 to Pakistan to fight locust plagueIllegal drug use costs society £19 billion a year through violence, crime and ill-health, finds reviewSt David\u0026#39s Day 2020: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became an iconic symbolWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?UK sets out its red lines for Brexit deal - and warns no deal is still an option Heathrow airport: Third runway plans blocked by Court of AppealUK weather: Flooding devastation set to last 10 daysNorth Korea imposes draconian measures to keep coronavirus at bayHow the Spring Equinox marks the changing seasonsRecovered patient in Japan continues to test positive for coronavirus as PM orders all schools to closeFive murdered in shooting spree by \u0026#39sacked worker\u0026#39Comment: Farmers are the victims of an ideological war against meat Thursday morning news briefing: Ministers push to halt coronavirus panicWhy actors practiced terrible football for new Julian Fellowes dramaExclusive: Briton who set up Trump Tower meeting denies Russian conspiracy, saying his offer \u0026#39was pure puffery\u0026#39Comment: A chilling logic lurks beneath the EU\u0026#39s farcical Brexit strategyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/25/15/chopfather.jpg","title":"business names wit pun surelock homes spruce springclean poll","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Many claim they are more likely to recommend a business with a witty\u0026nbspnameSurelock Homes, Planet of the Grapes and Spruce Springclean have been found\u0026nbspto be\u0026nbspsome of the wittiest names for businesses in Britain, according to\u0026nbspa poll.A poll of 2,000 adults asked people to nominate their favourite pun-based\u0026nbspcompany names, with results including\u0026nbspa barbers\u0026nbspnamed The Chopfather and a\u0026nbspcoffee shop titled\u0026nbspDeja Brew.An earlier survey\u0026nbspfound that 79 per cent of those polled\u0026nbspsaid a business name helps express its personality and branding.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the same poll, 43\u0026nbspper cent claimed they are more likely to recommend a business with a witty name, compared to one with a more traditional moniker.Lisa Jacobs, UK managing director at SME lending platform Funding Circle, which commissioned the research said: “It’s great how small businesses bring their characters and personalities through with these imaginative names whilst also brightening up our days with a laugh or chuckle.Created with Sketch.

Allowing students to apply after they receive their results would bring us into line with the rest of the world and eliminate the use of controversial unconditional offers.“This review is the opportunity for us to finally move to a system where university offers are based on actual achievement rather than unreliable estimates of potential.”Claire Sosienski Smith, vice president of higher education at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: “It has been clear that for some time the admissions system has not been working in the interest of students, so it is good to see that the OfS is taking action.”Any changes to the admissions system will require the agreement of policymakers, universities and colleges, exam boards and schools, the OfS has said.\u0026nbspGovernment could scrap university offers based on A-level predictionsLabour will scrap university offers based on predicted A-level gradesConcerns over \u0027irresponsible\u0027 rise in unconditional university offersUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said the regulator’s review would be “instrumental” in helping to assess how the system can be improved.\u0026nbspShe said: “Our world-leading universities should be open to everyone with the potential.

There is, however, a caveat.Researcher Ben Tippett said at the time: “While it is mathematically feasible, it is not yet possible to build a space-time machine because we need materials – which we call exotic matter –\u0026nbspto bend space-time in these impossible ways, but they have yet to be discovered.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is also relatively similar to Earth: with a radius 2.6 times as big as our planet\u0027s and a mass 8.6 times Earth\u0027s.The world known as\u0026nbspK2-18b is also already somewhat famous. It was discovered in 2017, prompting frenzied speculation about what conditions might be like there, and was the subject of even more excitement towards the end of last year, when it was the first ever potentially habitable planet found to have water vapour in its atmosphere.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

And it suggests that they could be habitable in just the way scientists had hoped.Nasa loses contact with satellite monitoring mysterious exoplanetsDr Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge\u0027s Institute of Astronomy, who led the study, said: Water vapour has been detected in the atmospheres of a number of exoplanets but, even if the planet is in the habitable zone, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean there are habitable conditions on the surface.To establish the prospects for habitability, it is important to obtain a unified understanding of the interior and atmospheric conditions on the planet - in particular, whether liquid water can exist beneath the atmosphere.Because of the size of K2-18b, some suggest it would be more like a smaller version of Neptune than a larger version of Earth.It is thought a mini-Neptune would have a significant hydrogen envelope surrounding a layer of high-pressure water, with an inner core of rock and iron.If this envelope is too thick, it would be too hot, and pressure at the surface of the water layer beneath would be far too great to support life.According to the new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, despite the size of K2-18b, its hydrogen envelope is not necessarily too thick and the water layer could support life.Astronomers used the existing observations of the atmosphere, to confirm the atmosphere is hydrogen-rich with a significant amount of water vapour.They also found that levels of other chemicals such as methane and ammonia were lower than expected.But whether these levels can be attributed to biological processes remains to be seen.The minimum amount of hydrogen is about one-millionth by mass, similar to the mass fraction of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Women are really motivated when they freeze eggs.“They think long and hard about this medical choice. It is costly. You do not do it lightly. It is not appropriate for women to be thwarted because the current legislation is not appropriate. Current laws are out of date with modern medical practice.”The current process means if a woman freezes her eggs in her early twenties – the time at which she is most fertile – she must utilise the eggs by the time she is in her early thirties.Researchers argue the 10-year cut off point could deter women from freezing their eggs in their twenties and lead to them doing so in their thirties despite their chances of successfully getting pregnant being lower.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Family planning is changing and many people choose to have children later in life. We wish to ensure that those who want to have a baby have the best possible chance of success.”Only eggs that are stored for medical reasons can be preserved for longer – up to 55 years in total.Adam Balen, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Currently, the 10-year limit is too restrictive and not fit for purpose.“It seems likely that the future will see increasing numbers of women storing eggs, mostly because they are not in a relationship, but there remains a need for societal changes that support women in the workplace to have their family at a biologically optimal age if they so choose without compromising their career prospects.“There remains an increasing recognition of the need to improve public education about age-related changes in female fertility that should highlight the importance of men’s knowledge as well as women.”Researchers called for women who choose to freeze their eggs to be “fully informed” of the likelihood of success, costs and risks – drawing attention to the fact that the latest data shows only 18 per cent of IVF treatments that utilised a woman’s own frozen eggs resulting in success.Egg freezing for non-medical reasons can only be accessed through the private health sector and is costly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Over 199 episodes, the series followed Ironside and his team in his role as consultant to the Police Department as they sorted out the bad guys of the City by the Bay.    Ian Rankin says he has never watched any of the television adaptions of his famously brooding, heavy drinking, loner detective because he didn’t want the actors’ faces replacing how he envisaged Rebus in his head. Two actors have played Rebus on screen, John Hannah and Ken Stott. Hannah gives the role his best but was probably too young and lacked the cynical gravitas that Stott gave to Rebus. With similar roles in The Vice and Messiah giving Stott an identifiable acting persona, he perhaps has the same problem as Humphrey Bogart being too much like Bogart to play the definitive Philip Marlowe, but in the absence of any other candidates, Stott is just fine. Rankin’s central theme of the Jekyll and Hyde dichotomy of Scotland’s capital city remains intact, and as in the novels, the real star of the show is of course, Edinburgh itself in all its historic beauty, showing the dark underbelly of the city behind the chintz curtains. 320 18. Life on Mars (2006-07)Nostalgia might not be what it used to be, but the biggest mystery with Life on Mars is why it took someone so long to come up with this inspired paean to the pop culture and TV cop shows of the 1970s. Throw in the fish-out-of-water time travel motif and the tongue in cheek non-PC scripts and characters, and its not hard to see why the series struck a chord with audiences.    Like many of his ilk, dedicated near-genius DCI John Luther (a brilliant Idris Elba) is a tormented soul, struggling with his own inner demons, hugely affected by the stomach churning crimes he investigates. Luther is so obsessive that he will do anything to get his man (or woman, in the case of his nemesis, the psychopathic scientist Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) Both cerebral and heart pumping, Luther was created by Neil Cross and has spawned American and Russian versions.Gillian Anderson is the deliberate, dedicated senior detective on the trail of an equally meticulous serial killer in this controversial drama filmed and set in Northern Ireland. The Fall survived accusations of misogyny and voyeurism to lift a Bafta for best television drama and keep viewers hooked for three series, but remains a troubling, unsettling experience for many.620 15. Cagney and Lacey (1981-88)The cop show that more than any other blew the stereotypical image of female police officers out of the water, and challenged the sexist attitudes of many executives in the television industry. Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless won the hearts of millions of viewers, and six Emmys between them, as two dedicated New York police officers who happened to be women with normal lives and challenges like everyone else. The bond between the two characters was unbreakable despite leading entirely different lives (Lacey was married with a family and supportive husband, Cagney drifted from relationship to relationship). A game changer in many ways, Cagney and Lacey explored issues such as rape, abortion and Cagney’s alcoholism head on.720 14. Between the Lines (1992-94)Set in the politan Police Complaints Investigation Bureau, the Bafta winning Between the Lines follows ambitious Chief Superintendent Tony Clarke and his team as they investigate corruption within the police force. Between the Lines drew praise for the way it tackled topical issues of the day as it attempted to address the age old moral dilemma, quis custodiet ipsos custodes – who will guard the guards themselves?The cop show that more than any other blurred the lines between the good guys and the bad guys. Rogue cop Vic Mackey leads the elite “strike force” of LA detectives who routinely break the law to keep the streets safe, but also to feather their own nest. There are subplots aplenty, and Mackey’s downfall plays out almost like a Shakespearean tragedy.Set in the fictional northern town of Newtown, Z Cars broke new ground in police drama shows, challenging the homely predictability of the likes of Dixon of Dock Green. Devised by Allan Prior and Troy Kennedy Martin, the series centred on not just one central protagonist, but rather several police officers both uniformed and plain clothed. Z Cars brought some iconic characters into the nation’s living rooms such as detective Charlie Barlow, PC “Fancy” Smith and desk sergeant Bert Lynch. The police officers themselves were portrayed warts and all, with gritty subject matter, including domestic abuse at the hands of a police officer, at the heart of the storylines. The actors became household names with the iconic theme tune whistled on everyone’s lips, and of course there were the “Z” cars themselves, the American-style Ford Zephyr and Zodiac patrol cars.   If Cagney and Lacey blazed the trail for female cops, then the first series of Prime Suspect in particular indicated a seismic shift in the perception of, and the attitudes towards, the female police officer. Helen Mirren is outstanding as DCI Jane Tennison who heads a murder squad hunting a sadistic serial killer, but has to overcome opposition and resentment from her team as well as the institutionalised sexism of the police department itself. Subsequent series concentrated more on Tennison’s inner demons as she began to rely on alcohol to help her cope with the pressures of the job.  This Danish police procedural and prime example of Scandinavian noir attracted criticism for its violence against women. It did, however, become an international success particularly in the UK. Viewers were gripped by the formula that of each episode reflecting 24 hours in the same murder case, and by the cold-fish female detective protagonist Sarah Lund, while developing an almost fetishist fascination with her knitwear. The Killing paved the way for other subtitled European crime dramas and equally popular and acclaimed entries such as The Bridge and Borgen quickly followed.     1220 9. Law and Order (1990-2010)Filmed in New City with a two-pronged approach of the investigation of a crime and arrest of a suspect, followed by the suspect’s trial, Law and Order introduced one of the great small-screen detectives, recovering alcoholic Lennie Briscoe. (Jerry Orbach). The show’s boast was that many of its subject matters were “ripped from the headlines” and it was this approach that gave it a compelling topical feel and made it the longest-running American crime series and the benchmark for police procedurals.1320 8. Line of Duty (2012- )An outstanding ratings success for BBC2, Jed Mercurio’s masterful police corruption thriller gripped viewers from the very beginning and kept them guessing until the explosive climax to the third series. The bold, serpentine and gripping storylines provided the exemplary cast with parts of a lifetime, with the most outstanding feature of Line of Duty undoubtedly the lengthy interrogation scenes as the tension was racked up notch by notch. After Bing Crosby turned the role down, Peter Falk became synonymous with the cigar smoking, dishevelled police lieutenant in a shabby raincoat, winning four Emmys and a Golden Globe. Referred to as a “howcatchem” by its’ creators, Columbo deviated from the traditional whodunit in that the audience and, it seemed, Columbo himself, knew the identity of the murderer from the start. Half the fun of the show was watching the murderer (frequently an A- or B-list guest star) underestimate the seemingly bumbling, absent-minded detective while he baited the trap to snare them. Oh, and just one more thing, as Columbo himself might say: although Columbo routinely spoke of his wife, she was never seen in any episode, but the character was later given her own, short-lived, spin-off show, Mrs Columbo. It has been compared to the works of Dickens and Dostoevsky and lauded as the greatest television programme ever. But the triumph of The Wire is how it tells the story of the decaying city of Baltimore through the lives of the police, drug dealers, politicians, children and the dispossessed, making no moral judgements between good and bad in a predominately grey world. The Wire may not be the greatest television programme ever, but its realism and authenticity can never be in doubt. In 2005, members of a drugs gang claimed they had studied The Wire in order to learn about the latest police surveillance techniques, surely the ultimate example of life imitating art. Aping its antecedent Hill Street Blues’ cinema verite style, multi award winning NYPD Blue was a natural progression for co-creator Steven Bochno, who along with David Milsch came up with even grittier storylines, atmospheric New York locations and warts ’n all characters to create a hugely compelling and influential cop show. But let’s be honest, despite a terrific ensemble cast, Dennis Franz as scenery-chewing recovering alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, was virtually the whole show, appearing in all 261 episodes and in the process searing his psyche in viewers’ minds.1720 4. Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-98)Baltimore native Barry Levinson was a natural fit as executive producer of this ultra-realistic police procedural, based on The Wire creator David Simon’s book chronicling his experiences following homicide detectives at work in the so-called “City of Firsts”. From the very first episode Life on the Street succeeded in dispelling the myths and stereotypes about the television cop, showing that murder and violence were just a routine parts of the job. Indeed the murder of a schoolgirl in that first episode was never solved. Aficionados rate this show even better than The Wire. Some have called Homicide: Life on the Street the missing link between Hill Street Blues and The Wire. Beg, borrow or steal the box set and find out why.   Such is the renown of the celebrated television adaptation of Colin Dexter’s novels featuring the enigmatic real-ale swilling, arts loving, crossword buff detective, that there’s very little left to say apart from it’s basically a brilliant variation on the classic English whodunit, Kevin Whately’s Lewis is to John Thaw’s Morse as Dr Watson was to Sherlock Holmes, and Thaw is simply wonderful.It has become so caricatured and parodied in recent years that it’s easy to overlook the fact that The Sweeney made Z Cars look as antiquated as the former did Dixon of Dock Green a decade earlier. Created by Ian Kennedy Martin, brother of Z Cars co-creator Troy, The Sweeney was shot in 16mm film and that, along with extensive location shooting, gave it a more cinematic look than other studio-bound rivals. Created by Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll and still celebrated, still hugely influential, and still the cop show to which almost everything that has come since owes a huge debt. From Mike Post’s iconic theme and the innovative cinema vèritè-evoking handheld camera, to the brilliant ensemble cast creating beloved characters and dramatic storylines in the urban sprawl of an unnamed US city, Hill Street Blues pioneered a new wave of cop shows. Ironically, it never gained huge audience ratings, but garnered a grand total of 98 Emmy nominations. Groundbreaking, thought provoking, emotional and funny, Hill Street Blues stands tall in the canon of truly great television.Launched to much fanfare as a television movie and boasting a killer theme tune from Quincy Jones, Ironside starred Raymond Burr, who was still hot after his stint as television’s Perry Mason, as San Francisco Chief of Police Robert T Ironside, who is confined to a wheelchair after an attempted assassination.

What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way.

She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show.

The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore.

I don’t even remember doing it. I don’t know why I did that but it was definitely unnecessary for sure.”She also spoke about her regrets over her own drinking on the series. “I think there’s a reason that there’s sometimes alcohol around during these reality shows,” she said. “Sometimes you loosen up and these moments can kind of come out.

It follows a hypnotist\u0026nbsp(Wener Krauss) who uses a sleepwalker (Conrad Viedt) to commit murders.Since its release in 1920, the film has been considered a defining film of the German Expressionist cinema movement, alongside others\u0026nbspdirected by\u0026nbspFW Murnau\u0026nbsp(Nosferatu, 1922) and\u0026nbspFritz Lang (polis, 1927).Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThese films typically feature protagonists amid nightmarish landscapes, which were stylised in ways that went on to inspire everything from the music of David Bowie to\u0026nbspthe films of Tim Burton.The Cabinet of Dr Caligari was written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz\u0026nbspin the aftermath of the First World War, with its influences laid bare in the film’s characters: Caligari is a symbol of the German war government, while the somnambulist is a representation of everyday people who were conditioned to kill as soldiers.New horror film branded ‘scariest in years’ after Sundance premiereUnearthed article recounts the chaos and panic caused by The Exorcist 37 horror films that will actually scare youBoth Mayer and Janowitz were pacifists.Intriguingly, the film\u0027s twist ending is claimed to have been forced into the plot against the writers\u0027 will. Not that its addition muddied the film’s success – critic Roger Ebert famously called it “the first true horror film” and its ensuing success\u0026nbsphelped enhance the artistic merit of German cinema.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The most shocking film twists of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t.

The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand.

He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The Cabinet of Dr Caligari\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No one cares about snakes. When it\u0027s a furry, charismatic animal, it makes it different\u0027Experts are struggling to respond to an invasive species of herpes-infected monkeys roaming around Florida after a spate of sightings raised fears the primate\u0026nbsppopulation in the state is spiralling\u0026nbspout of control.Just six monkeys arrived in Florida as tourist attractions in the 1930s but the animals have since spread and multiplied to an estimated population of between 550 and 600 around Silver Springs State Park.Although researchers are worried about the herpes B virus they carry and the potential for them to harm other species, park officials have avoided controlling numbers of the rhesus macaque species, which has become a beloved tourist highlight in the state.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“People feel really emotionally connected to these animals,” Jane Anderson, an assistant professor of research at the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, told The Washington Post.Created with Sketch.Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2019: The Winners Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the Year115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the YearMs Anderson, who has studied the growth of the monkeys and estimated their population size, has expressed concerns that further growth could harm birds in the area, such as qualls.In past incidents, rhesus macaques have wreaked havoc on new habitats, such as in Puerto Rico, where studies showed their introduction in the 1960s destroyed seabird populations.However, it may soon become impossible to ignore the growing problem as researchers estimate that by 2022, the monkey population will have doubled.“I understand why they don\u0027t want to address the issue. It\u0027s a lose-lose situation,” Steve Johnson, a University of Florida professor of wildlife ecology and conservation who co-authored the research, told USA Today.“But if they do nothing, they are potentially opening up a barrel of monkeys, so to speak.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Johnson noted that officials have struggled to control the population due to public support for the animals, who have captured the hearts of visitors to the state.“It\u0027s not an issue if it\u0027s catching pythons. No one cares about snakes. When it\u0027s a furry, charismatic animal, it makes it different.”In the past, monkeys in the area have been trapped and sold for biomedical research over concerns about them plundering birds’ nest and potentially passing herpes on to humans.But that solution also received backlash from animal rights groups concerned about the monkeys’ welfare.“It is a tragedy that wild monkeys are torn from their families and forest homes and sold to research and testing laboratories,” one group said in 2013, as reported by the local Ocala Star-Banner newspaper.Although the chances of humans being infected by the monkeys are slim, a study published in a journal of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described herpes B as a “public health concern” and concluded up to 30 per cent of the park’s macaques shed the virus in their saliva, urine and faeces.“Hundreds of bites and scratches occur every year in monkey facilities in the United States, but people rarely get infected with B virus,” the CDC said on its website.Park officials have resorted to warning tourists to keep their distance from the monkeys, instead of actively controlling the population, amid concerns about aggression from the animals towards visitors.“We tell people not to approach them, not to feed them, because we want people to stay safe,” Craig Littauer, a park services specialist, told The Post.Trump to be protected by monkey police on India visit‘New species of monkey’ discovered in Amazon rainforestThree dolphins found shot and killed off Florida coastFlorida could use drones to fight pythons Frozen iguanas to fall from trees in Florida, forecasters warnHowever, despite concerns\u0026nbspabout the population growth, the monkeys remain a popular tourist attraction.“First thing everyone asks about is the monkeys,” Nick Bozman, who runs tours transporting visitors along the park’s Silver River, told the Ocala Star-Banner.Nevertheless, he admitted\u0026nbspthe animals were “not supposed to be here”.“It\u0027s a double-edged sword,” he told the newspaper.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 February“I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing,” Mr Sanders later told CNN. “That is a fact. End of discussion.”Supporters of the Vermont senator, a self-described democratic socialist for more than 40 years, point to polls putting him ahead in next Tuesday’s Texas primary, one of more than a dozen states that will be voting on what has come to be known as Super Tuesday. An average of polls collated by RealClearPolitics puts him on 22 points, ahead of Joe Biden, 20, and Elizabeth Warren on 15 points.Meanwhile, another poll, conducted for the Texas Lyceum, a non-profit group, suggested Mr Sanders was the strongest Democrat\u0026nbspin hypothetical match-ups with Mr Trump, falling just three points short of him on 50-47. This compared to 51-46 for Mr Biden, 52-44 for Ms Warren and 51-43 for Pete Buttigieg.A victory in Texas next Tuesday would mark a major milestone and potential tipping point for the Sanders’ campaign, as it seeks to collect delegates and tie up the nomination ahead of the party’s summer convention.Yet a win in November would be little short of staggering. Texas is a major prize, with the highest number of electoral college votes, 38, other than California, where Mr Sanders also looks strong.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The last Democrat to hold a statewide office was in the 1990s, and the party’s last presidential candidate to win here was Jimmy Carter in 1976.Meet the Democratic women looking to turn Texas blue in 2020Demographic changes in places such as Houston have given Democrats cause to hope. The 2018 midterms saw the party pick up a handful of seats in the House of Representatives, and Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot challenge to Ted Cruz in the Senate race shocked both parties, even though Mr Cruz held on 51-48.Last year saw at least six Republicans from the House announce they were standing down, amid a so-called “Texodus”. Among them was Will Hurd, the only African American Republican congressman.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsppreviously reported on efforts to turn red Texas blue, driven in large part by large numbers of women candidates challenging for House seats, Senate races, and control of the state assembly, something considered a priority.Yet longtime Texan political strategists from both parties believe while Mr Sanders could win the primary, it would very difficult to beat Mr Trump there.Matt Mackowiak, president of the Potomac Strategy Group, told The Independent: “I think Bernie could win the primary. But if he’s the candidate in November, I think Trump will increase the nine point advantage he had in 2016.”He added: “I think Bernie Sanders will be radioactive in the suburbs, and that he will also impact down ticket races.”Matt Angle, a Democratic strategist and founder of the Lone Star Project, a political action committee that funds Texas candidates, said last year that\u0026nbsphe believes the party could win the state if it had the correct candidate and was willing to spend up tp $100m on political advertising. He said the best candidates would be Mr Biden or Texan Beto O’Rourke, who has since dropped out.Mr Angle said this week his assessment had not changed, and that he believed it would be hard for the likes of Mr Sanders or Ms Warren to win in Texas.“I think Bernie Sanders has a ceiling in Texas,” he said. “I’ve been doing Texas politics a long time and I’ve seen how you win here, and how you lose. You don’t win by thinking you’re suddenly going to have this mass of new voters.”He added: “We have been plagued by people\u0026nbspfrom outside of Texas, coming here and telling us how to win, even though they have never ran a campaign here.”Democrats in China to hold primary online due to coronavirus outbreakSuper Tuesday: When is it, and why does it matter?“This is the most consequential election in the modern history or our country. We are not only going to win in Texas on Super Tuesday, we are going to beat ‘em in November. We are not going to have Trump for another term,” he told supporters at the Vic Mathias Shores park in Austin.According to the Statesman, he added: “The pundits tell us Texas is conservative state. I don’t believe that for a minute.\u0026nbsp“And I believe that if the working people of Texas, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American stand up and come out to vote, you’re gonna make this one of the most progressive states in America.”He said: “The limitations of our imagination are the crisis we face today.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The development came as Tokyo\u0026nbspurged large gatherings and sports events to be cancelled or curtailed for two weeks to contain the outbreak, while still pledging that the 2020 Olympic Games would be going ahead in the city.In addition to the 186 cases reported by Japan’s government, there have also been 704 reported cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which was quarantined off Tokyo earlier this month.Seven people have died so far from the virus, including four people on the cruise ship.Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s health minister, said the central government would need to review patient lists and check on people who have been previously discharged following the second positive test.“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” Philip Tierno Jr, a professor of microbiology and pathology at NYU School of Medicine, told Reuters.“I’m not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,” Mr Tierno added, meaning the disease could appear to go away before recurring.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Police officers rescued the residents and escorted them to a nearby station for their own safety but, outnumbered, retreated as the vandalism of the mosque began.“Look at my home, the whole thing is burnt, as well as all our possessions – clothes, utensils – everything,” he said. “There were 11 of us living here, what do I do now? Where will we go?”Videos then went viral of men chanting the Hindu nationalist slogan “Jai Shri Ram” (glory to Lord Ram) as the mosque was vandalised and two flags, one of India and the other showing the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman, were hoisted on its tallest minaret.Due to confusion over the name of the neighbourhood, the Delhi police mistakenly said on Twitter\u0026nbspthat this mosque had not been targeted and that the videos were “misinformation”, prompting the major right-wing channel Times Now to run unquestioningly a prime-time segment denouncing the “fake” footage – and those sharing it – on TV.Yet the buildings around the mosque were still smoking when The Independent met with the Muslim victims of the attack on Wednesday, as well as the Hindu neighbours who tried to protect them from the mob of “outsiders”.Khursheed, who works driving a battery-powered autorickshaw, said he does not blame Hindus for what happened, but rather the heightened tensions created by the Modi government’s new citizenship laws. Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and a planned National Register of Citizens (NRC), discriminate against Muslims and threaten India’s secular constitution.He and other residents said they didn’t recognise the attackers.\u0026nbsp“I don’t know the people who came and did this – it is all just politics,” he said. “I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet seeing it gutted by fire was still not as painful as what the rioters did to the adjacent mosque.“We were targeted because we are Muslim,” she said. “All the shops belonging to Muslims were burnt, while none of the Hindu shops were touched. They want to single us out, to separate us from the other religions.”She said Hindus and Muslims in the neighbourhood had “never had any problems”.“We have always prayed together, Hindus and Muslims, in mosques and temples. We have always believed that we are all equal.”Like the other residents, Parveen says she bears no ill feelings for her Hindu neighbours, saying that when the mob first came from outside “they tried to save us”.I am just very sad for the situation my family is now inBut she says she doesn’t know whether the situation will calm down across the city after what happened. She is just thankful she wasn’t home to see the mosque attacked. “It is totally broken and burnt, we feel worse about that than what happened to our own homes. We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing.”A little down the road from the burnt-out mosque, shattered shop fronts and piles of debris, a group of Hindu neighbours watch the clear-up and are nervous about speaking to the media.Trump to press India PM on anti-Muslim law Labour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Death toll rises to 24 in Delhi riots with mosque set on fireModi on course for big defeat as Delhi rejects ‘poisonous’ campaignA 39-year-old man, who asked not to be named, said he welcomed prime minister Narendra Modi’s call for calm on Wednesday afternoon, but that it should have come on Monday.He admits the situation is “very tense”.\u0026nbsp“We have always been living together amicably here, there was no tension, we spent our childhoods together. Now these outsiders have come in and this has happened, and it is the people living here who have to deal with the tension.”He points to four armed police officers sitting outside the burnt-out mosque. “At least there is some protection now, but we were expecting it earlier. There should have been some procedure in place,” he saidFor some, though, the four officers provide little comfort. A Muslim man whose house across the road from the mosque was burnt, who did not give his name, said the violence had turned into “the most terrible outcome possible” for this neighbourhood.We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thingClearly nervous, he says he is only returning briefly to retrieve any key documents that – he hopes – may have survived the fire. “All the documents, all the possessions we have, we had to just leave them behind and just run for our lives,” he said. “If they are not there, how will I get a job?

We don’t like being treated as fools.If Harry and Meghan wish to be private citizens leading a quiet le in Canada, that’s fine. But that is not their ambition.By trading on their royal associations, they aim for global influence, wealth and fame. It is a goal that makes a mockery of all their protests about their need for privacy.When the Duke and Duchess first announced in January that they wanted to “step back” from public le, there was widespread sympathy for them.Their complaints that they struggled to cope with the limelight appeared convincing, particularly given Prince Harry’s admission of his mental health problems, fuelled by the trauma of his mother’s tragic death in .But that spirit of understanding is quickly evaporating as the couple reveal the full extent of their sense of entitlement and hostility towards the palace.In response to their ening catalogue of invented grievances, many Brits will be inclined to say, “Oh give it a rest,” or “good riddance.”Patience with the couple is at an end.The last straw was their outrageous reaction to the Queen’s decision that they would no longer be allowed to use the term “Royal” in their activities.This move was absolutely correct - the royal name is central to our national heritage.It is not a franchise to be exploited for personal gain, especially by a couple who have loudly proclaimed their determination to abandon their traditional royal roles.Before their wedding in May , they were indignant when the Queen rejected Meghan’s request for the loan of a certain tiara on the big day. “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” Prince Harry is reported to have said.But the Queen stood firm, just as she has done in the saga of the royal name.Her fully justied stance has pushed the spite and fury of the Sussexes to a new level, their anger made all the greater by the fact that they had spent thousands on their “Sussex Royal” website and merchandise.Their statements most notorious passage read, “While there is not any jurisdiction by the Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word Royal overseas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use Sussex Royal.Who on earth do Harry and Meghan think they are to scold Her Majesty in such a patronising manner The truth is that they are talking political and constitutional nonsense.The monarch and the government certainly do have the right to restrict the use of the word “Royal” throughout the world.Its deployment is covered by a range of legislation like the Trade Marks Act and the Companies Act, as well as a host of international treaties like the  Paris Convention on Industrial Property.But on a deeper, more personal level, the Sussexes’ outburst was a profound insult to Elizabeth II as both our sovereign and a grandmother.Having given her whole le to the service of her country, she did not deserve to be treated like this.Her own example of self-sacrice during her record-breaking  years on the throne is in dramatic contrast to the self-indulgence of the Sussexes, who gave up after just  months.For all their moans about their burden, they never gave royal le as a married couple a chance.Their contempt for the palace shone through other aspects of their extraordinary statement. They wailed that other members of the royal family have been allowed to “seek employment outside the institution,” a blatant jibe at relatives like Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.But the whole point is that Meghan and Harry are not looking for normal jobs.If they were, they would not make such a fuss about their royal associations.Instead, they are hoping to cash in on their positions. That explains why the statement emphasised that Harry is “sixth-in-line to the throne.Without any hint of irony, they also boasted of their wish “to continue to represent and support Her Majesty”, when in reality they have wilfully placed the monarchy in turmoil.But for all the exhausting melodrama they have created, they still expect to be bankrolled by the taxpayer when it comes to their security, whose bill could reach £ million a year.Tellingly, they gave no indication of when they wouldthe £. million paid for the renovation of Frogmore, their property on the Windsor estate.All their laments feed into their carefully cultivated narrative of victimhood - but this is another invention.When they were first married, they were shown tremendous goodwill by the public and the media.Indeed, Kate Middleton had to put up with far more criticism when she first entered the royal family, partly because – unlike Meghan – she did not have her own successful career, and partly because of her middle-class background as the daughter of a former air hostess.“Cabin doors to manual,” snobbish courtiers allegedly sniggered behind her mother’s back.Yet through her modesty, determination, and elegance, the Duchess of Cambridge has grown into one of the monarchy’s greatest assets.“All the film people in the world, had they scoured the globe, could not have found one so suited to the part,” said Prime Minister Winston Churchill in  when the radiant Queen Elizabeth ascended to the throne. The same words could be used today about Kate now.Meanwhile, the Sussexes could be in for a shock. The world may not share their estimation of their brands appeal.Meghan herself was never a major star, while Harry has no unique talent to offer, especially now that he has become increasingly peevish and humourless. Nor is the public in either Britain or North America likely to lap up tirades about poverty and climate change delivered by a virtue-signalling, woke couple with an enthusiasm for private jet travel and a burgeoning property portfolio.The row over the royal name could just be the beginning of their troubles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It.

As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say.

He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game. He has been arguing for decades about social inequality and its effects upon health.Fair enough. But this has given rise to headlines about evil Tories killing people. The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks.

As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere.

He got more than £million from the company.How about you give some of that money back to the child labourers, George You want to change the world, make it a better place Then enable those children to live dignied lives without back-breaking work all day.I’M proud to have signed up to Toby Young’s Free Speech Union, to defend our freedom of speech.I had to break a pledge of mine to join it.It’s Lent right now – the season of the year when traditionally you give something up. Well, I’d decided to give up donating to charities for a month or so. But happy to make a very noble exception. Never before in our democratic country has free speech been so under threat.It’s OK for gobby old tossers like Toby and me – we have a  to speak. But too often people are hounded from their jobs simply for expressing an opinion. Or barred from speaking at universities in case they upset someone.Or get a midnight visit from the Old Bill because they happened to like a joke about a transgender person.The fightback starts here. Later next month I’ll be visiting universities to unveil a Charter for Academic Freedom, drawn up by my political party, the Social Democrats. Nothing is more precious than the freedom to express one’s opinion.If it offends someone , my suggestion is: OK, sure, now get over it.He was very right-on, was Harvey. Had all the politically correct opinions. Much loved by the Obamas, of course.Always the way, isn’t it  The more a bloke tells you he’s a liberal and a feminist, the more women should reach for the can of Mace.I HAD a bowl of Alpen this week, for the first time in  years.My daughter’s just got a hamster and its food reminded me of the cereal I used to eat as a young teen. Came in a black box with a mountain on it. My mum bought it because she thought it looked posh and foreign.Indeed, I thought it came from Switzerland. It was actually made in Kettering, Northants.Anyway, I had a bowl of the stuff and couldn’t work out why it wasn’t as nice as I remembered.My Facebook friends told me it was because they’ve cut the sugar content. Probably that’s right.But isn’t it also that NOTHING tastes as good as how you remember it  Not Alpen, not Mars bars, not Monster Munch.And definitely not Heinz Sandwich Spread, which tastes to me these days like paint stripper.Have to say, the site seems to me to be run as a kind of grooming parlour for the benefit of middle-aged pervs. But it’s not just that. The longer your kids – and especially the girls – spend online, the greater their chances of developing depression and other mental illnesses.They also end up with a much shorter attention span. Because they spend their days swiping backwards and forwards in a nanosecond.If we’re to avoid rearing a generation of doolally morons, we need to ration the time they spend online.It’s down to us parents to do that – not the State and not even the companies who run the godawful sites.WAS out walking with the dog this week. Saw this weird thing in the sky.Kind of a yellowy-orange. Circular. Looked up a few moments later and it was gone. I had this feeling that I’d seen it before – a long, long time ago. But can’t put a name to it.When will this miserable weather end If you knew you were a bee, would you be happy  I’m not sure I would.One bee told me yesterday: “Bit of a downer, really.“Suddenly realised I’m going to spend my entire le carting loads of pollen back to some enormous idle cow in the hive.“I’d much rather be a wasp, frankly.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A Tory minister squirmed as he struggled to defend part-time PM Boris Johnson ’s refusal to visit flood-hit areas of the UK - despite finding the time to roll out the red carpet for billionaires at a lavish ball.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick was confronted with the Mirror’s front page, which urges Mr Johnson to “get a grip” on Sky News. Mr Jenrick insisted such visits were a “distraction” which took resources away from the emergency services. But there was an awkward silence as he refused to say whether Prince Charles’ visit to meet families in South Wales whose homes had been devastated by Storm Dennis had been a “distraction.” And he wouldn’t answer when asked why Mr Johnson visiting now would be a “distraction”, but it wasn’t when he visited flood-hit towns in November, during an election campaign. Brandishing today’s Mirror, host Kay Burley said: “This is getting out of hand, now. This is the Prime Minister, I’m sure aides have shown this to you this morning. “‘Get a grip, you drip’ - they’re saying ‘where are you ’” She added: “These people, who are up to their armpits in muddy water, are saying ‘where is the Prime Minister ’” He is very much in control of events. Over  of my constituents were flooded two weeks ago. What they are very concerned to see is action. They want to see more funding for flood defences, Mr Jenrick said.  They are pleased that the Government has activated quite a substantial package of financial support. Those are the really meaningful things which personally I think are more important than the distraction of the Prime Minister turning up in an emergency situation.” Ms Burley asked: “So when the Prince of Wales went, that was a bad idea, was it ” Mr Jenrick paused, before saying: “Well, well…the Prime Minister visiting a flood situation can take away quite a lot of resources. That’s often the advice that’s given to the Prime Minister.”  Despite the country facing two crises - flooding and the spread of coronavirus - the PM still found time to roll out the red carpet for millionaires and billionaires at a party fundraising ball. Unnamed donors paid almost £, for two games of tennis with Mr Johnson in an auction at the event, alongside hunting trips and luxury holidays. The party raked in an estimated £, from table fees alone, as  attendees paid up to £, a table to rub shoulders with ministers and dine on fine food and costly wine.

One passenger told Birmingham Live they were left feeling aposlike a prisonerapos while another said her aposheart sankapos at the news.Travellers - including families with young children - claimed they were not given an opportunity to leave the plane as they were flown to an airport , miles from home. They were put up in a hotel overnight and were expected toto Birmingham yesterday - but say Jet had aposfailed to communicate effectivelyapos. The airline said its teams were working apostirelesslyapos to get everyone to their destination as soon as possible. Passenger Helen Jenner said aposit should have been a th birthday to rememberapos - but instead she ended up stranded in Portugal. Helen told BirminghamLive: I understand the sandstorm was out of their hands - but the communication from the Jet office to the ground staff is appalling. We should have departed on Sunday, then Monday, then we were told it would be Tuesday. On Tuesday, we were picked up at pm and taken to the airport, which was manic. It took two hours to check in and cases were not weighed, just tagged. In the departure lounge there was not a seat to be had and no information on the time of the flight. At pm I was starting to lose my patience - no information whatsoever. I went to the Jet desk where again the front line staff were at the receiving end of customersapos anger. They did not know the situation either. At .pm our flight was called to board from Gate . At pm we boarded, but at .pm the pilot tells us aposnot good news folks - weaposre not going to Birmingham tonightapos. Passengers were groaning and my heart sank.  Due to the hours the crews had worked, they could not go for four hours - instead hotel accommodation had been arranged in Faro. We landed in Portugal at .pm and were herded through the airport through passport control to waiting buses. The hotel we were put up in was a -minute drive away, we got there at gone midnight - food was there but who wants to eat a meal at am  This should have been a th birthday to remember, instead it was spoiled by Jetaposs failure to communicate effectively. What are they playing at  How is this considered duty of care  Ruth Abbott - whose husband George was also among passengers on the same flight - hit out at Jet. She slammed the airlineaposs aposshocking lack of communicationapos telling BirminghamLive: George and his friend Daniel had been due to fly back on Sunday but their flight was delayed owing to the sandstorm. That was understandable and couldnapost be helped.  But since then, they have been given next-to-no information. Their flight was delayed until Tuesday, when they were eventually put on a plane and the doors shut - only for the pilot to tell them they wouldnapost be ing to Birmingham as he didnapost have enough aposflight hoursapos left. My husband said he felt like a prisoner on that plane. They were given no option of getting off the flight before it took off. Instead, all the passengers - which included families with young children - were taken to Portugal. They were put up in a five star hotel on Tuesday night - which was lovely - but the passengersapos luggage was all left behind in Tenere.George is without his blood pressure medication which is packed in his suitcase as he believed heaposd be back in Birmingham by now.Their lack of communication has been shocking.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA teacheraposs coronavirus-themed dinner date after she was quarantined in China has attracted a mixture of scorn and praise. Max Hemingway, from Dartford, Kent, and his we Loraine drank Corona beer, dined on coronation chicken, played the board game Pandemic and watched Contagion to help stem their creeping cabin fever. The married English teachers, both , and their -month-old golden retriever Jojo have lived under lockdown since the health crisis spread from its Wuhan epicentre to their far eastern city of Weihai in January. About three weeks ago, Loraine claims authorities placed barriers around their neighbourhood and stationed clipboard-clutching guards at the gates to monitor traffic in and out of the community. Their building manager handed out special passes that residents have to present every time they want to leave the barricade, and only one person per apartment can leave at a time. Eventhey were allowed to go out together, Max claims it would be pointless as all the bars, restaurants and malls are closed. So the couple decided to have a romantic night in aposCoronavirus-styleapos. Their selfies of the event went viral, amassing over , likes on Reddit with many viewing the stunt as aposhilariousapos. The feedback wasnapost all positive however, as many accused the couple of not taking the situation seriously and branded their joke apostastelessapos. Not everyone thought it was appropriate to make jokes about the virus, which has killed more than , worldwide so far.  One commenter said: People out here dying of [this] disease and these guys [are] making a night of it. Another added: This isnapost funny. People are dying left and right over there from that disease on both ends patients and doctors. Please grow the f*** up. But others were quick to defend the coupleaposs use of humour to deal with the distressing situation. One supporter said: These people are in far more danger of contracting the disease than you are, yet youaposre telling them how they should be coping with it. Dumb AF. Another added: Get over yourselves. Sometimes the only way to get through a terrying situation is to find the comedy in it. Did you miss the part where they said that theyaposre currently living in China  These two are at signicantly greater risk of getting infected by coronavirus than .% of the commenters here. Max, from Dartford, Kent, explained why they posted the photos. We were trying to laugh at the virus, he said. Not at the people who are suffering, but at the circumstance we find ourselves in. Loraine, who comes from Calornia, said: At the end of the day they donapost know the situation. Theyaposre commenting from afar. From a place of luxury I think at this point. They donapost know what it feels like to be cooped up at home, to have that fearyou go out or come into contact with something [that could be] contaminated.  I think we know how much we have contributed, to help out in this situation that weaposre in. I thinkanyone has a comment to say against it then thataposs their opinion. We took the picture for ourselves. They saw a snapshot but they donapost know anything . They donapost know what weaposve done, how we feel. Everyone in the community they live in is required to wear a mask and their temperatures are checked every time they go to the supermarket. The couple has tried to make a positive contribution in their province of Shandong, which the World Health Organisation said had  confirmed cases as of February . Over the past few weeks theyaposve solicited donations for medical supplies from the UK and America and volunteered with the Weihai Health Bureau designing awareness posters and doing translation work.  Recently, they tried to visit a friendaposs apartment but were turned away by security. Even the self-described aposhomebodiesapos have had enough of what they described as the aposlove lockdownapos. Loraine said: For us coronavirus is an hourly thought. Especially because of [our dog] Jojo. We take him out for walks, and every time we go outside we think, OK, be careful of what we touch. [We] donapost even touch the elevator button. So itaposs constantly in the back of our head how to stay safe, how to protect each other. Iaposm just very grateful to be in this situation with someone I love. Max and Loraineaposs whirlwind international romance began just before Christmas in  when they hit it off at a party aimed at foreigners in Weihai. Nine months later they were married.  Loraine said she did seriously consider leaving China when Coronavirus first hit. The couple had been visiting her family in the Philippine, and Max flew back a week early to take care of the dog. It was Jojo, Loraine said, who ultimately convinced them to stay. Without the option of a direct flight to the UK or US, it would be extremely dficult to leave with their beloved pup, who is also looking forward to the barricades coming down. Loraine said: Iaposd love to take Jojo on a walk along the beach. His normal routes.

Their childaposs primary school and a medical practice visited by the patient have both closed for deep cleans amid fears that others in Buxton could have been infected. Burbage Primary School alerted parents and carers in a text message, saying a parent had been diagnosed with the flu-like virus. About a mile away, Buxton Medical Practice closed as a precaution, with a voice message telling prospective patients to stay away. A video on Twitter allegedly shows the patient being whisked away in a convoy of emergency services vehicles at about .pm on Wednesday after being picked up by medics in protective suits. Have you been affected by coronavirus in Buxton  Email webnews@mirror. It came as Public Health England confirmed two more cases in the UK, bringing the total to . The other person was in a London hospital after catching the virus in Italy. In Buxton, it is understood the parent had recently ed to the town of , from Tenere after staying at the H Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, where four Italian tourists tested positive for coronavirus this week. Britons are among about  guests in a -day quarantine and there are fears the virus could sweep through the hotel like it did the Diamond Princess cruise ship while it was quarantined in Japan. Burbage Primary Schoolaposs head, Anthony Tierney, was on site to speak to concerned parents on Thursday morning. He confirmed that the gates would remain closed for the day. It is understood the school may not reopen until Monday at the earliest.  Mr Tierney said: We are shut, it is just a precaution. I canapost say anything more at the moment. Panicked parents took to social media after receiving the bombshell message which was sent out just before pm on Wednesday night. Many complained about the lack of a full explanation as to whether the infected parent had actually been on the school premises. The school, which has  pupils and  members of staff, gave no further details about the coronavirus victim. The message sent to parents and carers read: Due to a confirmed case of coronavirus amongst our parent population, Burbage Primary School will be closed as a precautionary measure to enable a deep clean to be completed.  “A further update will be shared tomorrow.” At first some parents thought the message was a hoax, which lead to hundreds of messages on Facebook and Twitter. But one parent posted: My daughter goes to the school. I can confirm that the school have put out the message to parents. They have also asked people not to post hysterical messages on social media. A parent criticised the online speculation, writing on Facebook: It may be precautionary and the parent may not have been on the premises but has a child at the school who has been exposed to the virus. The virus is transmittable before any symptoms are shown so to give no context or further explanation is irresponsible!!But another parent replied: What context is missing  Parent infected, their kids at the school. Virus can infect without symptoms early on. School closes to get cleaned. Whataposs missing  A dferent parent criticised the speculation about the seriousness of the situation before any further details were released. I feel for the staff and headmaster who will have to deal with the members of the public who are now worrying over precautionary measures, she wrote. Another replied: Why shouldnapost they worry  Itaposs contagious before symptoms show. If the parent has it then likely the child children do also. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Buxton Medical Practice said: We have a confirmed case of the coronavirus.  We are liaising with Public Health England and the CCG to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Please do not come to the practice.The practice later wrote on Facebook: Just a quick update to say we have talked to Public Health England and their advice is that we should be able to open tomorrow after a deep clean today. We are also advised that there is currently no need for additional testing for patients or staff. Thank you for your patience. Members of Derbyshire County Councilaposs emergency planning team were called into the authorityaposs headquarters in Matlock early to deal with the issue. A spokesman for the council said: We are aware of the reports and are awaiting confirmation from Public Health England.  We will release further information as soon as we get it.Local resident Zoe Milly Jones posted video on Twitter showing two paramedic vehicles with their flights flashing as the patient was taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital. Medics had stopped at a Morrisons petrol station to put on hazmat suits before collecting someone from a property in Buxton. Ms Jones wrote: Just followed two ambulances and two response units from Stockport, to Buxton on blue lights in convoy.. where men in Hazmat suits entered a property, and seemingly put someone in an ambulance. Then blue light convoyed back to stockport. Could it be #coronavirus in #buxton.She told : The first place I saw them, where I took the video was on the A, in Hollingworth.They turned right onto the A heading toward Glossop. I followed them the entire way, as it looked suspicious.The ambulances stopped on Morrisonsapos petrol station in Buxton at first.Where they changed into white suits. Then they moved onto the house in Buxton, where someone got into the ambulance.Then they convoyed back on blue lights again. I followed them all the way back. They went into a loading bay at Liverpool Royal Hospital. Another resident wrote on Facebook: Just Seen  ambulances in convoy coming from buxton way with lites but driving slow all staff at mask on anybody know why anybody know why.  Hailed as a gateway to the Peak District National Park, Buxton is set in north-west Derbyshire, about  miles south-east of Manchester. Residents were shocked when they found out that someone amongst them was infected with the disease. Lynne Gracie, who lives close to the primary school, told DerbyshireLive: “The news has left me gobsmacked. My thoughts and sympathy go out to all affected.It’s a popular school and has just had new classrooms.“I don’t mingle with the school community, I don’t have children but I can understand their concerns. It’s a worrying situation.” Ruth George, who represents Whaley Bridge on Derbyshire County Council, appealed for calm.  She wrote on Facebook: “It’s important that we don’t panic about the coronavirus, but we also need to do all we can to protect people. “Thank you to Burbage School in Buxton for taking sensible precautions. I hope that parents - and their employers - will understand the need to make sure this highly infectious virus doesn’t get spread.” Public Health England said the UKaposs two new cases involved a patient who ed from Tenere and a second who had been in Italy, where  people have died amid the worst contagion in Europe. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said: Two further patients in England have tested positive for COVID-, bringing the total number of UK cases to .

Nurses and paramedics will visit people with symptoms so they do not have to travel, reducing the risk of the Covid- infection spreading in the busiest period for medics. The scheme comes as more school pupils are in isolation after feeling unwell upon ing from Italy, where coronavirus has killed  people. And a business expert warned fears of UK towns going into a lockdown like in Italy could spark a stockpiling frenzy. Spooked mums yesterday spoke of stockpiling medicines, food, nappies, water and pet food online, including on the popular Mumsnet site. Ratula Chakraborty, professor of business management at the University of East Anglia, said: “With coronavirus cases increasing and quarantine measures being ramped up, inevitably some anxious households will begin stocking food, medicines and other storable essentials. “The prospect of towns being in lockdown and shops closed is heightening fear and stockpiling may become re.” Revealing the home testing plans, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “We now have testing sites at all AE facilities, as far as we know, across England. We’re also planning to introduce home testing and some of this has started already so people don’t have to go to the pods in front of AE.” Until yesterday, home testing was only being piloted in London.  Prof Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, said: “Many of the things we would do to contain the virus are also the things you do to delay the onset of an epidemic. If we are to have an epidemic, having the peak outside of the winter pressure season for the NHS is going to be a very big win for us.” Ministers are considering a worst-case scenario that  million people here could catch the bug and it could kill , – mainly the elderly and those already unwell.  On the Continent, a -year-old man became the first French citizen killed by the virus yesterday and a new case took the country’s tally to . Germany has been hit by new cases that can no longer be traced to the virus’s original source in China, Health Minister Jens Spahn said yesterday. Five victims were confirmed – taking its total to  and meaning the disease appeared to be moving to a new phase. Several European countries, along with Algeria in Africa, announced their first cases. Austria, Croatia, Switzerland and Algeria said their victims were people who had been to Italy. The news increased fears for Brits abroad after experts said coronavirus will be impossible to contain hereit sweeps mainland Europe. Brits are among  holidaymakers at Tenere’s H Costa Adeje Palace hotel, where four people tested positive, were told yesterday they will be trapped there for a fortnight. Schools in Cheshire, Nantwich, Huddersfield, Newquay, Truro and Middlesbrough have shut doors to staff and children who visited Italy as a precaution.  Cleeve Park School in Sidcup, South East London, advised pupils and staff to stay away yesterday after children fell ill following a skiing trip in northern Italy. And Ashcroft Technology Academy in Putney, South West London, sent home  students and staff just back from the country. Trentham Academy in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, and Corfe Hills school in Broadstone, Dorset, had two pupils each in isolation after visiting Italy. Authorities in Italy said on Tuesday night that the number of cases there had grown by % in  hours. Diagnosed cases have now hit . Next month’s Six Nations rugby clash between Ireland and Italy in Dublin was yesterday postponed amid the crisis. And England’s clash with Italy in Rome on March  is thought to be under threat.

Schools have been closed after pupils and staff ed from ski trips in Italy, sparking fears they could have caught the killer bug and brought it back to the UK. Hundreds of workers have also been sent home from a London office after an employee showed symptoms similar to coronavirus. Fears over the virus has led to hand sanitisers flying off the shelves nationwide and major retailers selling out of face masks. As many of us consider wearing the masks, especially in situations like our commute, an expert has revealed whether they will be effective in preventing you from picking up the virus.  Dr Jake Dunning, head of emerging infections and zoonosesat Public Health England, told The Independent there is aposvery little evidence of a widespread benefitapos in wearing the masks.Many of the paper options being worn do not filter out infectious air particles, and those that are not worn properly or are loose fitting will not prevent bacteria from entering your nose or mouth. Experts have also warned that the virus can be contracted through the eyes. Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also said there is little evidence the masks will help prevention, and are better used by those who already have the virus to prevent it spreading. Medical professionals who come into close contact with the coronavirus will usually be wearing more heavy-duty masks, which can filter out unwanted particles and are specically fitted to the weareraposs face.

Soraya Owen-Brown spent nearly three months bouncing from doctor to doctor as her distressed mum pleaded with medics to find out why her daughter was sickly.Last week Nikita Owen-Brown was given the news all parents dread - Soraya has an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour – a rare and aggressive brain tumour, Grimsby Live reports.She has also been diagnosed with hydrocephalus – a condition in which cerebrospinal fluidaccumulates within the brain. The nine-month-old is today undergoing le-saving brain surgery, followed by chemotherapy treatment. As a result of her daughter’s ordeal, Nikita is campaigning for “mother’s intuition” to be taken seriously by the NHS. The mum-of-four, from Immingham, north east Lincolnshire, said: “If one of those GPs had listened, just one, my baby wouldn’t have had weeks of pain she couldn’t tell me about. “The hydrocephalus may not have been so severe and her tumour would have been smaller. Soraya’s symptoms began in mid-December with a cough.  Nikita said: “I spent five-and-a-half hours in AE and was told it was probably just a viral infection.” However, almost two weeks on, her condition continued to worsen and a discharge started leaking out of her ear before she developed a weakness in her left side. Nikita rushed Soraya to the doctor who said her daughter probably had a “viral infection”. She said: “They couldn’t see her ear because there was too much debris. They swabbed her ear and gave us antibiotics and started us off with ear drops.  “They said there was nothing remarkable about her ear and it was just a viral infection.” But her “mother’s intuition” told her Soraya’s condition was more than just a viral infection. She added: “My beautul Soraya had been poorly for weeks. I had seen eight dferent GPs, some two or three times. “I had told each and every doctor: ‘She isn’t right, do something’. Every single time I was told: ‘She’s fine’ or ‘Viral infection’. “I think viral infection is clearly doctor speak for ‘I don’t know’. “Eventually, Soraya developed muscle weakness in her left side, stopped eating and regressed on her milestones. “Fast forward to now, my baby has a brain tumour and hydrocephalus.”Nikita wants a “mother’s intuition” to be taken seriously by the NHS so has launched a petition –  Soraya’s Law  – and has gained more than  signatures in under one week. The petition reads: “My aim is for mothers to be listened to and taken seriously, making a mother’s intuition a genuine diagnostic tool for the NHS. “There is not a person in the world who will know a baby like their mummy. “As a mother, it is impossible not to know your child inside out. We can read our children like books. “So when a mother is so convinced her child is poorly, why donapost doctors listen   “Donapost let your baby suffer like mine did. “There is no such thing as a apostext book babyapos and GPs need to acknowledge and learn from that. “Mama knows best.”A Go Fund Me page and public Facebook group called Sorayaaposs Army   have also been set up to support the family emotionally and financially through the ordeal."},{"url":null,"title":"greggs customer who dropped paper","story":"NewsGreggs customer who dropped paper bag after snack hauled to court  years laterGrace Firth, now a -year-old student from Stockport, had no idea that a tasty Greggs snack a decade ago had seen her convicted in her absence and she was forced to make a trip to court this weekShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  FEB NewsA quick snack more than a decade ago has come back to bite this woman \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mr Betts told LeicestershireLive: The first we knew about it was when we had a letter in several languages pushed under our door.

The horric encounter left victim Declan Bryan, , fighting for his le and he has since been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder , Lincolnshire Live reports. Shocking pictures show the extent of the injuries he sustained when he was assaulted by Alin-Ionut Apostu and Alexandru Mocanu in the early hours of December  last year in Lincoln. The former doorman was walking home after being out with friends when the pair sexually assaulted one of the women in the group. “We were coming home from a night out – there was myself, two girls and a male friend, Declan said. “We were walking down the street and I gave one of the girls my shoes and the other my jacket to help them walk home. “One of the girls was quite drunk so we had to pick her up and carry her, and in doing so her skirt rode up a bit. The first one touched her and then the second one did it. He told the men their behaviour was unacceptable in an attempt to peacefully defuse the situation.  But Apostu and Mocanu then lashed out at Declan and attacked him and the other woman who was in the group. I told them to f-off, that that was sexual assault and they could go to prison, he continued. “I tried to usher them away. I used to be a doorman, so I know how to dfuse situations. I didnapost become aggressive, I didn’t want any violence. I thought we had resolved it. He says the younger man then began to apologise and even shook his hand - but after starting to walk away, came back and punched him.  “He started walking away, then he punched me from the side. The other punched me from the front and that’s all I remember. The next thing I knew I was waking up in a puddle of blood.” He then blacked out but has since been told the pair aposused his head as a footballapos and that he was very lucky to survive. Apostu and Mocanu kicked and stamped on Declan’s head before Apostu knocked one girl unconscious when she tried to pull them off him. He then proceeded to sexually assault her while she was motionless on the ground - before karate kicking the other girl in the head.  When Declan woke up, he was surrounded by passers-by who had come to help him. There were people around me,” he said. “I didn’t know what was happening and how I had got there. “I woke up and was trying to make sure my friends were okay. Then I looked down at my feet and I was wondering where my shoes went. I was confused as to why there was so much blood.” Both men were jailed over the incident on Tuesday, February  at Lincoln Crown Court. Everyone that has seen the CCTV footage of the attack – the police, the barristers – has said I’m lucky to be alive,” Declan continued. They used my head as a football. My friend tried to stop them and they tackled her to the floor. It was disgusting and it was shocking to watch it back. Even being a doorman it’s one of the worst attacks I’ve ever seen without people using weapons. I couldn’t believe that anyone could do that to anyone when there was nothing to aggravate them. Declan - who suffers from a genetic disorder called Von Willebrand disease, which means his blood doesn’t clot as well as it should - says the attack could have killed him. I could have bled to death, he said. I had severe bruising to the face and my eyes. I couldn’t open one of my eyes for a while, I had a laceration to my left eyebrow which has scarred. The attack has also had a profound effect on Declan and his friendaposs mental health, and he has had to give up work and move back in with his parents in Friskney, near Boston. My family have been brilliant and my friends have been understanding with everything. I’m trying to relax with it all and trying to start again, he continued. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. I found it out the hard way – I tried to go back to work as a doorman and I started having a panic attack while on my sht. I had to be sent home and haven’t gone back since. I haven’t been able to go out, I haven’t been able to go into places with large crowds. I will need counselling. I already suffer from anxiety and depression so was on medication but I’ve had to up this. We’ve all been talking with each other to try and help each other through it. Apostu,  and Mocanu, , both from Lincoln, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the woman.

The former Hollywood actress allegedly complained to her closest confidants about the issue before releasing her extraordinary statement on Friday, complaining they are being treated dferently to other royals.Meghan said that [she and Harry] were left with no choice but to make a public statement, a friend told the Mail Online .  She saidanyone should feel insulted, it should be them. They never intended to capitalise on the word royal, and to insinuate they were somehow abusing their privileges is absurd. The Duke of Sussex is currently in Edinburgh for final engagements as a working royal before the official split in the spring, but the Duchess will not be travelling to Scotland and instead catch up with him in London.  The insider told the Mail Meghan has no issues about being in the UK after their aposabdicationapos following a bombshell statement in January revealing their desire to quit as royals.  The source went on to say: Meghan is going straight to London, not Edinburgh because thataposs Harryaposs thing.  She said she and Harry will continue to rise above jealousy and pettiness and focus on the good they are creating and on being the best parents to Archie.  She said she will continue to champion Harry because out of everyone, he has the most integrity and the most loyalty. Meghan also believes Her Majesty was under pressure to make those demands about the name change, as Harry is her favourite and others just canapost deal with it, the friend added.  Last week, the Queen banned them using the word aposroyalapos in their Sussex Royal aposbrandingapos with the Mail previously reporting Meghan had grumbled to friends there was nothing legally stopping them defying her.  The statement released in retaliation by the Sussexes, who could be set to make millions in foreign endorsements, said neither the Monarchy nor the Cabinet has jurisdiction over use of the word aposroyalapos overseas - adding, however, they would not be using the term.  While The Duke and Duchess are focused on plans to establish a new non-profit organisation, given the specic UK government rules surrounding use of the word ‘Royal’, it has been therefore agreed that their non-profit organisation will not utilise the name ‘Sussex Royal’ or any other iteration of ‘Royal.’ For the above reason, the trademark applications that had been filed as protective measures and that reflected the same standard trademarking requests as done for The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have been removed.

Workers at Stockport Village Nursery, now home to an incredible eight sets of non-identical and one pair of identical twins, believe their preschool in Stockport, Greater Manchester, is the only one in the UK to have ever looked after this many at once. They were amazed when they realised they had three sets of twins attending at the same time - and thought they were seeing double when six more later arrived, all from the same area. Weaposve always had a lot of twins but when we had three sets we were quite shocked so to have nine is something , says nursery manager Lyndsey Cross, . We must be the only nursery in the UK to have this many - weaposve never had this many at once before. The twinsapos ages range from five months to four years old - with Lottie and Gracie Catterall being the youngest of the lot. The others are Tobias and Arlo McHugh, two, Rey and Joanie Layton, four, Chloe and Emily Worrall, three, Archie and Ben Lowther, four, Elizabeth and Olivia Handby, one, Penelope and Grace McMahon, one, Sadie and Lottie Dean, two, and Sia and Ava Vivaldi, two. Steph Doxsey, who is mum to Lottie and Gracie and also works at the nursery, says she couldnapost believe it when the number of twins kept rising.  Itaposs crazy. Iaposve never heard of so many twins at a nursery, the -year-old said. Sometimes, because there are so many of them,they donapost come in matching outfits I donapost like it. When theyaposre all together, they just sit looking around at each other like theyaposre thinking aposoh, youaposve got a twin tooapos. To reduce confusion, each set of twins has been assigned to a dferent member of staff.  Although the youngsters often arrive in matching outfits, as they arenapost all identical there is thankfully no need for name tags. Thanks to a sibling discount, Lyndsey says the nursery have always had lots of twins, but previously their highest number at once was just three. We think itaposs quite funny and itaposs quite unusual. There must be something in the water, she continued. It can be confusing for staff but thankfully they arenapost all identical so we can tell the dference and one set belong to a member of staff.

Natalie Smyth, a university student in Dundee, was upstairs in the flat she shares with two other women when she heard a noise coming from the hallway. Assuming it was one of her flatmates, she shouted out and got no reply, so peered down the stairs when she noticed a strange figure in the hallway. A man, dressed in dark clothing, had put two Apple Macbooks and chargers into a bag and tried to make a swt exit when he had heard Natalieaposs voice. The -year-old from Inverness said: I was just out the shower, playing music and singing away to myself in my room but I heard some rustling coming from the hall. I thought it could have been one of my flatmates but as I stepped into the hall, called out the name of my flatmate, receiving no reply, and quickly scanned the rooms as it’s a small flat. I was momentarily confused - only until I noticed a shadowy figure by the front door fumbling around with some bags. It was dark so was hard to see but it was immediately obvious that this person was not one of my flatmates. Without a second thought, Natalie began recoding on her phone and raced down the stairs to confront the man, grabbing back her belongings as the man put up very little resistance while heading for the exit.  Natalie follows him out of the flat, telling the thief not to .He had let himself in after one of her flatmates had forgotten to lock the door behind them, and others hailed her nerves of steel when she posted the footage on Twitter to warn others.She wrote: Pls remember to lock your doors in Dundee guys.

The video has racked up more than , views, with one replying: Have you thought about joining the police ! You couldnapost have been more unbothered about confronting him.  Another said: Bloody hell! I’m surprised you were so calm! Natalie said: I have no idea what gave me the courage! When I’d ever previously imagined myself in this situation, I always assumed I’d either enter fight or flight mode and try to defend myself or lock myself in my room. But I suppose you can never anticipate how you will react in a situation like this until you’re in it. I wasnapost scared, surprisingly. I think my immediate response was to try to dfuse the situation as quickly as possible.  He was so close to the front door and seemed ashe was just about to leave anyway. I almost let him get away with the bag until it dawned on me that it could’ve contained some of our belongings. I had no idea the Macbooks were in there until after he had left but I wasn’t going to allow a stranger to leave with a bag of items belonging to us regardless of what it was. Natalie believes the man was simply an aposopportunist thiefapos and has since reported the incident to the police, but claims she hasnapost heard back.

Michaela Hide,  paid £ for the treatment claims the beautician injected her with the wrong chemicals. The customer services manager says she knew something way very wrong straight away when her lips started to swell. The beautician, who she later discovered wasnapost qualied, pumped her lips full of a calcium-based product instead of the usual hyaluronic acid based filler - which crystallised in her lips.She told the Sun : I looked like something out of a horror show.I looked horric. When my boyfriend at the time came home, he went berserk, screaming aposwhat have you done apos The beautician assured Michaela everything was fine, simply telling her to go home and put ice on her lips. However this didnapost work and she began to panic. Michaela also stocked up on antihistamine medication in the hope that it would reduced some of the swelling, but said it made no dference.   After some research she discovered the beautician had used a filler known as Radiesse which is usually used in chin, jaw, cheek and nose sculpting, not plumping the lips. With giant lumps forming everywhere, she was barely able to open her mouth.  Michaela went back to the beautician and paid an additional £ to try and even them out but was left looking and feeling worse than when she walked in. She claims the beautician then blocked her and moved house, after she kept asking her what she could do to ease the pain. Saying she was desperate to look normal, Michaela started looking for someone  who could fix the problem. She said: That’s when I really began to panic. I thought I was going to be stuck like this forever.  She ended up splashing out a further £, for two operations with reconstructive surgeon Dr Mark Gorman, who claims that heaposd never seen another case like it. Since the filler the beautician used is supposed to alter jawlines and noses, its made to stay twice as long as normal filler to mimic bone. This meant that when Dr Gorman tried to dissolve the filler, it had no effect on the lumps.

They complained about a lack of suitable food and essentials such as nappies, and claimed they were given little information over how long they would be contained there. The Foreign Office has been contacting Britons to tell them they will be quarantined at the four-star hotel until March . Some feared the containment would put them at greater risk of catching the flu-like virus, pointing to the situation on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where hundreds tested positive during a quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. Mandy Davis, who is at the four-star hotel with her husband Roger, told the Daily Mail: Nobody knows what the right thing to do is, because nobodyaposs had this virus before.  So please, letaposs sort something out, come and rescue us please, Boris. And letaposs just get the hell out of here. Guests have been given masks and thermometers so they can take their temperature twice a day. They went more than  hours without hot food - relying largely on sandwiches - until they were given a lunch buffet and Champagne on Wednesday.  Lara Pennington, , from Manchester, decided to stay put in her room and have meals delivered to her. Mrs Pennington, who is on holiday with her two sons and elderly in-laws, said: Itaposs very scary because everyone is out, in the pool, spreading the virus. Britons have told how they are trying to stave off boredom by getting out of their rooms, or by watching TV, surfing the internet and reading books.  The hotel was locked down on Monday after an Italian doctor tested positive for coronavirus. His we and two people who were travelling with them then tested positive as well. Guests found out about the lockdown when notes were slipped under their doors telling them to remain in their rooms. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are offering advice and support to a number of British people in a hotel in Tenere, and their families.  Our staff are in close contact with the hotel management and the Spanish authorities, have written to all British guests, and are in touch with anyone identied as vulnerable or in need. “Any British nationals who need support should contact the British Consulate in Tenere on    .” Back in the UK, a person understood to be from Derbyshire tested positive for the virus after ing home from Tenere.

The tour-bus guide from Osaka has become infected by the Covid- strain of the disease for a second time. Her falling ill confirms fears expressed by scientists that immunity caused by the disease could be relatively short lived. The woman’s second positive test came as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose by  to , in addition to the  diagnosed from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Dr Babak Ashrafi, from UK-based online doctor Zava, explained how it has been dficult to predict how the relatively new strain would act over time. Experts are busy gathering information from those who have become infected to see how well their immune systems react and how long they’ll remain immune, he told Online. We do know that when you catch a virus, your body learns how to fight it off. However, like our minds, our bodies can forget over time how to do this and immunity can wear off over time after initial infection. The fact people can get the disease twice in a fairly short period of times heightens the potential impact of the disease.  Already signicantly more than , people across the globe have coronavirus. The relatively slow spread of the virus in Europe at the beginning of February has now sped up signicantly. Hundreds of people are infected in Italy where multiple people have died. Countries including Austria, Switzerland and Croatia have all reported their first cases this week.  Two more patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to . One caught the killer bug during a trip to Italy and the other person had visited the Spanish island of Tenere, where about  Britons are in a quarantine. If the virus continues to spread as it has been for the past month then the viability of sporting events scheduled for this summer will be questioned.  Yesterday a spokesman for the Japanese government said the International Olympic Committee and local organizers are going ahead as planned with the Tokyo Olympics despite the threat of the spreading coronavirus. The Olympics are set to open on July  with , athletes competing. The Paralympics opens a month later and will see , compete.

We enjoyed Friday night and where the result leaves us but we’re back now and looking at the next one.“Dunfermline is about ticking off another three points. That’s the aim.“Not getting too high and not getting too low has got us where we are, so we knowwe do that we’ll end up where we want to be come the end of the season. vw, px\"  “From second place it’s a tough ask for anybody to come back from that deficit but we’re taking it one game at a time.“Friday night was a good one for us because we knew we had to be right at it.“We knew it was a big one for both teams but, luckily, we’ve come out on top.“It’s important we use it to spring ourselves forward again.“Any setback throughout the season we’ve bounced back to winning again and gone on a run, so we’ll be looking to do the exact same.“If you’re going to win the title, you want to do it as quickly as you can, of course.“As the games tick off and it gets closer and closer, people start predicting when it’s possible and things like that but inside the camp I think we do what we’ve done the whole season.“We take it from this weekend and the weekend after and just keep doing it like that until it’s mathematically impossible.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/DNic_Tele_Fball_Podcast-8-scaled-e1582122918392-940x547.jpg ","title":"poll the pusscat dolls appearing at slessor gardens is it a good act to attract","story":"Chart-topping American girl group The Pussycat Dolls are coming to the city this summer, for a performance at Slessor Gardens as part of their UK comeback tour.The pop group – featuring singers Nicole Scherzinger, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta and Carmit Bachar – will take to the stage at the Waterfront on July .This will be the first time the band, who ed to music earlier this month with their new single ‘React,’ will have performed in the city.What do you think about the girl group coming to Dundee Please vote in our poll below."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/g-and-f-union-street.jpg ","title":"popular dundee baker set to close doors of west end shop after 40 years","story":"An iconic Dundee business will be closing one of its most prominent shops after it was a fixture of the West End spanning five decades.Goodfellow and Steven, which has operated on the Perth Road, will close its doors for the final time this Saturday.The news comes after the company closed their Union Street store last month leaving many city centre shoppers shocked.Martin Goodfellow, sales and marketing director for the baker, said the recent closures did not equate to #doom and gloom# for the business.He added: #We are still running a number of premises in Dundee while also focusing on our wholesale operations.#The Perth Road shop had been running since the s but one of the main reason for deciding to close the premises was due to the lack of footfall.#The shopping experience in the West End has changed.#Mr Goodfellow confirmed the company owned the Perth Road and Union Street buildings before adding he was confident new occupants could be found for both sites.He added: #The Perth Road will still be a viable option for another type of business and we are quietly confident our Union Street store will be filled.#It#s certainly not all doom and gloom for the business.

Despite histo club management, O’Neill confirmed he would remain at the helm of the Northern Ireland squad until the completion of the Euro finals bid.O’Neill led Northern Ireland to their first-ever Euro finals qualication as group winners in . That achievement was surpassed when Northern Ireland qualied through the group stages to reach the last . Kennedy’s Aberdeen team-mate Niall McGinn scored in the - defeat of Ukraine in the groups to seal a first win for the country in a major tournament since shocking Spain in the  World Cup  years previously.Capped  times for his country fellow winger McGinn, , is a constant inspiration to Kennedy.He said: “Obviously Niall is here as well and he has played so many games for Northern Ireland. Niall is in the same position as me so I watch him day in, day out. Hopefully I can learn from Niall and try to get into the Northern Ireland team.“It is what every player wants, to play international football.”Former Everton winger Kennedy had initially agreed a pre-contract to join the Dons in the summer for next season.However, with the Dons struggling in the attacking third McInnes opted to move to secure Kennedy on a permanent contract during the winter window. He penned a three-and-a-half year contract on a £, switch from St Johnstone.Kennedy netted his first goal for Aberdeen with a header early in extra time of the - Scottish Cup fth round replay defeat of Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.He was not available because an ankle knock had ruled him out of St Johnstone’s Scottish Cup defeat of Morton, ensuring he was not cup tied when transferred to Aberdeen.After delivering his first goal for Aberdeen, the winger has vowed to follow that up with many more – and assists.He said: “I definitely want to bring goals for Aberdeen. I scored the most goals and had the most assists at St Johnstone before I left for here. I want to bring that to Aberdeen.”After extra time at Kilmarnock, Kennedy was rested for the - loss to Ross County. He was introduced in the second half against the Staggies, a loss that saw the Reds lose ground in the race for third. But Kennedy is sure the Dons will land a Europa League qualication spot. He said: “I think we will be third at the end of the season.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"customers-stuck-tesco-lift-two-hours","story":"TESCO have vowed to keep their Galashiels lt out of operation until a full inspection is carried out.The announcement

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride.

It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

The perceived wisdom that lsquothe greater the Tories obstruction, the greater the momentum towards independencersquo is a comforting soundbite for many. But it fails to take account of the fact that momentum and morale can also be disrupted and stymied. That is what is happening now.Todays problems are rooted in the way the SNP has related to Brexit for the past three years. Among a litany of failed initiatives, designed to satiate the independence grassroots, there has been a dearth of vision around the case for independence itself. Instead, it became obsessed with lsquostopping Brexitrsquo.This has led to the slow erosion between the SNP leadership and a large part of the wider movement. Nicola would appear at the Stop Brexit demonstration, alongside a whorsquos who of the British establishment, while independence demonstrations would get a tweet. Independence and the EU have become synonymous, to the extent that the whole project has become subsumed into ascending into the trade block.Electoral success cant mask the deeper strategic problems this has brought about. Many rods have been placed up the back of the independence movement. Does it now, for example, have a leg to stand on when there are calls for a confirmatory vote after a Yes vote  Even some independence supporting commentators claim that a Yes vote must hit sixty percentit is to be viable because of the lsquoBrexit shamblesrsquo. Others say independence will be nothing as chaotic as the Brexit. But this fails to acknowledge the institutional power of the British state, the City and so on, that will be wielded to impede and block the realisation of an independent Scottish state.And there is another problem being studiously ignored by SNP strategists. If independence has become what feels like a single issue campaign for EU membership, there should be a rock solid plan for entering the EU upon independence. Yet, remarkably, the Growth Commission, talked up as the negotiating position following a Yes vote, would inhibit EU membership because the proposal for Sterlingisation with the UK would leave Scotland without monetary policy autonomy, as the Growth Commission report admits.In  a former EU economic affairs commissioner said: \"As to the question of whether sterlingisation were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this simply would not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its one, and thus no necessary instruments for EMU.\"In the context of Brexit, the present proposal on currency is an even larger hindrance to becoming an EU member. The last three years should have, among a host of other things, normalised in the public mind an independent currency. Raise this matter, and you are met with a telling silence.The lsquoleave a light onrsquo sensibility evokes the EU as a moral force. But this forgets that it is above all  a trade bloc. One that has ruthlessly attacked wages, pensions and public spending. Between  and , the European Commission, made demands on suppressing wage growth  times, and on collective bargaining rights  times. The idea that the EU is a benevolent administrator of workers right is a myth. These rights have been won by the trade unions, who at the present moment are in a stand off with French President Macron, the shining new hope of the EU.The EU is not only undemocratic, in that its own structures are insulated from popular pressure and accountability, but also anti-democratic in that it erodes democratic structures of accountability where, particularly in member states. This doesnrsquot just include flashpoints like Catalonia, but its daily ing. It is likely to get less democratic ndash and more militarised ndash as the crisis of Western politics and the global economy intensies.The new commission to lsquodefend the European way of lersquo set up to deal with immigration matters, directly mirrors the rhetoric of the far right. Since the early s, , people have died attempting to enter fortress Europe. So we must dispense the notion that the EU will stand up for migrants. In  Nicola Sturgeon said, lsquoThere are , EU nationals from other states living in Scotlandhellip Scotland was outside Europe, they would lose the right to stay here. Post Brexit, this now needs to be turned on its head, with a new social contract for migrants guaranteeing their rights in Scotland regardless of EU membership.Brexit has been used as a means to win independence. But it is a blunt instrument. Yes, we have seen a rise in support since Brexit. But these polling spikes appeared straight after the referendum result, and after Brexit day. The much vaunted middle class No voters around which the whole strategy appears to have been built is a highly unstable cohort, opposed to disruption. Remember, too, that around a third of Yes voters have changed position since Brexit. Yes leavers are signicant, but ignored in the current approach.The logistical problems outlined here force us to revisit the basis of how we relate to the EU. This is a reality with which the national political debate in Scotland has not yet caught up. But it is also an opportunity to recast independence as a vision that can transform the fortunes of the working class majority in Scotland, and that can centre the need for new democratic institutions that can meet the challenges of the st century. Scotland has a chance to lead the way, but onlythe independence cause is promoted as something far larger than ascension to the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"free-bus-travel-under-18s-snp-green-budget-deal","story":"The package alsoincludes an extra poundm for local governmentand poundmfor the police.The deal comes ahead of a vote on Stage one of the budget for   tomorrow.Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the budget would increase support for young people, police, climate action and local government.Key elements include:ANational Concessionary Travel scheme offering free bus travel for s and under.The Scottish Government will undertake work on design and due diligence with a view to introducing such a scheme in January .Atotal uplt for the police service of poundmin the next financial year with poundmof additional investment in frontline services and a further poundmof additional capital investment, on top of poundmalready committedAnotherpound million of further funding for local government, taking total additional Scottish Government support for local authorities to poundm.A pound million package of investment in low carbon projects has also been agreed.MsMs Forbes said:ldquoI am pleased to have reached an agreement to pass the Scottish budget and deliver certainty for communities, businesses and our vital public services ndash especially in face of the uncertainty created by the UK Governmentrsquos decision to delay its budget.ldquoI want to thank all parties for the constructive way in which they have approached this yearrsquos discussions. While it is not possible to meet every partyrsquos demands in full, I believe in reaching formal agreement with the Green Party, I am also delivering on key asks from every party and I encourage all MSPs to consider giving their support to Scotlandrsquos budget.ldquoThis budget invests a record pound billion in health and care services, delivers Scotlandrsquos unique child payment to lt our youngest out of poverty, transfers pound billion of social security spending, supports our efforts to tackle the climate crisis and the creation of a Scottish National Investment Bank.ldquoThe Scottish Government had already backed Police Scotland with a budget increase of pound million. We will now increase that support to pound million overall with pound million of investment for frontline services.ldquoAnd we will deliver in full the support Cosla and others have asked for with pound million for local government.ldquoWe have made signicant investments to tackle the climate crisis, with funding for a green deal, low carbon travel and pound.bn of low carbon infrastructure.ldquoI will also increase funding for walking, cycling and safer streets to pound million for the first time and boost support for energy efficiency measures as part of our focus on reaching net-zero.\"When I presented the budget I said that every penny had been spent and that remains the case. In the absence of proposals to change spending, this additional investment will be funded through limited amounts of underspend, taking a multi-year approach to issues around non-domestic rates without impacting on local authority revenues, and additional consequentials from the fossil fuel levy.\"While this increases the financial exposure of the government it ensures that social security payments can be made and public services properly funded.In a tweet, Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoThe Scottish Green MSPs always work hard to achieve positive change, and in recent weeks weve been working for a budget deal which responds to the #ClimateEmergency and protects local services.Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoFree bus travel for young people is a transformational step towards tackling the climate emergency. This scheme will benefit young people starting college and families, some of whom stand to save thousands of pounds a year, and encourage whole generations of public transport users.ldquoBuses are the backbone of local public transport and the key to employment and training opportunities for so many of those starting out in le.ldquoYet again itrsquos the Scottish Greens who have engaged constructively in the budget process to deliver for communities in Scotland. Clearly, a Green budget would do even more to tackle the climate emergency, but securing this important free bus travel deal for the next generation builds on the powers we won for local councils to take control of local bus services. It is the Scottish Greens who are leading the change.ldquoAnd as we have done in every year we have struck a deal, the Greens have prioritised funding for local government, securing an additional poundm for libraries, schools and other local services.The Scottish Tories called the budget deal ldquoshambolic, and mocked the Greens for dropping their early demand to cancel new road projects.The Tories also queried the credibility of the concessionary bus scheme for young people, noting the Government had only committed to support it subject to further work.Finance spokesperson Donald Cameron said: ldquoWhile some of the measures announced are to be welcomed, this budget still falls well short of what our economy and public services need.ldquoItrsquos no wonder that the SNP has yet again tricked the Greens into supporting the budget, which is now becoming an increasingly laughable and humiliating situation for Patrick Harvie.ldquoTherersquos no commitment to free bus travel for young people, as the Greens seem to naively think, and the Green party seems to have dropped almost every other demand it previously made.ldquoUnless the SNP government commits to no further ergence from UK tax rates and adds an extra pound.m for drug rehabilitation beds, as well as properly resourcing the capital allocation to local authorities, we cannot support this budget.ldquoThe vague suggestion of lsquoreprofilingrsquo business rates will also set alarm bells ringing in Scotlandrsquos business community, and is something the finance secretary will have to provide clarity on.ldquoEveryone knew the pro-independence parties would leap back into bed together when it mattered ndash but the main losers of this shambolic coupling are people who rely on public services and businesses who keep our economy going.Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoIt is deeply disappointing to see the Scottish Green Party yet again sell our local councils, our environment and, indeed, themselves, short yet again.ldquoBy kow-towing to Kate Forbes, the Greens have given the green light to the deep cuts faced by local government and have entirely abandoned their call for an end to further infrastructure construction.ldquoMost galling of all is the Greenrsquos acceptance of a pale imitation of the call, led by Scottish Labour, for free bus travel for under rsquos by supporting the SNPrsquos promise to merely investigate the possibility of free bus travel for those under , meanwhile passenger numbers on public transport are plummeting.ldquoJust last week, the Greensrsquo Ross Greer said they would not support a budget unless it was a lsquoclimate emergency budgetrsquo. If this is a climate emergency budget, then I suggest Mr. Greer and his party reflect on their environmental credentials.ldquoAs ever, it is the young people of Scotland, our local councils and the environment that will pay the price for the Greens  minutes of fame.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoJust like last year and the year before the Greens have capitulated to the SNP Government, conceding their headline demands yet again.ldquoThis budget leaves the police with a shortfall of tens of millions of pounds and the hard-pressed service with real problems.ldquoLocal government capital is cut by poundm from its need. All this is to protect the budget for an independence referendum that no one thinks is actually going to happen this year. Yet the Green Party and the SNP are still putting money aside for it. People will be baffled by those priorities.Gavin Thomson of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ldquoScotland badly needs a shake-up in our transport system and, from the announcements so far, this budget agreement appears to represent a strong step in the right direction.ldquoExpanding free bus travel to young people, and an increase in funding for walking and cycling is recognition that our priorities on transport must change.ldquoThese positive changes could be easily funded by a halt to motorway expansion, on which we spend billions and only get more congestion and more emissions in .ldquoIn a climate emergency you must stop doing the things that are making it worse.ldquoTransport is our biggest polluter, making up % of Scotlandrsquos climate emissions, so transformative action is desperately needed.ldquoFree bus travel for those aged  and under is a great start to changing this broken transport system. Young people should be able to use public transport as default, instead of needing to buy a car to get around. Many of our essential services are free-at-the-point-of-use and public transport should be no dferent. This needs to be coupled with measures to discourage car use, to reduce congestion, improve bus journey times and reliability, and persuade commuters from cars to speedy, affordable bus travel.David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: ldquoFirms will breathe a sigh of relief that MSPs are set to pass a Budget in a timely fashion.ldquoWhilst not perfect, there is much within the Budget that retailers can get behind, in particular those aspects which keep down the cost of doing business and cost of living, during what remains a challenging time for the retail industry in Scotland.ldquoThe below-inflation uplt in the poundage rate, the lting of the threshold for the large business rates supplement, and the protection of ordinary taxpayers from rises in income tax rates, are very welcome and its encouraging that none of these measures have been diluted as a result of the accord with the Green Party."},{"url":null,"title":"steel-going-isnt-scottish-leader-joining","story":"Professor Jay is now doing similarly sterling work as the Chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse , whose latest report, on Westminster, was published this week. It is the likes of Professor Jay that give the notion of the great and the good a good name.David Steel, Lord Steel as he became, has been in the public eye far longer than Professor Jay, some  years. Former Liberal leader, ex-MP and MSP, Presiding Officer in the Scottish Parliament from -, the Scot is a pillar of the liberal Establishment in every sense. Or at least he was until this week.: Lord Steel quitsOn Tuesday a report by IICSA criticised Lord Steel for his failure to act over the paedophile MP Cyril Smith, despite knowing about the allegations against him.The report concluded: ldquo[Lord Steel] looked at Cyril Smith not through the lens of child protection but through the lens of political expediency.Following the reportrsquos publication, Lord Steel announced his resignation from the LibDems and retiral from the House of Lords.If it seems a small price to pay for what the report called an ldquoabdication of responsibility that is because it is.The manner of Lord Steelrsquos leaving did not do him much credit either. Although he condemned Smithrsquos actions, he followed this by accusing IICSA of using him as a fall guy because all the prominent figures mentioned in the report were dead.ldquoNot having secured a parliamentary scalp, he said, ldquoI fear that I have been made a proxy for Cyril Smith.There is nothing like departing with good grace, and that was nothing like departing with good grace. But then when it comes to ocean-going, copper-bottomed hypocrisy you have to go a long way in British politics to beat the Liberal Democrats. In this sorry saga it is not just Lord Steel who should be resigning.: Victims criticise party inquiryIn his appearance before IICSA last year, Lord Steel gave evidence about a meeting with Smith in . He had asked to see Smith following the publication of allegations about the MP in Private Eye.As the IICSA report said: ldquoIt is clear that Lord Steel assumed from what Cyril Smith told him that he had committed the offences reported in Private Eye yet he did nothing about it.He did nothing because the offences took place before Smith joined the Liberal Party and became an MP. They were therefore, felt the then party leader, nothing to do with him.But the IICSA report was devastatingly clear on this point: ldquoThis failure to recognise the risk that Cyril Smith potentially posed to children was an abdication of responsibility by a political leader and an example of a highly placed politician turning a blind eye to something that was potentially troublesome to his party, with no apparent regard for criminal acts which might have occurred or for any victims, past or future.Lord Steel, who later recommended Smith for a knighthood, now says he had trouble hearing the questions at the inquiry and denies that Smith told him the Private Eye story was true. Yet as the inquiry said, he could have corrected his evidence at any point but did not.It was after he gave evidence that Lord Steel was suspended by the Scottish Lib Dems and a party investigation began.A short time later, without waiting for IICSA to report, the party lted the suspension and welcomed Lord Steel back into the fold.: Steel has whip restoredGiven the damning conclusions of the IICSA report, one has to wonder how rigorous this party investigation was. What evidence,any, was taken from others about what Lord Steel knew or did not know when Smith was alive When the suspension was lted, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Party leader, said Lord Steel had claried his initial IICSA evidence and as a result the party found no grounds for action. Why did Lord Steel not offer that same clarication to IICSA itself  What was the clarication Mr Rennie said on Tuesday that it was ldquoright that Lord Steel had resigned and would retire from the Lords. If this was an acceptance by Mr Rennie that the IICSA report was correct, then it is also, by implication, an admission that his partyrsquos inquiry got it wrong.In which case one wonders why Mr Rennie, who bears ultimate responsibility for the party investigation, is still in his job.The Lib Dems would clearly like everyone to accept that with Lord Steel gone from the party and the Lords there is nothing left to see here, and that we should all move on.But that is not good enough. The party needs to explain in detail why its investigation came to the conclusion it did.If it does not, then the public would be justied in thinking that Lord Steel had his suspension lted for no better reason than a General Election was widely held to be in the offing, and the party wanted to put a lid on the matter.The Lib Dems are never slow to accuse other parties of hypocrisythey think the occasion demands it. They are accustomed, by dint of their size and distance from power, to not being subject to as much scrutiny as larger parties.But now it is their turn to answer some dficult questions and they should do so without delay.The best way to start putting matters right would be to reopen the party investigation, and at the same time review internal inquiry procedures. Otherwise, what chance do future inquiries have of coming to the right conclusions Judging by his statements this week, Lord Steel feels himself hard done by, ill served after more than half a century in public le. He should instead be directing all of his sympathy towards the victims of Smith, none of whom will ever receive the justice they deserve."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-scots-living-unsellable-homes-post-grenfell","story":"THOUSANDS of Scots are living in properties they cannot sell as a result of post-Grenfell cladding issues.MSPs heard apartment blocks in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee are among those affected by ldquozero valuations, with particular hotspots around harbourside developments.It comes after mortgage lenders adopted new safety standards in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire in , which caused  deaths.In recent months it has emerged some flats are now being given a ldquozero survey valuation due to the materials used in their construction.Keith Denholm, director at Allied Surveyors, said thousands of properties will be affected across Scotland.He added: ldquoBut the bottom line is, we do not know until such time as an inspection of a building has been undertaken.Properties affected are often blocks built in the s onwards, but Mr Denholm insisted: ldquoWe donrsquot know the extent of the problem.He was giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Local Government and Communities Committee, which is probing the issue.Mr Denholm said homeowners are being left ldquoabsolutely in limbo and ldquohigh and dry.He said a remediation fund has been set up to help some of those affected in England and Wales, and called for similar measures in Scotland.Brian Smith, a partner at Simpson  Marwick solicitors, said the problem is still ldquorelatively new and first emerged in September.But he warned it could begin to have a real impact on Scotlandrsquos property market.He told MSPs: ldquoScotland was kind of affected first, because the home report is carried out pre-marketing of a property, unlike south of the Border.ldquoSo it became more apparent, but that time of year the market starts to drop off anyway.ldquoEstate agents will generally be telling clients to wait till the start of the new year before they bring the property to market.ldquoSo really, wersquore two months into the new year and I think this is where wersquore going to start to see all these issues coming round.ldquoAnd the problem is the zero value for mortgage purposes clearly is a problem ndash but the biggest problem any market has is uncertainty.ldquoBuyers in particular donrsquot like uncertainty, so itrsquos not just around whether they can get their funding ndash even cash buyers looking at a property that may have a cladding issue, the advice to them is not going to be to buy it without knowing very clearly what that problem is, and what the potential liabilities for remediation will be.ldquoSo until wersquore in a point where there has been some comprehensive evaluation of the extent of the problem, and some understanding of what the remediation path is going to be, I think the market is going to continue to be affected by these uncertainties and have dficulties.Elsewhere, chartered building surveyor Phil Diamond said it was ldquocrazy that combustible materials are still being used in Scotland.Scottish Tory housing spokesman Graham Simpson said: ldquoIt is astonishing that we do not yet have an immediate ban on combustible material in cladding, as in the rest of the UK ndash the SNP government must introduce this as a matter of the utmost urgency.ldquoIt is not right that properties are being built here to a lesser standard of fire safety than in England Wales, and then owners canrsquot get mortgages. Itrsquos a crazy situation. With regards to the issues preventing mortgage valuations on property with substandard cladding, the Scottish Government must immediately convene a working group of key stakeholders to solve this problem in Scotland.ldquoThey should also work with the UK government to ensure Scots homeowners arenrsquot being penalised for the increased protection in the rest of the UK.ldquoThe Scottish government must consider setting up a remediation fund to help people who now face potentially ruinous bills and keep people safe.But housing minister Kevin Stewart said it is ldquosimply not true to claim Scotland has set lower standards than the rest of the UK.He added: ldquoScotland set higher standards for external wall cladding systems last year, with the trigger height for non-combustible cladding reducing from m to m in all new high rise domestic and non-domestic buildings. We have also set a higher standard for cladding systems on assembly buildings, entertainment buildings, hospitals and residential care buildings of any height, with the exception of small buildings.ldquoMortgage lenders - who are independent bodies - introduced a new requirement concerning cladding and oversight, which we remain very concerned about.ldquoWe understand the anxiety that homeowners will be experiencing due to this issue , which is why we have repeatedly urged the UK Government to resolve it urgently as regulation of the mortgage industry, alongside insurance issues, is a matter reserved to the UK Government."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-pupils-no-longer-best-uk-reading-comprehension","story":"The largest literacy study ever conducted in the UK, written by Professor Keith Topping from the University of Dundee, has revealed that Scottish pupils are now joint second in terms of their level of reading comprehension ndash on a par with England and behind Northern Ireland.The What Kids Are Reading Report analysed the reading habits of , Scottish pupils, as well as a further . million young people across the UK and Ireland.The study analysed the dficult of the books children were reading and the level of pupilsrsquo comprehension.

To explain this, Mr Mackay delves into the psychology of the Scottish voter, citing a recent switch from performance judgment to a sense of identity, or the need to \"belong\", which the SNP is providing with its unequivocal stance on matters such as Brexit, the EU and, of course, independence. I think this, while perhaps true within itself, misses the dominant factor, which is that no one  is perceived as capable of providing either good government or a clear identity.Politically speaking, Scotland is a de facto one-party state since there is no effective opposition the SNP has the votes, and has even boosted its share, giving votes to prisoners and foreigners, reckoning that in gratitude they would favour those who provided them. In this, the SNP was backed by the Greens, who would support anything in exchange for \"green\" measures, and the LibDems, who probably supported the move as a matter of party doctrine. The Labour Party also backed it despite it being against their best interests. Why is beyond me.Ms Sturgeon, I think, is caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, the hard place being the intransigent refusal of London to even consider Indyref, and the rock being the uncompromising demands her own base of hard liners, who seem impervious to reason. On independence, Mr Mackay says: ldquoShersquos teased the base with independence for years in order to keep power. Now her more headstrong and ill-considered colleagues want to get on with it, come what may. A grubby political assassination of Sturgeon would be the beginning of the end for the SNP. Not necessarily. Without Ruth Davidson at the helm, the Tories will be lucky to hold on to their current share, so until Labour provides a viable opposition, psychological analysis of voting patterns is interesting, but somewhat moot. The SNP has it in the bag for now, and will continue to do so unless Labour starts to put up a fight.Jim Robertson, East Kilbride.NEIL Mackay is quick to point out the many supposed failings of the SNP while in government. His main beef appears to be that the SNP should stop its \"obsession\" with independence and concentrate on health, education and the like He states this as though independence is simply some arcane side issue. The reality of course is that its only with independence that Scotland will have access to all the economic and constitutional levers that will enable the changes that Mr Mackay hankers after. He also singularly fails to provide any clues as to what measures he thinks should be taken to redress the \"woeful\" record of the SNP. For instance, which titans in other political parties does he envisage righting all of Scotlands supposed wrongs Philip Maughan, Portree.NEIL Mackay in his brilliant article does not hold back in his exposeacute of the SNP: ldquo...hardcore independence supporters will cut the SNP any amount of slack when it comes to scandals and mismanagement because itrsquos the only vehicle to get them what they want.It is understandable that the SNP ldquoman in the street in his quest for some sort of misguided emotional freedom would disregard any ldquoscandal and mismanagement of his party to achieve what he wants, despite huge economic and financial catastrophe. And we read about SNP mismanagement on a weekly basis, failing our children, failing our old people, failing the poor, failing our economy and much, much .How is it then that SNP MPs and MSPs, apparently sensible, responsible representatives of ldquothe people of Scotland are prepared to accept and perpetuate these ldquoscandals and mismanagement when they know the ldquopeople of Scotland are being damaged so badly  This is a question for all those who are wavering about their voting intentions should there be another referendum. This SNP regime is fine with scandals and mismanagement because its leaders and supporters could not care less.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.NICOLA Sturgeons idea of a Scottish visa is an own goal for Scottish independence campaigners.

Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said: “Facebook may be happy to shut its eyes to abuse but it can’t close its ears to the unanimous concern shown by international experts.“Mark Zuckerberg has a choice whether to allow sexual abuse to soar on his sites or listen to those from all over the world asking him to rethink how to implement encryption without putting children at risk.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils urged to be safe and seen when cycling","story":"Pupils who cycle to and from school across Aberdeenshire are being reminded they need to be safe and be seen during the winter months.Although it may be starting to become a little brighter in the mornings and afternoon daylight is lasting that bit longer, Aberdeenshire Council is encouraging both children and their parents to remain focused on safety at all times.There have been some reports of youngsters riding to school without appropriate lights or even cycle helmets which has given real cause for concern.It is illegal not to have lights on your bikecycling in the hours of darkness and there is no specic time set each day as the surroundings play a large part in light levels.As soon as the sun has set, cyclists need to ensure they remain visible with lights as well as reflectors.In order to ensure pupils can continue to enjoy their healthy ride to school, the council is urging parents to make children as visible as possible in these low light conditions.Councillor Gillian Owen, Chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Education and Children’s Services Committee, said: “We must stress that when riding at night, the law states you must always use a working white front light and red backlight, plus a red rear reflector.“Sadly, we have heard of instances when pupils have been attending school – some on new bikes they received at Christmas – without the appropriate lights. Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families. While we might be seeing a bit more daylight at the moment, winter weather can often darken very quickly and lights on bikes are essential to ensure a child’s safety.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Elyza Fraser Mausoleum is one of the current NESPT projects\"  New directors appointed to local heritage trust board viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"stephen to hold 24 hour charity pt athon","story":"An Inverurie-based personal trainer is holding a -hour fitness event to raise funds for a charity which supported his sister.Stephen Hart, of Hart Fitness, will run fitness classes throughout the day and night on Saturday, February  in aid of CLAN Cancer Support.The personal trainer was inspired to raise funds for CLAN after his sister, Lauren, turned to the charity for support following a breast cancer diagnosis.Lauren, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, accessed CLAN’s services in Inverurie including counselling and wellbeing therapies.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Exceptions would include charges that are set by legislation.OIC’s funding allocation from the Scottish Government for the year ahead currently amounts to £. million. This includes £. million in funding for Orkney’s inter-island ferry service. But this is still to be finalised, with the council seeking ferries funding of £ million for  # .Council Leader James Stockan said: “This has been a challenging budget setting process. Fair funding for our inter-island ferry service is still to be agreed and, once government commitments and ring-fenced funding is taken into account, there is a real terms reduction of . per cent in the support the government provides towards the running costs of core council services.“Our annual funding from the government, on a like for like basis and without ferry funding is, per head of population, £ less than Shetland’s allocation and £ below the allocation for the Western Isles. If Orkney was funded in the same way as the Western Isles, we would receive up to £. million more each year to deliver council services.“A great deal of thought and effort has been devoted to finding ways to lessen the impact on our community, our staff and the organisation itself. But we are having to recommend a range of cuts to services that are valued by people in Orkney. These are dficult decisions to make.”The measures recommended by the committee would result in a reduction of the council’s workforce by the equivalent of . full time equivalent posts.Of these, one full time equivalent post is currently vacant. For the remaining posts, the intention would be to avoid compulsory redundanciespossible and look instead at alternatives such as redeployment, voluntary redundancy and retirement.The committee also recommended that a contribution of up to £. million should come from the Strategic Reserve Fund to support services during the year ahead.The committee’s recommendation that Council Tax bills in Orkney should increase by . per cent from April  is agreed, it would result in an overall Council Tax income of £. million during  – .The committee’s recommendations go to a meeting of the Full Council on Tuesday, March ,  for further consideration.If approved, the following Council Tax charges, in the table below, would apply in Orkney for the year ahead.Households with only one adult living in the property will continue to receive a discount of  per cent on the charges detailed above.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday. vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lewis-insulation-stairs-1-web.jpg","title":"lewis couple made to feel like complete idiots over botched insulation","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineJulie Child and her we Rachel live in North Shawbost on Lewis where they also run a small café. In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce. Mrs Tymelly, played by Bereen who first had the role in the Lyric in , isof everyone’s secrets as well as one of her own.The actress is no stranger to London, but much has changed since she first travelled there: “I worked in London in the s as a nurse – I did midwery in Beckenham Maternity Hospital, a good bit south of the centre. Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in .

In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future.

The declining performance of the health service has been blamed in part on the staffing crisis.Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland, last night said the figures demonstrate why nurses felt it necessary to strike in December and January.The latest nursing vacancies for December of last year come as no surprise to nurses in Northern Ireland, she said.Over the past year nursing has consistently had the highest level of vacancies among all staff groups working in health and social care services.According to the figures, the vacancy rate in nursing posts had fallen slightly in December - down from , in June  to , at the end of the year.However, the number of empty nursing support posts has more than doubled between March  and December last year, from  to .Ms Cullen said she was concerned by this and said the figures reinforce the need for the Health Minister to act urgently to address shortages across the nursing profession.The figures have also highlighted startling shortages in other NHS services.There were  empty social worker posts at the end of last year, compared to  in March , while health bosses were trying to fill  domiciliary care worker posts in December. At the same time, the figures show health bosses were trying to recruit  allied health professionals - up from  in March .A spokesman from the Department of Health said it is taking a range of actions to reduce vacancies, both in the short term, for example, international nursing recruitment, and in the longer term, including implementation of the Workforce Strategy which was published in May , increased training commissioning, and efforts to ensure that HSC is an employer of choice.It is clear, however, that there are no quick fixes, and sustainable, multi-year funding is required, together with service transformation.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland grammar school pupils suspended for #repulsive# video mocking people with Down#s syndromeVideo: Car slams through hedge landing in garden of Co Antrim homeThousands in Northern Ireland lose benefits in transition to PIP system Met Office issues further Northern Ireland snow and ice warningDUP#s Donaldson to chair Westminster briefing with minister who branded LGBT education #state-sponsored abuse#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But we#ve only had about two or three. The volume has dropped drastically because factories in China aren#t back to full production, and that will definitely have an impact on the supply chain. Normally we#d be taking full loads of things like curtains or sofas from China for shops in Northern Ireland but they haven#t come.He said a delivery expected on February  would now be delayed until March . Chinese factories shut down as part of an effort to contain the virus and those in regions less badly hit by the virus are ing to production.Mr Burns said he has worked in shipping for  years but that the coronavirus had had the worst impact of any public health crisis. I remember SARS back in  and it wasn#t as bad as this, he said.Northern Ireland exported just under £m in goods to China during , the most recent year for which figures are available. Machinery and transport equipment made up around one third of yearly sales. Around £m in food and animal products were also sent in .Mark O#Connell, the chief executive of global trade advisers OCO Global, said the crisis will lead companies to reduce their reliance on China for supplies. They might switch to more domestic suppliers but not everyone has capacity to do that, he said. But there#s no doubt people will look to simply their supply chains to reduce their dependency on China.And he said exports of food to China would face delays getting into the country#s ports. In the case of beef or pork, that will be frozen, so as long as they keep the refrigeration going, another week at sea won#t destroy it, he said.But he said insurance was unlikely to pay out for consignments which were spoiled or where orders were cancelled, as a public health crisis is likely to be classed as a force majeure.And he said companies in Northern Ireland were also likely to take a hit from the spread of the virus in Italy.Italy is an important supplier in composites and aircraft, and to anybody in aerospace or advanced manufacturing, he said.

There have been calls for the Department for Communities to improve the PIP assessment and decision-making process after the figures were revealed. It shows those making claims for PIP waited on average  weeks from registration until when a decision was made on their case. PIP is designed to replace Disability Living Allowanceand is designed for those aged  or over who have not yet reached state pension age.The disallowance rate for the DLA to PIP reassessment exercise, where a decision was made on whether a claimant should continue to receive a payment, is %. It is %‘Rising ’ cases are included, classied as child DLA cases that are reassessed for PIP when the child reaches age .A spokesperson from Law Centre NI said: “The waiting times for claims of Personal Independence Paymentis obviously critical because we are talking about supporting people with a disability. [We] welcome the fact that the most recent clearance rates for PIP claims have reduced since August , but there remains signicant concern, most notably the work that is being done to make sure the decision is correct.There were , registrations between June  and November , , of which were cleared for payment in that time period. It means a Department for Communities decision maker determined whether the claimant should be awarded PIP.They show , PIP payments were made in November . There was a % award rate for new claims that month. The Law Centre spokesperson said: The most recent statistics again show the continued low number of successful awards. We know from other evidence that around one third of appeals are successful, which points to a problem that needs to be addressed. This means looking at getting the decision right first time and looking at how the mandatory reconsideration stage of the process is working.It#s after the transition from DLA to PIP was completed following on from when it was first introduced in June . This is now the definitive position as DLA to PIP reassessment has now completed, said Head of Policy at Advice NI Kevin Higgins. For me this is a big issue. We believe that the Department needs to do more to improve the PIP assessment and decision-making process.The highest proportion of those figures, % or , of all claims for payment, were due to a psychiatric disorder as the main condition resulting in a decision to claim for PIP. Meanwhile, new figures show , households, or , claimants, were on Universal Credit in November.On average, households received £ in payment per month. There were , households on the scheme but not receiving payment, most commonly because their monthly earnings exceeded the threshold for an award.The Department for Communities has been asked for a response.

Gerry says the tour is an ideal sounding board for new material.“The best way to try these out is to practise it, try it live andthey go down well, then you know it’s a goer.“It’s hard to get everyone together with everyone’s busy schedule but we’re looking into a few older Clancy Brothers songs while trying to keep a modern twist.“And also,we try to start writing stuff again, that would be good too.”For now, the focus is on this weekend’s gig in An Carn, but anyone misty-eyed for the raucous nights at the Hatfield may have to curb their enthusiasm.“For theatre gigs, everything has to be the finished product,” says Gerry.“You can’t be going on singing too many rowdy Pogues songs – but we love being able to do both settings.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A row of terraced houses at Wapping Lane, close to the Fountain estate, have lain empty for a considerable number of years. Those properties are amongst , that are sitting empty across the Derry and Strabane council area. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive , says empty properties are a “wasted resource” for the owner and those looking for somewhere to live. “Vacant homes can deteriorate and become a nuisance for people living close by. They may also lead to neighbourhood decline,” NIHE added. googletag.cmd.push Potential benefits of bringing an empty home back into use include generating rental income to offset rates and the costs of maintaining the property, releasing capital from the sale of the property and protecting the long-term investment potential of the property. In addition, it reduces the risk of vandalism, squatting and anti-social behaviour, and liability for health and safety issues, or damage to adjoining properties. When planning permission was granted to convert the iconic former Sinclair factory building on Abercorn Road into  apartments, the proposal also involved the conversion of seven vacant terraced dwellings along Wapping Lane into  apartments. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA for Foyle, Gary Middleton, told the Derry News that it is vitally important to develop this street. “I do want to see this area developed, it is my personal preference that they be kept as houses because I’d like to see more families move in to reinvigorate the area. In conversations I’ve had with the developer they have been positive about the possibility of houses. “I know parking was an issue, but I would encourage the developer to work as quickly as possible as it is in their interest to see them developed also.” The Foyle MLA said that homelessness figures show the need for housing in the city. “You don’t want to see any area sitting in derelictionit can be avoided. “It would also bring development of the streetscape which would complement the work that has already been done on the Abercorn Road – Wapping Lane needs to be part of that. “It would avoid problems with anti-social behaviour and environmental issues which have emerged while the properties have been vacant.” People Before Profit Councillor for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, said it is “unacceptable” for so many houses to remain unoccupied. He believes that many housing units are being “turned over to Air BB” to take advantage of busy periods in the Derry calendar. It proves a lucrative business for property owners, he said, and means they don’t feel the need to let them out for the rest of the year. Cllr McCann is of the view that Stormont must implement a “crash programme” of house building for the Derry area and NI as a whole. “There is a serious shortage of housing, particularly rental properties for young people.” He suggested giving the Housing Executive powers to build again by using the , properties in its ownership as collateral to borrow money against. Councillor McCann supported development at Wapping Lane, adding: “The need for housing is as great as it was  years ago. Derry was the spark for progressive movements in the past and it must be again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But before you know it little ‘Mary’ is three years old and you only ever see her at Christmas or on her birthday IF you have time and even then she doesn’t really know who you are.Yes you are working, yes you have your own children, yes you live an hour away etc etc BUT what happened to all those good intentions Good intentions are all well and good, butyou don’t actually do anything well they don’t actually mean anything - it’s the old excuses… could have done, would have done, will do, next time, but in fact you HAVEN’T, DIDN’T and DON’T!I love spending time with my nieces, and my great niece too. I’ve one of them to pick up at twelve o’clock today and I KNOW after she goes home I’ll be hoovering up glitter and sequins for weeks!But when I do collect her, see her as she runs to the door shouting ‘Aunty Jen’ and gives me a huge hug and big smile it makes all the glitter and sequins worthwhile, oh and all the laughing and smiling we’ll do together helps as well! It’s fab being an aunty, and I’m sure it is being an uncle and a godparent too, we can spoil them, treat them, play silly games with them - even have a go on the see saw and slide.We can enjoy going to the cinema and watching the new Disney films, visiting the farm or zoo, making popcorn and snuggling on the couch to watch cartoons, getting messy with paint , dancing around the living room and jumping on the couch to get away from the crocodilesand as they get older doing hair and make up, going on go karts or swimming - great excuse to go on that new slide in the swimming baths .There’s loads of fun to be had together so simply put,you don’t have your niece, nephew or godchild for a visit regularly YOU are the one missing out! Of course I’m not suggesting you should have them every week, every Saturday night .But maybe once every month, six weeks or couple of months for a sleep over - they’ll be so excited.I knowyou’ve got children and so has your brother, sister or friend that this may be hard for you, but maybe you could swop children for the day - then you’ll all get a chance to be that fab aunty, uncle or godparent.Or have your children and your niece, nephew or godchild too - what dference is one more child going to make.Yes parents this means you would have a babysitter but you’ve got to do it for your brother, sister or friend too! As I write quite often, their childhoods go by so fast, it’s the time with you today that creates the bond between you both - this does apply to aunts, uncles and godparents too.As our children become teenagers sometimes they need this ‘other’ trusted and loved adult in their le too - someone to talk to when times are tough, someone to be ‘on their side’, someone to help them make the right choice, a place and person of safety when things are going wrong.And this is what you promised when they were just a baby… ‘I’ll always look out for you, be there for you and be there to help you enjoy the world’.But how will they be able to do thisthey don’t know you, don’t play with you, have days out with you, or sleep overs at your house and only see you at Christmas - evenyou do bring great presents Anyway got to run, off to pick up my niece, take her to McDonald’s for lunch, then the cake shop so she can choose a special cake tor us to share after our tea, then it’s home for glueing, glitter, sequins and paint, before playing Snap, dolls and hairdressers, after that it’s be a bath bomb bath for herthen snuggles with stories before bed!No I won’t be telling her Dad about the sweets and ice cream - it’s my job to enjoy, love AND spoil her! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Of course attentions will turn thereafter to the retention of the National League and All-Ireland crowns garnered by Galway last year, whatever the result. It’s been busy but when the medals are piling up and you’re two from two in major Finals at Croke Park with another to come, all in the space of a year, complaining isn’t the first instinct. The Camogie success hasn’t protected her from real le - the final year commerce student has an interview for a Masters course next week – but it is a wonderful distraction. googletag.cmd.push Spellman was promoted to the Senior ranks with Galway by Cathal Murray. Though the boss is a clubmate, who was player-manager when Sarsfields last one the Senior Hurling Championship in  – her brother Eoin was involved – her performances atomised any notions of favourable treatment. Besides, Murray made it clear that reputations meant little to him and gave opportunities too to Caitriona Cormican and Catherine Finnerty. “It has been kind of surreal looking back on it” Spellman admits. “To start off in Intermediate and then make the breakthrough to Senior. And then starting in the All-Ireland Final was the pinnacle of my career so far. googletag.cmd.push “You would always dream of making a Senior breakthrough. Starting off the year at Intermediate you would try and build yourself up through the ranks and try and make a name for yourself. But it all happened last summer thank God.” Finnerty went on to excel in the All-Ireland decider following the cruciate knee ligament injury suffered by Tara Kenny  days before. That means Kenny misses out for Sarsfields too but she remains an influential figure in the camp and is targeting ato action in the summer. “Poor Tara Kenny, she is so unfortunate to miss out two times in Croke Park. But she is geeing us on. She is a massive character on our team going back  years. She is one of the leaders. You would look up to her. Her and the likes of Niamh , they are the older ones.” Spellman, who turns  in June, was a newcomer when Slaughtneil got their three-in-a-row run underway against Sarsfields in  . It finished - to - the following season. The experience should help. Certainly last September will. “It will be bringing back some good memories from then alright. I also remember the first Final with the club in  I remember feeling when you ran out onto the field, you were so young. You couldn’t really prepare for it, the feeling of the first time playing in Croke Park. The nerves got to us that day playing Slaughtneil. Hopefully we settle more and get over the right side of the line Sunday.” The  decider took place at St. Tiernach’s Park after the initial fixture fell foul of the weather. “Orlaithgot injured in the warm-up and Niamh pulled her back the week before theFinal. She was in awful pain. She wasn’t able to play but she started and lasted  minutes. She was the fulcrum in midfield. So it is good to have her at full fitness.” McGrath’sto the Galway ranks, along with sisters Orlaith and Siobhaacuten, will certainly boost the Maroons’ shot at history – retaining an All-Ireland title for the first time. “They are massive additions. The skills they have. Orlaith is lethal in the forwards, Niamh with the workrate in midfield. Siobhaacuten is lethal too. When you play against her she is like a snake she goes in through you. She is so small. Every ball into her hand and she is thinking about hitting the net. She is hard to stop. “There will be a lot of competition. It will benefit the team.” That is the type of philosophy that encapsulates Spellman’smodus operandion the pitch. She beavers away, chasing, harrying, challenging, happy to get dirty in the trenches and for others to emerge with the headlines. It is thoroughly Spartan in philosophy and action. “I go back a bit, trying to help. We have a lethal full-forward line to get the ball into. So you’re trying to win the ball and get it in. “It doesn’t matter who gets the scores as long as we win the match. Managers want the best for the team so you do what they ask you and you work hard.” Certainly,it is to be third time lucky against Slaughtneil, they will need to battle like never before. “They have such athleticism and fitness. We were taken aback nearly the first year. They ran us off the ground. Hopefully in the last few years we upped our strength and conditioning with Kevin Ward doing the running. Hopefully we can prove ourselves this year. We have the skills so hopefully it all comes right on the day.” For an extensive preview of Sundays final, grab a copy of this weeks County Derry Post.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead.

In these opening minutes, BRA did enjoy a sustained period of play in Down High territory, but the home town defence was watertight.Back at the other end Ben Gibson was unlucky not to get points when he was adjudged to have been held up over the line after a period of play close the BRA line.Finally, around  minutes into the half, the pressure turned into points with Joe Charles driving over from short range for an unconverted try.It was the second half before Down High added to their tally. This time the pack provided the  with a very convincing driven maul.Having driven towards the BRA line at great pace, the referee felt the BRA infringement to stop the maul was so stark that he marched under the posts, awarding Down a penalty try to take the score line to -.With a reasonable buffer, the local lads did lt their foot a little off the gas.A few BRA replacements made a big impact and in a relatively short space of time the North Belfast outfit had scored two converted tries, giving them a - lead.With  minutes to go, Down, now chasing the game, had to produce something special. And that they did.Winger Jonathan Graham was the player to touch down, reaching out to score on the back of some great work in the maul by the dominant Down pack.The conversion attempt from out wide fell short leaving Down with a slender - lead and around six minutes of play left.The closing exchanges were tense with BRA making their way into Down territory on a few occasions, but a few vital pieces of defensive play saved the day, one of these being a crucial turnover from replacement David Corrie.The refereersquos final whistle on the back of a BRA knock-on was greatly welcomed by the large home support.Down have now drawn Bangor Grammar in the semi-finals mdash a side they have both beaten and lost to earlier in the season.Down High School Belfast Royal Academy SUBSIDIARY SHIELD Q FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Legislation.jpg","title":"Legislation welcomed on review of road running  ","story":"A REVIEW of controversial legislation governing road running events has been welcomed by two local politicians.The Department of Infrastructure is to review new rules which place a financial hurdle in the way of running and other sports clubs organising events on public roads which have to be closed, hitting them in the pocket.The new legislation governing the administration work associated with road closures to allow events to take place in safety left organisers potentially paying as much as pound,, but local politicians worked with Newry, Mourne and Down Council in a bid to keep costs to a minimum.Road closure orders for events were previously free, but the new legislation removed this concession and in addition to impacting on running and sports clubs, the new law also applies to community groups organising fun days which require a section of road to be closed.The government departmentrsquos review of the new legislation has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Ms Rogan said the legislation placed a ldquodisproportionate financial burden on road running events while Cllr Devlin hoped the review agreed by Stormont minister Nichola Mallon will lead to ldquopositive change.Ms Rogan said the new law on road closures meant that a number of road running events cannot keep up with the costs of traffic management.ldquoFewer events are applying for closure permits as a result of this change and, most recently, this affected the Dark Hedges half marathon in Antrim, she explained.The MLA added: ldquoMy Sinn Fein colleagues on the Stormont Infrastructure Committee raised the need for the legislation to be amended so this burden can be lted from organisers, particularly those of smaller events.ldquoThis one size fits all approach for road racing traffic management is impacting on local communities. I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process. I encourage all interested groups, many of whom I have worked with since my election, to take part in the review..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 MLA.jpg","title":"MLA calls for urgent action to sort Ballykinlar centre power supply  ","story":"THE provision of electricity to the new Ballykinlar Community Centre must be sorted immediately, South Down MLA Colin McGrath has urged.The SDLP man said he was unhappy at a delay in getting a supply to the council facility revealed in last weekrsquos Down Recorder.The new centre has been ready since Christmas for organisations like the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Group to use.However, a committee meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council were told that a power connection problem was holding up the occupation and predicted it could be a longterm issue.The committee heard that electricity provider, NIE Networks, was having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to work on its land to install the mains supply.The long-awaited community hub is provided through the use of a prefabricated building, previously used by NI Fire and Rescue Service, and is sited on the former Kindle Primary School grounds in the village.A temporary solution of providing power through a generator was suggested by a council officer after a proposal from Slieve Croob councillor Kathy Mason, which was seconded by Downpatrick councillor John Trainor.Mr McGrath said the community in Ballykinlar had been waiting for the facility for decades.ldquoAfter years of work and representations the hopes of locals were dashed when the old school was torn down, even though it would have been an ideal building for a community hub. However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon. This is welcome but not ideal.ldquoApparently, there are some dficulties with the Ministry of Defence in securing the correct wayleave permission toenable electricity to be brought to the building. I have written to the Ministry and to the Northern Ireland Office and asked that this situation be sorted immediately.He urged: ldquoThe community must have its proper facility and it must be able to open properly.ldquoI hope the administrative issues can be sorted and this matter brought to a swt conclusion the community enabled to have the centre it has desperately wanted and needed for so long.The MoD last week indicated its willingness to work with NIE Networks to reach an agreement.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the Ballykinlar area and is pleased to support the development of this centre.A spokesman for NIE Networks outlined the connection process and said that once payment had been received by the council last October, it proceeded to undertake a site inspection and started land ownership investigations.The spokesperson added: ldquoOnce we identied the owner of the land a wayleave agreement request was issued and the process is moving forward as normal. Once the wayleave agreement is in place, work to install the connection will begin.A council spokesman said: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council is unable to comment on the discussions between NIE and the Ministry of Defence, but will continue to liaise with both parties to progress the completion of Ballykinlar Community Centre.ldquoRegarding a temporary supply of electricity, the council is exploring a range of temporary options to supply electricity to the centre and cannot provide a timescale at present..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Patrick.jpg","title":"Patrick leads Newcastle team to victory  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC are the new undisputed NI and Ulster senior cross-country champions.The race ed to Ulster University at Coleraine for the first time in several years on Saturday and Newcastle AC secured the title for the second grime in five years.The club won the title back in  and they were intent on stopping City of Derry from winning for the fourth year in a row.This year again the bus of lsquomaybesrsquo turned into a bus of lsquodefinitesrsquo and  runners and lsquoone hanger onrsquo set off for the north coast, or at least almost to the north coast in typical February wintry conditions.First up were the three women who travelled and it was such a shame that there wasnrsquot a fourth runner, for surely the women would have been destined for senior team medalsthey could only have found one more volunteer con.Shalene McMurray is notorious for her fast starts, but she settled in sensibly into the pack early on.The women had three times of the k lap that included a bit of climbing along with mud, mud and more mud mdash hardly any firm going on the course at all plus a gale that would cut anyone in two mdash tough conditions where only the tough would prevail.Emma Mitchell, these days running for Clonlfe Harriers, pulled away and won with relative ease in :.

Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof.What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.“The project has been designed to be sustainable on many levels. The materials used are durable, traditional materials. The oak used for the roof is from a sustainable source.”The minister added:“Heritage forms a key component of our tourism economy.

Leviticus : says to afflict your soulsIt is clear that Jesus commended fasting when speaking to the disciples’ I would never discourage fasting, but only the religious concepts applied to it, such as the ‘Lenten denial’ that Mr Hardy says is a feature of Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant groups and traditions. It is still man made traditions that Jesus said make the Word of God of none effect.Letter to the editor \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It is the purpose behind fasting and the motive within one’s heart that Jesus linked into when He referred to it. In Matthew  He warns not to ‘be like the hypocrites ... but when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to be fasting, but to your Father’. In the Land of Israel there is a national annual fast for  hours on the Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, where the whole country comes to a standstill, with no shops or restaurants open, television andradio not broadcast, and even no cars on any roads.This is one example of ‘when’ people fast, and not ‘’.Lent, despite the fact that Jesus never instructed us to copy His suffering and temptation, is much more a ‘token’ fast, often with skipping a meal, giving up chocolate, cigarettes or alcohol, as opposed to the Biblical examples of abstaining completely from food and water for an extended time. Leviticus : says to ‘afflict your souls’.What other nation on earth, other than Israel, honours God on such a national scale, or on an annual basis, unless they are going through some major crisis, such as was the case of national prayer in the UK during WWII  There were still cars on the road however! Lent may expiate the soul for those who find it beneficial, but unlike in Leviticus, we are not commanded to keep ‘Lent’ by God or Jesus.In the case of the epileptic boy’s healing in Matthew  Jesus informs the disciples that their lack of a result was because “this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting,” which demonstrates that there often has to be a practical reason for fasting and not just by habit.Colin Nevin, Bangor "},{"url":null,"title":"united unionist convention not what unionism needs time ","story":"Seven men arrested by PSNI investigating rape allegationNI snow alert worse than originally thought - Met Office issue second NI weather warning within  hoursNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionLettersA United Unionist Convention is not what unionism needs at this timeThe loyalist Billy Hutchinson has proposed a United Unionist Convention.By The NewsroomThursday, th February , : pm\"\"Billy Hutchinson, second from left, and other loyalist and unionist leaders at he Unionist Forum, set up in  due to the loyalist flag protestsBut that is what we always did, back in the day, and it is way too late for that. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
