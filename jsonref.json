But I was able to get back in and finish the filming. And afterwards I felt elated.As anyone who has had a panic attack knows, the only upside of the nightmarish ‘am I actually going mad?’ midst of the attack itself is that once it subsides it can give way to an almost euphoric high.After that, panic attacks became regular visitors in my life. After a month or two of these episodes, it was my mother who diagnosed me. She said she’d read an article about panic attacks and thought that was probably what was going on with me.But what to do about it? The triggers seemed to be any situation I felt I couldn’t walk away from without being conspicuous.Tube carriages when the train suddenly stopped in a tunnel caused immediate panic. This paranoia increased the panic and I’d be sent spiralling into a shortness of breath, the craziness in my head and an inability to get a proper grasp on the passing of time.Other panic-inducing situations included things such as meetings with my record label, where we’d sit in a boardroom with the door shut.But the biggest and baddest of these situations was live TV.Eventually I thought to myself: Enough, I need to sort this out.The most popular route to help with panic attacks seemed to be hypnotherapy. This was the first therapy I’d ever tried – for anything – and I was a bit wary.The initial session – with a very well-meaning practitioner – did nothing for me. She put on calming music and told me to lie still and relax, which sent me straight into the beginnings of an attack.After that, a friend told me about someone who had been treated by the hypnotist Paul McKenna.He’d become a regular fixture on TV and claimed he could change your life. I wasn’t sure whether he could really help me but I got in touch and trotted along to his place in Kensington, West London.We spoke about the triggers of my anxiety and about other situations when I’d felt that way.He said to imagine that I was standing in a room, and in the corner there was a television with a black-and-white image on it. The image should be an image of me from when I first remembered feeling out of control.I thought back to when I was little and my mum and dad had split up, and all the fights over where I would spend the time, especially when there was an uneven number of nights to be shared.The image I saw was me standing there at around the age of six while my stepmum explained how Dad was feeling about not seeing me as much as he’d like to.While she spoke, I felt incredibly guilty and out of control.The pressure was too much and I didn’t want to hurt anyone or upset anyone. I simply didn’t know what to do.Paul listened and told me to get closer to the screen and then let the image turn from black-and-white to colour.‘Now step inside the image. Climb into the scene and speak to that little version of yourself. Tell her you’re now an adult, that it’s OK she didn’t know what to do, and that you’ve grown into a happy grown-up so she doesn’t need to worry. It’s all going to be OK, and you can tell her that.’I did what he said and shortly afterwards I walked out of Paul’s house in a daze.I had been completely awake and aware throughout the session, but boy, was it powerful. For the next two or three days I could remember so many details from the time I was around the age of six or seven – things I had long forgotten, sights and smells. It was bizarre, but it really worked.Since that time I’ve had the inklings of a panic attack – the occasional little tug – but never again has it bloomed into a full-blown thing. Whatever Paul said to me that day, in just one session, was incredibly effective in giving the power back to me. I’m so grateful to him. Especially amazing was the fact that he never charged me. He told me to make a contribution to charity, instead, which I did of course.Pretty cool, that.© Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 2021Abridged extract from Spinning Plates by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, published by Coronet on October 7 at £16.99.

It will then be a drier and brighter day with spells of sunshine.The unsettled weather will return on Thursday with outbreaks of rain spreading eastwards during the day before turning heavy and persistent. Friday will bring another wet day with thick cloud cover and spells of rain which will be heavy and persistent in the south.Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: \u0027We are about to see a big change, and after the milder weather we have seen through September, autumn is about to break down the door.\u0027Low pressure from the Atlantic will move in next week with plummeting overnight temperatures next week bringing a small chance of frost to the highlands of Scotland.\u0027We are watching out for fireworks in October which threatens a particularly active season of storms and ex-hurricanes coming in from the Atlantic.\u0027Mr Dale added: \u0027I would expect a pattern of stormier weather to start revving up in October.\u0027The jet stream is about to move south and this will bring more of an influence form the northern Atlantic.\u0027Summer ended with a soft landing thanks to an extended mild weather in September, but October threatens a very different scenario.  \u0027This is something to keep our eyes on and it is a case of watch this space.\u0027As the weekend approaches, periods of heavy rain are expected in northwestern areas, with gale force winds in the far north at times. "},{"url":null,"title":"UK control Go Aheads Southeastern rail franchise","story":"Share this article\u0027We need the Government to dump the failed franchise system, end the profiteering of the train operating companies and take over the whole thing, lock stock and rails. \u0027It\u0027s a total scandal that Govia is now being investigated by the serious fraud office over millions of pounds of public money and yet they are still running Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) - the government must immediately bring GTR services into public ownership.\u0027Taxpayers must be reassured that public money is not being squandered and that they have zero tolerance of fraud.\u0027It comes after the Government in May unveiled long-awaited reforms of the country\u0027s fragmented railway network, including a new centralised price and reservations system.By launching a new public body, Great British Railways, whose name has echoes of nationalised British Rail in the previous century, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s government has already begun to take greater control of the sector.But it insists that the new route taken is not equivalent to renationalisation of the railways - a sector that continues to be hit hard by the pandemic depressing passenger numbers.Britain\u0027s rail tracks are already in state hands but the trains are run by mostly private companies enjoying large government subsidies.And since privatisation of the sector in the mid-1990s, the taxpayer has been forced to take control of financially-struggling franchises.Should the government eventually hand the running of Southeastern back to a private company, it will meanwhile not be under the franchise system, which was scrapped a year ago for new contracts.Private rail operators are still paid management fees for running services but now face tougher scrutiny and greater state involvement. "},{"url":null,"title":"EU truckers say UK government needs offer LONGER work permits","story":"Share this articleShare this article Under an emergency government plan, key workers could be given \u0027priority access\u0027 to a number of petrol stations.

This was done by Tony Blair\u0027s government during the 2000 fuel crisis. Some areas have already seen bin collections cancelled, and teaching unions have warned that schools could need to go back to online learning if teachers cannot drive to work. After a dizzying 24 hours of dithering over the use of soldiers to plug the HGV driver gap, ministers agreed to put the Army on standby. It is hoped that panic-buying will ease this week to reduce pressure on fuel supplies. But if the crisis does not abate, ministers will trigger \u0027Operation Escalin\u0027.About 150 military tanker drivers were put into a state of readiness under the operation, sources said. Some of them will receive further training in the next few days to be able to deliver fuel if required. The operation, originally conceived in case of a no-deal Brexit, could potentially see hundreds of troops brought in to help.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last night announced that army tanker drivers were being put on standby. He tweeted: \u0027Today we\u0027re asking army tanker drivers to be ready to deploy.

Here are the main points: This is clever because it exploits the slogan used by some Black Lives Matter supporters in the police. Tony Blair said in a New Statesman article this could be “the left’s most damaging political slogan since ‘the dictatorship of the proletariat’” because it implies all leftwingers want to dismantle policing, and some Tories cited this as a reason why they would not support footballers taking the knee. But Thomas-Symonds is seeking to make it stick to the Conservatives, not Labour. That helps to explain the Police Federation statement released last night. (See 2.28pm.) Normally the Police Federation would feel more at home at a Tory conference, and Apter would never have turned up to a Labour event just to listen to a speech by Diane Abbott, Thomas-Symonds’ more leftwing predecessor. To have him here is a clear sign that the party is repositioning itself on law and order. Yesterday Apter met Sir Keir Starmer on a visit in Worthing. Here is my colleague Rajeev Syal’s preview of the speech, based on what was briefed overnight. The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers and which is not normally particularly well disposed towards Labour, released a statement overnight welcoming Thomas-Symonds’ plan to boost neighbourhood policing. John Apter, the federation’s national chair, said: Asked if Labour was more ided under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Ashworth said: Asked if he agreed with calls for health workers to get priority at petrol stations, he replied: He said Sajid Javid, the health secretary, should work out an agreement on this now. He went on: There was a particular cheer when the right to food one was passed. This said that the right to food should be enshrined in law, to clarify government obligations on food poverty, and that Labour should include this in its next manifesto. Delegates also passed a social care composite calling for a national care service that would “ensure care workers are paid at least in line with average wages (now £15 an hour)”. This is the first motion covering a £15 per hour minimum wage being debated today. This afternoon a second one on workers’ rights, proposing a statutory £15 per hour minimum wage for all workers, is being debated.They had a coffee at the Hilton hotel this morning. Ellman announced yesterday she was returning to the Labour fold. Patricia Hannah-Wood, from Pendle CLP, said that on Sunday evening, shortly after a debate that covered antisemitism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination, she was abused.  Hannah-Wood said Labour had its own anti-bigotry policy, and it should be enforced. The motion says transgender people “face substantial barriers and experience high levels of exclusion and violence through persistent transphobia” and says Labour should “assert trans people’s same rights for self-determination as anyone else, and fight for measures to improve protections and services”.The allegation that there was some sort of plot has been made unattributably by senior Labour officials, and also by Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, this morning. (See 9.24am.) McDonald had been due to appear at the same Stop Fire-and-Rehire fringe event, but Barry Gardiner, the former shadow international trade secretary, said McDonald had chosen to return to London instead. He said: Ashworth said Labour would cut waiting times and “fix social care with a plan as far-reaching as Nye Bevan’s plan for the NHS”, partly focused on using personalised care to enable people to stay at home for longer.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIreland has been named as the best country to be in as the world lives with the pandemic, topping the Bloomberg Covid Resilience Ranking.The news agency noted in its monthly ranking that Ireland had been “steadily climbing” from the start of the year when it had the worst outbreak in the world. It says Ireland pulled off a “startling turnaround” noting that vaccination rates are among the highest in the world. Ireland took the top position from Norway which dominated for three months.“Even as the peak summer travel season unfolded alongside delta’s spread, Ireland and places like Spain, the Netherlands and Finland held down serious illness and deaths through pioneering moves to largely limit quarantine-free entry to immunised people,” Bloomberg says.“Bestowing more domestic freedoms on the inoculated helped boost vaccination levels to some of the highest in the world—over 90 per cent of Ireland’s adult population has received two shots—while allowing social activity to resume safely.”Bloomberg says its ranking is a “monthly snapshot of where the virus is being handled the most effectively with the least social and economic upheaval” . It compiles the rankings using 12 indicators from “ virus containment, the quality of healthcare, vaccination coverage, overall mortality and progress toward restarting travel and easing border curbs” in 53 economies.The top ranked countries are Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark.The news was welcomed by HSE chief executive Paul Reid who tweeted: “There have been really tough times for everyone.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government must be careful to avoid a “isive approach” to recognising the work done by frontline workers during the pandemic, Minister for Justice Heather Humphreys has said.With a debate underway over the cost and scope of any such move, the Government has been slow to outline precisely what its plans are for a “pandemic bonus”.“There are many frontline workers and we need to be careful not to adapt a isive approach on how to recognise the work of people during the pandemic,” Ms Humphreys said in Dublin Castle after a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday.She said that Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe were working on a proposal to be brought to cabinet.Asked about calls from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors for their members to be given a bonus, Ms Humphreys said that she “absolutely recongises” the work done by the Garda, as well as work done by her officials in the Department of Social Protection, where she is also Minister, in administering the pandemic unemployment payment to hundreds of thousands of people.“We want to make sure that we have something that recognises and is fair,” she said. “We have the nurses, the doctors, the guards, many many others. And that’s only to name a few. We want to recognise their contribution and the huge commitment and sacrifices indeed that they made during the pandemic and we will do that in a way that is appropriate”.Asked about the Green Party’s stance on the issue of 100 per cent redress for Mica-affected homeowners, Minister for Children and Green Party TD Roderic O’Gorman said the party recognised the original scheme needed to be broadened, but he did not commit to any one approach, saying he wanted to see the proposals being worked on by Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien.He did not comment on Mr O’Brien’s claim on Monday that the property market was not out of control, saying he believed the Government’s Housing for All plan was the way to solve the housing crisis.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"data centres could use 70 of ireland s electricity by 2030 committee to hear","story":"Data centres currently represent 11 per cent of the national grid capacity. Photograph: Alan BetsonIf all the proposed data centres for Ireland were to be connected they could use as much as 70 per cent of Ireland’s electricity grid capacity in 2030, according to a leading academic in this area. Dr Patrick Bresnihan of National University of Ireland, Maynooth, will tell the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Climate Change that while data centres currently represented 11 per cent of grid capacity, the energy used by those existing connections will rise to almost 30 per cent of overall capacity by the end of the decade. If all other data centres proposed for Ireland are allowed, their energy use would comprise 70 per cent of capacity on the national grid. This compares with the worldwide situation where only 2 per cent of electricity is consumed by data centres. In his opening statement to the committee , Dr Bresnihan raises concerns about the continued expansion of this sector on a number of grounds. “Data centres are currently responsible for 1.58 per cent of Ireland’s carbon emissions,” according to the opening statement. A lecturer in the university’s geography department, Dr Bresnihan also says that while Ireland has committed to having 70 per cent of its electricity sourced from renewables (mainly wind) by 2030, there will be a need, especially in the short term, for other sources of energy, which is likely to be natural gas. “Achieving ambitious emissions and renewable targets by 2030 will undoubtedly be far more difficult with the addition of more data centres to the grid,” he has stated. He said that an average data centre used as much electricity as a small city like Kilkenny. He also said that an average centre was also a large consumer of water, using an estimated 500,000 litres per day. Dr Bresnihan said that Singapore had become the first country in the world to introduce a moratorium on data centres. It has said it will only lift the moratorium when renewable energy capacity has been increased plus data storage technologies have been sufficiently developed to reduce the energy burden. “From these figures it is evident that Ireland shoulders more than a fair share of the energy and water burden of global digital activities… In a context where households are facing increased energy bills and carbon taxes, the continued granting of planning permission to energy-intensive data centres is already being perceived as unfair,” he has said. In a separate submission Professor James Carton of Dublin City University makes the case for a marked increase of the use of hydrogen as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. He says DCU has modelled for the storage needed for 100 per cent renewable energy and said it concluded it was beyond the capacity of batteries, but within that of hydrogen. “Many EU countries and countries worldwide are beginning to embrace hydrogen, rolling out heavy transport, co-firing gas turbines, decarbonising industries, developing ships to move it by sea, developing platforms to produce on offshore wind turbines while also preparing the groundwork for long-term energy storage. “Ireland must follow this lead produce green hydrogen at a useful scale to deploy it in suitable mature applications such as heavy transport, industry, and data centre power generation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lived winter discontent boris can avoid turning ted heath","story":"News last week about soaring fuel prices was the final part of the jigsaw. I did not need any more convincing: this really does feel like a weird return to Britain in the 1970s.For me, it is more than a vaguely remembered glimpse into the past. I became a BBC reporter in the summer of 1970 and, as with all formative experiences, it is a decade seared in my memory. The eerie old mood music is inescapable. I am not thinking of the songs, although it is uncanny that new Abba tunes are being released. The BBC isn’t helping by putting on repeats of Fawlty Towers and The Good Life.For those of us who lived through the 1970s, there is a clear sense that the bad times are back again. It is not a cheery trip down memory lane. It feels more like an awful warning.My first foreign assignment was to Vietnam, to cover the last stages of that “forever war”. In 1972, my bosses at Broadcasting House thought Saigon would fall they didn’t share their thoughts with me, they simply sent me to find out. In fact, it was three years later that South Vietnam was defeated, and then I was in the press room at the White House reporting for Radio 4’s Today programme on the last helicopter lifting off from the roof of the American Embassy.Gerald Ford was the interim president, and the man who took over was the peanut farmer, Democrat Jimmy Carter. He won because he was not the disgraced Republican president, Richard Nixon. The parallel is obvious: Joe Biden, who was not Donald Trump, brought us last month’s shambolic withdrawal from Kabul. For Vietnam, read Afghanistan. A bit spooky, don’t you think?The sharp rise in fuel prices and the ever-growing fear of inflation is the narrative arc which pulls the two decades together. The Bank of England has revealed that it now expects inflation, which saw a sharp increase last month to 3.2 per cent, to exceed 4 per cent before the year is out and remain there into the second quarter of next year. And it’s thanks to the energy price shock that last week queues formed outside petrol stations – once a familiar sight during the 1970s global oil crisis.Families are once again making an early start on their Christmas shopping, amid fears of a toy shortage caused by ongoing supply chain problems. In the 1970s, a shortage of plastic, sparked by the oil crisis, caused production problems for popular toys, from clacker balls and Space Hoppers to the Mastermind board game.That decade saw the first real signs that energy supplies could be crucial. For the influential pressure group, the Club of Rome, running out of fossil fuels was a serious threat.For today’s climate militants, abundant supplies of fossil fuels are the real cause for concern. The Club of Rome was keen on bringing economic development to a standstill with its zero-growth mantra. Present-day climate activists are inspired by the call for zero carbon. They too insist that not only governments but private citizens should take action. We should cut out red meat because it comes from cows emitting methane gas. Decades apart, they seem to share the same conclusion: hair shirts all round.In the early 1970s, I remember a prominent news presenter suggesting we should leave our comfortable lives to join her and others in forming a Somerset commune. To my embarrassment, she cheekily suggested I would be perfect commune material. Thankfully, I never got to pack my sandals.Allegra Stratton is the Government’s spokesperson on the COP26 climate change conference to be held next month in Glasgow. To much amusement, she suggested we could all do our bit by not rinsing our dishes before putting them into the dishwasher. It immediately brought to mind the advice given by one of Ted Heath’s cabinet ministers, Patrick Jenkin: his idea for saving power during the Three-Day Week – when, for three long months from midnight on New Year’s Day 1974, the Government imposed limits on electricity to reduce usage and help eke out coal reserves depleted by union strikes – was for all of us to brush our teeth in the dark.There was merriment partly because, in those days, there was much less talk about the need for the Government to send a message. Last week, when Boris Johnson took a train, and not the plane, from New York to Washington, no one laughed. On the eve of his climate speech at the UN, it was treated like routine PR.In the 1970s, union-backed strikes were frequent, and as I followed Heath around on his attempted re-election campaign in 1974, he routinely argued that the election would answer the simple question: “Who rules Britain?” At the ballot box, the response came swiftly: “Not you, mate.”It became clear in the months that followed that, increasingly, people were not expecting the answer to be found at Westminster. In February 1974, Labour’s Harold Wilson returned to power – but it wasn’t long before his replacement Jim Callaghan was at the helm, desperately trying to keep a lid on inflation with an official pay policy. BBC staff would buy steak in the subsidised canteen to take it home to their families.There was a common view throughout much of the 1970s that the country was, in effect, leaderless, best summed up in the famous winter of discontent headline attributed to Callaghan: “Crisis, what crisis?” I remember at a high-powered political reception a well-known industrialist came up to me and said, without any preamble: “Is Britain ungovernable?” As a BBC correspondent I could not, of course, openly agree, but the mood of pessimism was unavoidable.Britain’s image abroad suffered. On a Tube train from Heathrow airport with a group of newly-arrived Americans, I was startled when one of them shouted and pointed at some allotments by the side of the track. “Look,” he exclaimed to his friends, “subsistence farming.” To him, we were obviously down on our knees.In 1979, it all ended in public humiliation for the Labour government. When there is speculation now of a new winter of discontent, I feel a shudder remembering the rubbish that wasn’t cleared, the bodies that weren’t buried. It is not the same.This is where it is dangerous to make too close a connection with the past. Politics now does not depend on the hope of a Conservative revival. Labour is still unable to pose as a government-in-waiting, and Sir Keir Starmer is no Margaret Thatcher. The unions have nothing like the power they used to wield. Disputes over ideology have lost their bite. The pandemic has forced the Conservatives to become unlikely advocates of the Big State.But Covid has thrown up a raft of problems, too, which has left many voters feeling let down and marginalised. That is why I am thankful the true spirit of the 1970s is firmly in the past. I spent a good deal of that decade covering the conflict in Northern Ireland, and reporting on wars abroad, often at the end of a crackly telephone line. Computer wizardry was in its infancy. Colour television had only just arrived. The human genome had not been charted, and we would not have been able to mount in less than a year a successful vaccination campaign against a deadly virus.It is fun to play with history but, like children, we should be careful about playing with fire. One of the key lessons from the 1970s is that, in a relatively short period of time, how easy it is for an administration to lose control. Now, the country is emerging from its toughest civil emergency since the war. A sense of proportion is what is needed.John Sergeant is former chief political correspondent of the BBC and former political editor of ITN.

Negative coronavirus tests and proof of natural immunity after recently recovering from the virus would no longer be permitted.The venues include all nightclubs, and other venues open after 1am offering alcohol, music, and dancing, as well as indoor events such as live music venues or large receptions with 500 or more people where they are likely to mix or move around during the event.Vaccine passports will also be required at outdoor, crowded events such as festivals with 4,000 or more people and large sports and music stadia where there are 10,000 or more fans.Communal worship, wedding ceremonies, funerals, other commemorative events and protests will be exempt as will workplaces, where it is being left to employers to decide on their best practice measures.Under 18s will be excluded as will police officers, council officials and emergency services acting in their official duties, diplomats or anyone working for an international organisation.More from NewsTime Team television show revived by fans with new hostAngela Merkel never rode to Britain\u0026#39s rescue over Brexit - and neither will Olaf ScholzThe student loans scheme deserves to be saved - lowering the repayment threshold would help do thatPolice fear they may have to guard petrol pumps if fuel crisis does not easeEmergency workers prioritised for fuel at supermarkets as panic-buying sweeps the countryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"always alternative panic stations","story":"In modern parlance, the phrase “Don’t panic” means, in effect, “Panic”. Last year, at the beginning of Covid, it was loo paper and pasta. Last week, no sooner did the authorities use those words about petrol supplies than queues formed at the filling stations.Is there anything to be done about this? It is hard to see what other words the Government could employ. We in the media would soon detect ministers if they pretended there was no shortage. Yet as soon as they admit there is one, we ask them how the public should react. They have to say “Don’t panic”, because that is the right advice. Unfortunately, it is also the trigger.I suppose ministers could lecture people for being so silly, but that is rarely a productive tactic. Perhaps there is nothing that can usefully be said: it is just a matter of the public calming down and getting the measure of the situation. This weekend, I found most country neighbours simply making fewer car journeys and trying to sit the mini-crisis out.It would help, though, if the authorities had some temporary remedies up their sleeves. In rural areas particularly, there is a lot of “red diesel” about, reserved for tractors and other vehicles that do not use public roads, and stored on farms. It is red because it is so dyed for identification: it needs identifying because it is untaxed. It works fine in normal diesel cars, so the red is supposed to detect tax evasion in the engine.How about emergency measures in times of shortage which removed the fines for using red diesel on roads and allowed its owners to sell it to customers running out of the normal stuff? It would be an additional attraction in farm shops.No doubt safety experts would protest noisily, but I say, “Don’t panic”.It is now the party conference season but, like “The Season” in high society (Henley, the EtonHarrow match, the Derby, debutantes etc), it is shadow of its former self. Commerce – in the form of lobbyists and PR – has taken over. The conferences of the main political parties are no longer the gatherings of great tribes. Instead they are media opportunities for the Westminster people who are already in charge anyway.Does this matter? It is not, after all, as if Tory or Labour conferences in the old days were hotbeds of intellectual vitality. It was not always fun to sit for a week (they were much longer drawn-out occasions 40 years ago) in Blackpool. But I think it does matter a bit, for the same reason that talk of the Red Wall, “levelling up” and “people from Somewhere” mean something.As a journalist in the 1980s, I attended both main party conferences every year. I did not exactly like either. Labour, threatened by the BenniteArthur Scargill Left, was extremely rancorous. The Tories, usually riding high, were smug. But one did feel that both, in their very different ways, were occasions in which metropolitan preoccupations did not dominate. You could see the workings of each party’s grass roots, discussing the things they cared about. You could witness one of the most important features of the first century of democracy – the power of a mass movement.In the 21st century, the masses hold enormous power, as interpreted by focus groups, but extremely little by means of direct political engagement. The unhappy paradox is that our age, though obsessed with equality, is run by elites much more cut off than in the past.Rewilding is all the rage. It contains many interesting ideas and possibilities. But the name can be misleading. In a small, long-settled, quite heavily populated country like Britain, nothing can be truly wild. Almost all ecology needs to be stewarded by the human race.At present, most of the inhabitants of the areas targeted for rewilding feel uneasy. If they make a living by farming, shooting, fisheries or forestry, they tend to be disapproved of by rewilders. The two sets of people most keen on rewilding usually come from outside the districts they wish to change. Either they are committed ideologues or they are extremely rich people who, having made lots of money through modern industrial and commercial economies, have turned romantic.The recently announced Affric Highlands project (“Scotland’s wild east-west corridor”) is accompanied by an improbable painting of how the future rewilded scenery might look. It resembles an illustration in one of those children’s books that cram as many species as possible into one spot in order to identify them. Deer, otter, birds of prey, wild boar, wildcat, pine marten, red squirrels and lynx seem to flourish within a few feet of each other.In a rather obscure part of the picture, a stalker with a deer’s carcass slung over the back of a pony can be discerned. This last is a pleasing concession to reality: the culling of animals, by people, is essential to the balance of species.I hope a way forward can be found which links human prosperity to the flourishing of nature. If not, much of Scotland will be subjected to a re-run of the notorious Highland clearances in the early 19th century, with eco-lairds as the villains.Parallel with rewilding, there should be re-peopling. Human beings too have natural habitats, and these should be respected.More from NewsTime Team television show revived by fans with new hostAngela Merkel never rode to Britain\u0026#39s rescue over Brexit - and neither will Olaf ScholzThe student loans scheme deserves to be saved - lowering the repayment threshold would help do thatPolice fear they may have to guard petrol pumps if fuel crisis does not easeEmergency workers prioritised for fuel at supermarkets as panic-buying sweeps the countryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency workers prioritised fuel supermarkets panic buying","story":"Supermarkets have begun prioritising emergency workers for fuel and turning away members of the public amid continued panic-buying across the country.Staff at the Tesco station in Clevedon, north Somerset, only allowed police, fire, NHS and other emergency service workers to fill up their vehicles this morning as fuel stocks ran low. It came as the Government faced calls to give priority access to fuel supplies to healthcare staff and other critical workers.Motorists arriving at the station forecourt next to the Tesco superstore in Kenn Road, Clevedon, were told they could not fill up until a new delivery of diesel and petrol arrived, and were asked to wait in the superstore car park next door.However, emergency service staff were allowed onto the forecourt where three aisles of petrol and diesel pumps had been coned off to the public. Just before 11am this morning, a solitary Highways Agency vehicle was filling up with fuel as other motorists waited patiently nearby in the drizzling rain. A female worker at the station told The : “We’ve only been allowing police, fire and NHS workers to fill up this morning. “We were running low on supplies but held some back especially for emergency workers. “A tanker has just arrived with some more fuel so we will soon be able to help everyone. It’s a pain, but most people have been pretty understanding.” One of those waiting to fill up was Chris Parsons, a 34-year-old carpenter from Bristol. He said: “It’s very frustrating because I have been here for an hour and I’ve got a job to go to. “But I think it is only fair that they are prioritising the police and NHS when supplies are low.” Later the cones were removed from the forecourt and a large queue of vehicles formed around the station as motorists were allowed to the pumps once again. A source at Tesco said the supermarket giant had no “general policy” to prioritise key workers but added that store managers were free to use their inidual “judgement”.Morrisons petrol station in Newquay, Cornwall, has also begun prioritising fuel for ambulance workers and police, according to reports.It came as ministers consider an emergency plan to give critical workers exclusive access to certain petrol stations to ease the fuel crisis.In Scarborough, North Yorkshire, police officers were forced to patrol on their bicycles after they were unable to refuel their car.“So couldn’t refuel the police vehicle tonight! Couldn’t therefore conduct rural patrols,” North Yorkshire Police wrote on Twitter, alongside a picture of a police bicycle.“Are you a responsible motorist? Did you really need to brim your tank?” the force added.One ambulance driver in north London has told the BBC he visited several filling stations in his search for fuel.“I had zero tank, I was on my reserve, the light was on, it was getting chaotic, my heart rate was going through the sky,” he says, after finally buying fuel in Brent Cross.Dr David Wrigley, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, warned essential services could be hit if staff were unable to get to work because they could not fill up.“I know many of my health and social care colleagues will be getting into the car this morning, nervously looking at the fuel dial and wondering if they’ve got enough fuel to do their day-to-day work,” he told Times Radio.“We can’t be waiting two or three hours in a queue for fuel when we have patients to see.“It’s a critical situation where we’re unsure we’ll have the fuel to do NHS and social care work, so a plan does need to be in place.”However, a headteachers’ union said prioritising key workers for fuel was not a sensible solution as it could cause “more chaos” on the forecourts.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “The last thing children need is further disruption to education given the experience of the last 18 months.“Prioritising key workers is not a sensible solution as it would be impossible to enforce and could cause more chaos on the forecourts.“The only real answer is for the Government to do everything in its power to get fuel to pumps and bring this situation to an end.”He added that, so far, the school leaders’ union is not hearing that fuel supply issues are causing major problems for schools.“But if shortages go on much longer it is possible that children and teachers could find themselves unable to get to school - there could be problems with transport for special schools in particular,” Mr Whiteman said.A Tesco spokesperson said: “We have good availability of fuel, and we’re working really hard to ensure regular deliveries to our petrol filling stations across the UK every day. The petrol station at our Clevedon Superstore in Somerset is currently open for all customers and trading as normal.”A Morrisons spokesperson apologised “for any inconvenience caused during this time”, adding: “It is a rapidly moving situation and we are working hard with our suppliers to ensure we can continue to keep our pumps open and serve our customers.”More from NewsTime Team television show revived by fans with new hostAngela Merkel never rode to Britain\u0026#39s rescue over Brexit - and neither will Olaf ScholzThe student loans scheme deserves to be saved - lowering the repayment threshold would help do thatPolice fear they may have to guard petrol pumps if fuel crisis does not easeSabina Nessa: Man denies murder of teacherMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roger hunt liverpools record league goalscorer won world cup","story":"Roger Hunt, who has died aged 83, was Liverpool’s record league goalscorer, and centre-forward in the England team that won the World Cup in 1966.Hunt made his debut for England in 1962, and went to the World Cup in Chile that year as a promising young member of the squad. Thereafter, however, he seemed to be in and out of Alf Ramsey’s plans, and although he had a healthy scoring record at international level, in the immediate run-up to the 1966 tournament it was Geoff Hurst whom the England manager seemed to be favouring as a striking partner for Jimmy Greaves.Then, in July, Hurst had a shocking game in a friendly against Denmark, and when Hunt was summoned for the next match, against Poland in Katowice, he seized his chance by scoring with a fulminating half-volley from 25 yards. When England’s World Cup began six days later, against Uruguay at Wembley, it was Hunt and Greaves who were paired together up front, with John Connelly as the wide man in what was still an orthodox 4-3-3 formation.It is usually forgotten that England’s victory in the competition was not the result of a string of majestic displays that ensured an orderly procession to the final. In fact England played very moderately in their opening round of matches, and only progressed thanks to a goal by Hunt against Mexico – the Liverpool player tucking in a rebound from a Greaves effort – and a further brace of his against France.At that stage, of the attacking players he seemed to be the only one in form, his three goals lengthening his streak to 15 in 16 international games.It was Greaves – England’s classiest player and the crowd’s favourite – who was most out of sorts, and the gashed shin he received against France provided Ramsey with the excuse to drop him. In came Hurst, who in turn took his opportunity against Portugal and Argentina. Come the final, he was playing too well to be left out and with Greaves ready to return, it was for Ramsey (now settled on just two men up front) to decide whether the mercurial Tottenham striker should displace the more workmanlike Hunt.The manager decided to stick with a winning side, much to Greaves’s – and the fans’ – disappointment. Although in effect it was Hurst who had replaced Greaves, for some years it was Hunt who was the target of abuse from supporters convinced that he had prevented their idol from enjoying the greatest moment of his career.Despite Ramsey keeping faith with him, the fair-haired Hunt actually had his poorest match of the tournament in the final. He missed a clear chance at the end of the first half, hitting his shot straight at the West German goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski, and four minutes from time, with England leading 2-1, wasted a three-on-one opportunity by passing much too early to Bobby Charlton. Three minutes later, West Germany equalised.Hunt did, however, prove to be a key figure in what was probably the game’s decisive moment, Hurst’s shot in extra time that cannoned down from the underside of the German crossbar. As the ball came back down, Hunt was the nearest player to it assuming that it was going to cross the line, he turned away from it instead of completing the goal, arms aloft in celebration.In fact, it has since been shown that not all of the ball crossed the goal line when it touched the ground, but Hunt’s assumption that it would was enough to persuade the Soviet linesman, Tofik Bahramov, to signal a goal. England led 3-2, and never looked like anything but victors thereafter.Roger Hunt was born at Golborne, near Manchester, on July 20 1938. His family ran a transport business, and as a young man he worked as a lorry driver. He got his break as footballer player in 1959, when he was turning out for the amateur side Stockton Heath in the Mid-Cheshire league. A Liverpool scout came to watch a player from another team, but instead noticed Hunt’s talents.He was quickly signed by Liverpool, then languishing in the Second Division, and after only five outings in the reserves was promoted to the first team. He scored on his league debut, against Scunthorpe, and for the next 10 years was the club’s first-choice striker.Bill Shankly had been appointed Liverpool’s manager shortly before Hunt arrived at Anfield, and together the pair began to bring the team greater success than any it had yet known. In 1962 the side won the Second Division title, with Hunt scoring 41 goals, still a club record. Two years later they won the First Division championship, and the year after that the FA Cup for the first time in their history, Hunt claiming the first of the team’s goals in their 2-1 victory over Leeds.The next season, 1965-66, the club again won the League title, but despite a goal from Hunt lost to Borussia Dortmund in the final of the European Cup-Winners’ Cup.Much of Hunt’s success at club level was due to his striking partnership with Ian St John, but he was a more skilful player than he was often given credit for. Certainly, his principal assets were his stamina and his sturdy frame, but at 5ft 9in he was no burly giant in the John Charles mould, and many of his goals were the result of his anticipation and good touch.Admittedly he was not in the same class as Greaves as a taker of half-chances, but he was a better team player – indeed a quieter inidual altogether – and not incapable of scoring memorable goals, notably at Anfield against Inter Milan in the semi-final of the 1965 European Cup. In 492 games for the team he scored 286 goals, a tally only surpassed among Liverpool players by Ian Rush his total of 244 league goals remains the club record. For his goalscoring feats, and his gentlemanly conduct on the pitch, he was dubbed “Sir Roger” in the chants of the fans on the Kop.In 1969 Hunt, then 31, moved from Liverpool to Bolton Wanderers – the team he had supported as a boy – as Shankly began to rebuild his side. In 76 league appearances for the Trotters Hunt scored 24 times, before retiring in 1972. He had scored, on average, 5.8 goals for every 10 games that he had played in his career.Hunt was capped 34 times by England, scoring 18 times. He made his last appearance for the national side against Sweden in 1968, thereafter declaring himself unavailable for selection, a decision some attributed to his feeling that many fans still resented him for having kept Greaves out of the side in 1966.At the age of 34, Hunt took over the management of his family’s haulage business near Manchester, retiring from that in 1995. He was also a long-serving member of the Pools Panel, which adjudicates on the results of matches for the benefit of pools coupons when league fixtures are postponed because of bad weather.In common with four other members of the 1966 side who had not previously been honoured, Hunt was – belatedly – appointed MBE in 2000.Roger Hunt married, first, in 1959, Patricia O’Brien they had a daughter and a son.

Ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Mr Starmer of wanting to prop up wealth and power while ex-Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded the conference a s***show.But Shadow Scotland Secretary Ian Murray branded the move deliberate sabotage, saying Mr McDonald had signed off Labouraposs policy of at least a £ minimum himself. As Starmer allies pointed the finger at John McDonnell for helping arrange the resignation, Mr Murray told LBC: Does it seem orchestrated  Youaposll have to ask Andy McDonald.  And sources branded Mr McDonaldaposs resignation amateurish, as he did not tell key shadow ministers before sending his letter.The row will come to a head tonight when delegates vote on a grassroots motion calling on Labour to back a £ per hour statutory minimum wage.Shadow Cabinet member Nick Thomas-Symonds today said Labour can assess a £ minimum but only before an election. Cheers of come on Andy greeted Mr McDonald last night as he took to the stage at a rally organised by Tribune magazine. Mr McDonald told the crowd it had been a torrid day, and added: Itaposs been a really dficult thing for me to do. He argued a £ minimum wage at least was first proposed in  and was not enough to honour the work of key workers during Covid. The left-winger is scheduled to appear at a discussion at the fringes of the conference in Brighton on Tuesday with former leader, and ally, Jeremy Corbyn. The row threatens to overshadow the message the wider shadow cabinet wishes to present, with shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth announcing that a Labour government would double dementia spending. He will also accuse the Government under the Tories of creating a two-tier health system that is threatening a universal NHS.

In his resignation letter, Mr McDonald wrote: I joined your frontbench team on the basis of the pledges that you made in the leadership campaign to bring about unity within the party and maintain our commitment to socialist policies. After  months of your leadership, our movement is more ided than ever and the pledges that you made to the membership are not being honoured. This is just the latest of many.

But Health Secretary Sajid Javid made a dramatic U-turn after a Tory revolt, and relegated them to Plan B.Now officials have formally rolled out their proposals for this contingency measure to be made mandatorythe NHS comes under unsustainable pressure. Here are the full details. All the venues included The events that may be required to roll out the scheme include all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing.

WhatI donapost have a vaccine  Under the proposals, all adults will need to have been double-jabbed - in other words, had their second dose at least  days ago - to visit affected venues. There would not be an option to take a test insteadyouaposve not had the vaccine. However, the rules could be dferent for staff.

This is to avoid them losing their jobtheyaposve not had the vaccine, which is a whole dferent can of worms for the government. What happens next  The Government is asking for views from businesses, event organisers, and venue operators on its proposals by October . Labour has slammed Health Secretary Sajid Javidaposs mixed messages on Covid passports.Deputy leader Angela Rayner said: The government’s approach to Covid passports has been shambolic from the start. There has never been any clarity from ministers about what vaccine passports were supposed to achieve, how they would work and what was expected from businesses and workers. Health Minister Maggie Throup said: “Our Autumn and Winter plan puts us on a sure footing and gives the whole country the best possible chance of living with COVID- in the months ahead, without the need for unwanted social and economic restrictions. “The vaccine programme has tilted the odds in our favour in our shared fight against this virus and while we are totally confident the careful steps we are taking will help rule out the need for mandatory vaccine certicates, we need to be prepared for all scenarios.  Brits have already been braced for a dficult winter as respiratory viruses including Covid and the flu thrive in the cold seasons. Even though more than  million adults have had both of their Covid jabs, which counts for % of over-s, people are still at risk of catching the virus and transmitting it.

John McDonnell accused the Labour leader of breaking his promises to the members as the partyaposs annual conference descended into infighting.Former leader Jeremy Corbyn also lashed out at his successor who he accused of seeking to prop up those with wealth and power.Labouraposs civil war was reignited on Monday when Mr McDonald dramatically quit as Shadow Employment Rights Secretary in a row over the minimum wage. He claimed Mr Starmer had told him to block a £ minimum wage and said the leader had not honoured “our commitment to socialist policies” One of the last survivors of the Corbyn era in the shadow cabinet, Mr McDonaldaposs departure stoked acrimony and caused tensions to spill into the open. On Tuesday, Mr McDonnell lashed out at Mr Starmer for going back on pledges during his Labour leadership campaign.AskedMr Starmer was trying to move in a completely dferent direction without him, Mr McDonnell told Sky News: “If he does, I wish he’d told us that when he stood for leader” “When he stood for leader there were two basic promises - one, ‘I will unite the party’. “When he was talking about uniting the party he talked about more member engagement, not less. “The second, he put out a -point policy plan which was largely based upon the last two manestos, and that’s how he got elected leader.” He said he had “tried to” support Mr Starmer but “some of us had to speak out” over factional changes at conference. Mr Corbyn told the Mirror that Mr Starmer should stick to his commitments during a fringe event. He said: I read the  points that he put forward for the leadership and I think when you put forward something you should try and stick to it as a policy thing. But I donapost want to get involved in some personal spat with people. I want to see a dferent society, a better world and a Labour movement that can deliver that by inspiring people. The former leader insisted that Mr McDonaldaposs departure was not a plot - after some critics accused him of trying to derail the conference. Shadow Scotland Secretary Ian Murray had branded the move deliberate sabotage, saying Mr McDonald had signed off Labouraposs policy of at least a £ minimum himself. Mr Corbyn said he had series of private conversations with Mr McDonald, who is a close friend. Andy worked very closely with us in the shadow cabinet and he took what was for him a personal and very dficult and very principled decision, he said. If it had been a deep-laid Machiavellian plot to announce a resignation on a particular afternoon in Brighton, it wouldaposve leaked out weeks ago. Mr Corbyn, who lost the Labour whip in a row over anti-Semitism last year, said he believed he should be admitted back into the parliamentary party after having his membership restored. He said: I don’t think the Parliamentary Labour Party should try to gainsay what the National Executive has decided so as far as I am concerned there is no case other than I should be reinstated on the Labour whip. It comes as Mr Corbyn called on the Labour party to have a sense of humanity and self-criticism on the part they played in wars in the past. Speaking at a Labour Conference fringe event on aposHow can we end  years of the war on terror , he said:We need to look to the future where we have a foreign policy and international justice strategy based on peace or justice, on human rights and respect for people and deal with the real issues of this planet. Which are global poverty inequality, as COVID is showing us and of course, the threats of environmental destruction and climate change, that has to be the right way forward. Yesterday Mr Corbyn accused Mr Starmer of failing to challenge the wealthy and the powerful. Writing in the i newspaper, he said: So far this week, Labour’s leaders have shown they want to prop up, not challenge that wealth and power. There is another way forward, that is based on social justice, and in the policies the majority of people actually want, not what the establishment and its media mouthpieces insist they should want.

Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth revealed the crackdown as he outlined the party’s proposals for boosting public health. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror at the party’s conference in Brighton, he told how his young daughters Gracie, , and Annie, seven, put him under “horrendous” pressure to buy unhealthy food after being seduced by ads. “I see it as a parent myself,” he said. “It’s horrendous. I wish it was just crisps and chocolate - all these sweets which are disgusting! Why on earth would anyone want to eat these pure sugary sweets ”  He admitted: “Of course at times I give in because I know what it’s like - I’m human like everyone . “I don’t want to give in and I beat myself up and feel incredibly guilty - hugely guilty because I know it’s unhealthy. “I’m not blaming parents because people are under stress, under pressure - people are working hard, le these days is very exhausting for a lot of people, so I don’t blame anyone.” Britain has one of the worst child obesity rates in western Europe. A fth of  to -year-olds are obese, according to latest figures for England.  Last July, the Government unveiled plans to ban unhealthy buy one, get one free deals, bolster calorie labelling on restaurant menus and ban junk food adverts before the pm watershed. Mr Ashworth said another measure to tackle rising childhood obesity is outlawing the placing of junk food billboards on kids’ routes to schools. “We need to block advertising of junk food near schools,” said Mr Ashworth. “We live in an environment which is encouraging unhealthy eating all the time and we need to tackle that.” In July , Paulette Hamilton, vice chairwoman of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, said councils needed “tougher planning powers to tackle any clustering of takeaway outlets or junk food advertising, for example near schools”. Read more While details about how far the exclusion zone should extend are still being thrashed out, Mr Ashworth said seeing ads on the way to lessons was a key driver of youngsters’ craving for unhealthy snacks. “The pressures it puts on exhausted parents who probably just give in… also, it’s cheaper to just buy processed food, which is high in sugar and salt,” he said. “Children have to be at the heart of everything we do. There can be no keener judgement of how you judge a society than how you treat your children - that’s what Nelson Mandela said.” The Shadow Health Secretary revealed an analysis by the House of Commons Library which showed that from   to  , local authorities’ children’s public health services faced real-terms budget cuts of more than % - slashed by almost £million.According to Labour, money for obesity services for kids was cut by .% in real-terms and the public health services fund for children aged five to  was reduced by .%.“Prescribed public health services” for children aged up to five suffered a .% hit. “Children’s health and wellbeing has been neglected for too long,” said Mr Ashworth. “It’s time now for us to have the biggest children’s health and wellbeing programme we have ever seen.” He believed money should be pumped into protecting public health - branding it a “ economy” to slash cash on prevention only to fork out later for curing ailments. “There’s an old African saying - ‘Health is created at home, hospitals are for repair’,” he said. “To keep people healthy, you’ve got to create a community in which people stay healthy, you’ve got to give them opportunities, you’ve got to invest in early years.” Salford-born Mr Ashworth, who delivers his main conference speech on Tuesday, also feared for tots who are usually monitored by health visitors after visits were delayed during the pandemic. “Health visitors, who are absolutely vital for ensuring that the very smallest of children are getting the check-ups and support they need - we haven’t been able to do as many visits because of the pandemic,” said the Leicester South MP. “But even before the pandemic, children’s health and wellbeing was, I believe, seriously neglected in this country.” He pointed to the rising number of children relying on foodbanks as “one of the most shameful things that scars our society”. The Mirror told in May how the Trussell Trust gave away ,, emergency parcels in the year to April. Nearly a million packages went to children - and with each parcel containing enough food for three meals a day for three days, it means the Trust provided ,, kidsapos meals. Mr Ashworth, who has previously spoken about his dad’s battle with drink, also pledged to boost alcohol labelling so calories are displayed on cans and bottles to curb boozing. He also pushed for a greater role for the healthy living index - a measure of wellbeing - to be used alongside regular reporting of economic growth figures. “It should be as central to our debate and public policy as GDP ,” said Mr Ashworth.

Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester Mayor The King of the North swaggered into town making no secret of his hope to also rule Englandaposs South, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland too. He has the aura of a man with a little power whoaposd like more and as popular on the fringe as well as dominating a four-way conversation on the main stage after complaining that denying him a prime time solo slot was Labour cancel culture. Needs to be an MP to run. Rochdale  Marked down half a point for failing to mask naked ambition. Score:   Sadiq Khan, London Mayor Khanaposs position as face of the countryaposs capital and one of the worldaposs greatest cities earned him a prized speaking spot and jogging along the Brighton seafront symbolised the gas in his tank as he called on the Tory Government to mobilise the Army to fight petrol shortages. Urging Labour to cut the “London bashing” to win votes in the North smacked of a dig at rival Andy “Madchester” Burnham. Like Burnham, heaposd also need to be re-elected an MP to run. Must pick up speed to be a serious contender. Score:   Lisa Nandy, Shadow Foreign Secretary The Wigan warrior didnapost sparkle as brightly as previous conferences and her call for Britain to build bridges with nations in Europe and the rest of the world could also apply to her and the party when she finished a disappointing third behind Starmer and Rebecca Long Bailey in last yearaposs Labour bun fight. Disapproved of Rayneraposs late night scumgate slip. Handy Nandy needs to find her authentic voice again.  Score:   Angela Rayner, Deputy Leader Spending most of your week justying a wine oaposclock outburst against “Tory scum” at a post-watershed reception wasnapost in the script after starting the conference with a couple of much-talked about interviews in the Daily Mirror and Times. Rayneraposs inspiring backstory of escaping a concrete booted start to le explains her anger at a Conservative Government plunging people like the young her deeper into poverty and despair but the street language prompted loud whispering about her suitability for the top job Score: .  Richard Burgon, Socialist Campaign Group secretary Starmer changing Labour leadership rules was specically intended to block Corbynite mini-mes like the Leeds East MP from standing never mind winning. So the current leaderaposs partial success, doubling the parliamentary qualication from % to % of MPs but dropping the abandonment of OMOV andto an electoral college, was a blow to Burgon and his comrades. He and his wing on the Left were also banished to the fringe. Downnot out. Score:   Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Seized her moment in the spotlight as chief bean counter with an animated speech hailed bysketch writer John Crace as less wooden than past performances, an assessment that is glowing praise indeed from the chief grump. Reeves is backtracking to the fiscal prudence of Gordon Brown after the radicalism of John McDonnell and looks and sounds confident in her brief. How she does against Rishi Sunak will determine her fate. Score: .  Wes Streeting, Shadow Secretary for Child Poverty The free school meals kids from a council flat in Londonaposs Stepney earned rave reviews on the Brighton fringe with a string of electrying appearances. Expressing radical policies reasonably with moral authority earned thunderous applause and,this isnapost in bad taste to observe, has a new lease of le now heaposs mercully cancer-free after a nasty health scare. Opened a lot of eyes and did himself a lot of good. Score: .  Read more Dark Horse Pride comes before a fall so all the riders openly jockeying for position could be unseated and a dark horse thunder through to pip them at the post. Boris Johnson calls a General Election next year or  and Keir Starmer finishes as Prime Minister, age and circumstances would unsaddle the leadership ambitions of most already galloping down the course. Starmer loses and a long-odds outsider could appear from nowhere to take the crown. Funny old game, politics.

Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Sep | commentsSadiq Khan has spoken movingly about needing round the clock police protection because of “the colour of his skin and the god he worships.” The London Mayor said he was given the confidence to talk about the threats and vitriol he receives for the first time after seeing the response to Marcus Rashford and the England team speaking out about racism.Speaking at Labour Party Conference, he revealed he rejected a police protection detail when he was first elected Mayor of London, because he likes using the tube and walking around in the capital.But the “game changer”, he said, was when officers told his we and chief of staff that his family and members of staff would be at riskhe didn’t accept the -strong politan Police detail who protects him day or night. “You can’t do anything spontaneously, for obvious reasons.” he told a fringe event hosted by the New Statesman magazine. “Riding a bike to work, which is something I do often, is dferent for me than it would be for you. Using the tube, which I do is dferent for me than it is for you. “Walking my dog in the park is dferent for me than it is for you. “ He said going for a jog was also dficult, but that he always beats his security detail when he goes running.  He added: ”Itaposs hard. Itaposs really hard. Itaposs hard for my family. Having snfer dogs in your house is not fun. Not being able to answer the door is not great. Itaposs not fun. Itaposs hard. “And my staff - I have the best staff in the world - but to have to give your staff counselling because of the vitriol directed at me that theyaposve got to read from letters, emails, itaposs horrible. Itaposs tough.” He went on: The game changer for me was when the police spoke to my chief of staff and my we to try and persuade me to accept. And the point they made was I may reject it, but do I realise that because of me, those who are with me may be at risk - whether itaposs my we and kids, or whether itaposs my staff who I work with. And that was the reason why I said yes in the end, because Iaposve got a duty of care to my staff. I love my family, I love my staff too by the way.  He said it was “upsetting” to be criticised in the media for driving to a park, on police advice, to walk his dog. But he has hesitated to speak out about the abuse and threats he and his team receive, because he fears it might prevent other people of colour standing for office. “Imagine being my we or my daughters or my mum. Itaposs not nice,” he said. “And me saying it comes with the package is discouraging someone running to be the mayor. So I donapost talk about it....itaposs probably the first time Iaposve talked about it. I might get emotional.” The London Mayor said he had been given the confidence to speak out. by England’s football team speaking out against racism in the Euro  tournament. “The way Marcus Rashford, Sancho, Saka, have talked about it, and the response theyaposve received has given me so much hope. “And itaposs given me confidence to talk about it myself, not because Iaposm playing the victim card or the race card or the muslim card, but because people need to know.” He added: “Iaposm not going to allow these racists and these Islamophobes to intimidate me, and Iaposll never bow to them. “The mayor of the greatest city in the world needs protection  hours a day seven days a week because of the colour of his skin and the god he worships.

I would [FILL THIS BIT IN LATER]. Thataposs the speech Keir Starmer is probably going to make. It will be written by a committee, it will have taken them months, and whole chunks will have been negotiated with dferent bits of the Labour machine. Which is why it will be as inspiring as a cup of cold sick on a drizzly day in Newport Pagnell.  Trans rights are human rights. We must build back better than the Tories destroyed. And all the ways I am not Boris Johnson, the principle one of which is that I am incapable of projecting my personality more than about six centimetres. Johnson has projected his personality across the globe. Itaposs vile, self-serving, childish, and slapdash, but basic herd behaviour makes it more interesting than someone who is thoughtful, clever, principled and careful. We all know the latter makes a better person. But we also know that leaders first have to get your attention, then keep it. Gaining your respect is a bonus, and few manage that. Labour was a party founded from movements against what was wrong. It is good at realising what is wrong, and coming up with some pretty innovative solutions. It listens, and dreams of what could be. The Conservatives, by comparison, were founded on a wish to maintain what is. It is bred in the bone to say this is working great for us, letaposs not change. Labour picks at scabs the Tories plaster over them. Labour criticises its own victories, its greatest leader, its factions multiply like mould on sweaty cheese. The Tories spend zero time on the leaders of its past. They do not wonder about Mrs Thatcher, or argue about whether Iain Duncan Smith is a human being or an angry squirrel.  They just say: We were in power, great! They ignore the times and reasons they werenapost. Labour picks the fluff from its navel, gives it a good snf, rolls it between its fingers, wonders what it is, considers showing it to other people and asking them what they think. Itaposs more likely to get sectioned than elected. Starmer should sit down with a pen and notepad and write his own speech. He has a good character and a personality that is informed, principled, and charismatic, but he has not been able to project it in a pandemic where all human interaction has boiled down to a two-dimensional computer screen. Sit with him at a table and youaposd be impressed but he has to relax more in interviews so that he can do the same when heaposs projected into millions of living rooms and car shares. Read more Whereas two dimensions rather suit Johnson, whose personality is galactic in its ambitions and whose character has not altered since he was a bawling infant demanding bitty. While he dodges his fuel crisis, the North and his own ethics commissioner, Keir has to capitalise on a cautiously reopening Britain, talk to those queuing for hours to get to the forecourts so they can work, show how he can make our lives and work valued and valuable, and do it without sleaze or scandal. He could promise to redecorate the Downing Street flat with help from Wilko, like the rest of us. So the speech has to say: I am Keir Starmer. This is me. I know you, and what you want, and hereaposs how Iaposll do it. It should not mention Johnson, who is an attention black hole, gobbling up bandwidth. It should not mention Blair, Corbyn, or anything from the past. And for the love of Pete, stay away from cervixes. Starmer is benighted by a party that canapost agree, and a machinery that grinds up true leadership and spits out a grudge-filled coalition. Heaposs tinkered with the rules, but also needs to strip out every unnecessary cog and spanner from the works. A leader has to be an autocrat. And he has to emote, project, use facial expressions. The camera loves it, because people connect with it. Until he shows us his loves and hates, his dream to replace Johnsonaposs lumbering, never-ending nightmare, heaposll only ever be a caretaker, the man keeping it ticking over until a new boss comes along. Heaposs been working on fighting an election in two years time. It could be called within months, by a maverick with a taste for risk and unerring knack for self-preservation. Starmeraposs speech has to say he knows what heaposs up against, heaposs ready now, and not only tell them itaposs time to fall in line - but to give them a faith in his abilities that means they want to march with him.

It is said that the traffic was caused after the petrol station received a delivery, causing delays that resulted in a mass standstill. Millions of motorists have been affected by the desperate fuel crisis, making scenes like this common across Britain over the weekend. Images show a Texaco petrol station with traffic queues forming around the corner and down a long road.  This caused traffic jams for those who were not even needing to queue for petrol, including a bus that was forced to let the passengers off as they were stuck in standstill. A still from the footage shows the extent of the traffic jam, which caused disruption to a number of drivers and local residents. Colin Oladimeji, the drone cameraman from Skyview London, captured the footage on Sunday and expressed his shock at the situation. A local resident, Sylvia Loach said: And itaposs bloody noisy too. Horns blaring most of the night and day as people force themselves into the queue and hold up all the main traffic. Hoping they run out by the time I get home and itaposs quieter tonight.  And Jane James added: I just walked past there. Absolute madness. The queues come after a shortage of HGV drivers combined with motorists stockpiling on fuel have left Britain in a fuel crisis. More than half of petrol stations have run out of fuel following a weekend of panic-buying, despite government warnings that drivers should not haul fuel. This has left some petrol stations forced to impose a £ ration limit to avoid running out of fuel, with Tesco, BP and Esso forced to close some of their branches.Comment MORE ON Petrol pricesPanic-buying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They checked in at the easyJet desk at Bristol Airport on Friday and handed over their baggage and car seat at the check-in desk. The family were planning to drive from Lisbon across the border to western Spain to stay with Ireneaposs family for the ceremony on Saturday. Leigh and Irene had filled in their Passenger Locator Forms but did not think they needed one for two-year-old Antonio.However, at the check-in, they were given a form to fill in for the toddler and then went through security as normal, Bristol Live reports.Has something similar happened to you  Email webnews@mirror  Leigh said: We were pushing Antonio in his pushchair and when we got to the bottom of the steps to the plane, I carried him up the steps, and a guy with the ground crew took the pushchair and put it with the rest of the luggage to go on the plane. The family from Long Ashton, near Bristol, settled down for a routine flight, landed in Lisbon and thought nothing untoward had happened until they waited an hour in vain for their luggage to arrive at Lisbon Airport. When they contacted easyJet, they were left fuming as they were told the airline had taken their luggage, car seat and pushchair off the plane. Leigh and Irene were stunned when easyJet said it was because their systems had flagged that the three passengers had been denied boarding at the exact moment they were settling down on board the plane. The dad-of-one said: I phoned up easyJet and said aposweaposre in Lisbon, can you send on our baggage apos and they said aposno you werenapost on the plane, you were denied boarding, your boarding passes werenapost scanned, so we took your stuff off the planeapos.  We had no idea. Looking back, they were more concerned with making sure everyone had their Passenger Locator Forms than they were actually checking us in and scanning our boarding passes, and they said we never boarded, but we did, we flew on the plane and we’re here in Spain. Iaposve had an email from easyJet saying apossorry you didnapost get your flightapos, and then another email askingwe’ll be getting theflight. Itaposs really concerning. Leigh said he is worried about safety on planes as well because nobody checkedtheir seats were actually empty. He explained: There are Civil Aviation Authority rules about knowing exactly who is on every flight. If that plane had to make a forced landing or we all had to be evacuated or something, they wouldn’t have looked for us, they thought we weren’t on board.  The captain of that plane should not have taken off because they had a list of people they thought were on the plane and we were on the plane but not on their list. Why, when they got the order to take our stuff off the plane because they thought we werenapost on it, didnapost they check our seats  They would have found us sitting in them. Due to the incident, Leigh, Irene and little Antonio were left without their belongings, so they were forced to buy a car seat and a pushchair in Portugal. Leigh said: My we is seven months pregnant at the moment. All our stuff for the wedding, suits, dresses, presents and so on, was in our luggage so we didn’t have that for the wedding on Saturday and we have the clothes we came in. I’ve lost luggage before - once I flew back from New York and the airline managed to get it to me in Bristol the next day. This is dferent. easyJet have refused to send it to us because they said we are not out here, when we did fly on their plane. In Spain we’ve got nothing, and over the weekend they were not even saying when or eventhey will send over our luggage. Iaposve been on the phone to easyJet a lot, obviously, and one woman was questioning that we were really in Spain. She said their records showed that we had been denied boarding, and hadnapost flown, but we did - we were on that flight. Thataposs really worrying, that that could happen. Itaposs been four days now and they called again on Monday to ask what the address is weaposre staying at. So hopefully it will all be sent over, but we have plans to go to another address this week, and what do we do  Everything is wrecked, the wedding and our trip so far. EasyJet told The Mirror that the problem occurred at the gate during boarding and an investigation is ongoing. The airline said the luggage has since been delivered and the company has apologised to the family for the delay. EasyJet said in a statement: easyJet works closely with all of our airports and partners to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and crew.We have launched an investigation with our ground handling partners at Bristol Airport to understand what happened in this instance and have apologised to Mr Husband and Ms Garcia Santos for the delay in reuniting them with their luggage, which has since been delivered to them.The safety and well-being of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority.

For a limited time, it’s acquired an edge, a kick, a fiery twist to tantalise your tastebuds. Introducing the Zinger Popcorn Bucket.Trialled in ten lucky locations in April, it proved so popular it’s now officially launching across the UK, so that everyone can feel the burn! But where are the spice fiends who’ll be going straight off to order it, and which of us Brits are more chary with the chilli  SPICE UP YOUR LIFE KFC surveyed the nation’s spice preferences, asking residents in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, London, the North East, North West, Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, South East and South West how spicy they like their food. The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right. But those in the South West were wrongly assumed to have the least tolerance for the tingle factor. And what about you  Can you take the heat  If you’re a dance-till-dawn, touch-of-the-hedonist kind of person who loves food that makes your eyes widen and your tongue take notice, the Zinger Popcorn Bucket is your order of dreams. If you get your kicks from breaking in your new lambswool slippers in front of Call the Midwe, and your flavour frisson comes from a sprinkling of parsley... maybe not so much.

Or cry because  months into a pandemic and the misery caused by lockdowns, isolation, bereavements, job losses and other money woes, we now find ourselves unable to go out because we have no petrol.“How is le in England ” my uncle from Karachi asked the other day. “Well, we have food and fuel shortages and I had to wait a month for an emergency blood test,” I replied. “And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” How the tables have turned. Great Britain has now become a great big joke. Secretary of State for Culture Nadine Dorries can tweet all she likes about how ‘THERE IS NO FUEL SHORTAGE’ butthe pumps have run dry then more fuel her. Do you agree with Anila  Have your say in the comments below Ministers are desperately throwing out ideas to avert this crisis, such as drafting in the Army and issuing , short term visas, but why would anyone from Europe answer our SOS when they were so inhumanely treated before They fare much better in other European countries and aren’t treated like dirt.There are also plans afoot to introduce training programmes so that people here can learn to be HGV drivers even though haulage company bosses have long been warning about a shortage of workers.And surelyit was that appealing we wouldn’t have had a shortage in the first place  It feels like history is about to repeat itself. In the s and aposs my parents’ generation were told that this country needed them. War had decimated the economy and immigrants from the colonies were needed to rebuild the nation. They faced deep hostility from some native Brits who put up signs on their doors like ‘No dogs, no Irish, no Pak…’ Still, they kept the wheels of industry turning by enduring horric conditions working in the ‘dark satanic mills’ and kept the country moving by driving buses and working as conductors.  This time it is not war which has caused shortages but the utter incompetence of the Tory government who have been in power for over a decade. Brexit cost billions and yet we are all so much worse off than before. Sono-one from Europe wants to be humiliated again, where do you think the drivers will come from  I would not be surprisedpeople from the Asian subcontinent and former colonies will be expected to fill the vacancies, the absolute last thing that the diehard Brexiteers wanted in the first place. Or, just like our elders who came to drive buses, will our youngsters now be told they need to retrain as HGV drivers  Suddenly it has gone very quiet from those who were highly vocal about ‘them foreigners coming here and taking all our jobs’. It was always the jobs that no-one  wanted and now there is no-one to do them. When it comes to sorting out this mess who exactly is in the driving seat  Because it sure as hell isn’t the Tories.

In a rare interview, Carole has talked about her business and said she has no plans to slow down now she is .  And during the chat, she revealed that the lightbulb moment for creating her business came as she struggled to find any decent party supplies in shops for Kateaposs fth birthday party.She told the Daily Mail : All I could find were basic clown plates.I realised there was a gap in the market for partyware that wasnapost too expensive and which looked good, so decided to design my own. I took some prototypes to ious High Street retailers and was turned away. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .However, despite being turned away from retailers, Carole knuckled down, set up her business and began handing out leaflets at her daughtersapos school - and the firm took off. She added: Thirty-five years later, Iaposm launching the Party Pieces collection. I suppose some things are worth the wait! So rather than slowing down, this is an exciting new chapter for me. I think Iaposll always be interested in party trends. Carole juggles running her business with being a grandmother to Kateaposs three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, as well as other daughter Pippaaposs two children Arthur and Grace. Earlier this month, son James married his new we Alizée Thevenet in a beautul ceremony in the south of France.The doting grandmother has previously spoken about how much she enjoys spending time with the children, telling Good Housekeeping how she likes to play games with them and muck around.She also explained how she enjoys cooking, dancing and going on bike rides with all her grandchildren. Royal expert Katie Nicholl said: One of the things that allows William and Kate to be so ordinary is the presence of the Middletons in their lives. Carole is a regular through those golden gates at Kensington Palace, she whizzes through in her Land Rover. There is no security because everybody knows her.

Matthew Jeffrey, , will be left with only £ a month to live on when the funds are cut back - equalling just £. each day, LeedsLive reports. He had worked as a sales manager for eight years before being illegally evicted from his home after losing his job three years ago. Since then Matthew has relied on charities and churches for help and is slowly beginning to get back on his feet, but fears the cut - which will see his monthly income fall from £ to £ - will stop him in his tracks. He said: “It’s [UC] been a leline for a few years. I’ve been struggling to survive with Universal Credit and now it going to get cut.  “I already don’t pay for my gas, I already cut it out. “That extra £ doesn’t seem like a lot but to me it is.” Matthew often relies on food parcels from the Food Aid Network and he even has to sell his items to pawn shops for extra cash. Matthew added he would like to go back to work but because of his long-term mental health, he is unable to work. He continued: I used to be a sales manager, I got illegally evicted. The landlord changed my locks with notice I ended up at the Crypts.  I got involved with the church and they got me back on my feet on a suitable level. I got back to having a nice house somewhere to live but I’ve just not been able to get back to work. The financial support to get back into training or something would help. Living on £ a week is impossible at the moment. We’re meant to be a rich country. “With a bit of support, counselling back into work I could quite easily get back into work. “I’m not looking for work because I’m trying to survive every day. Speaking directly to the government, he said: “Don’t cut Universal Credit, I’m laughing but it’s not funny really. “It’s going to be a big dference for a lot of people.”The £ a week uplt was brought in at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in  for a year and was extended in March this year, but is due to end by October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown no signs of reversing plans for the £ reduction, suggesting it could only be keptpaid for by tax hikes. It is estimated tens of millions of people will be left unable to afford to buy basic household necessities when the cut is brought in. Just one in  people back slashing Universal Credit, according to an Opinium poll for the New Economics Foundation.The think tank says that “when the uplt is removed, . million people, including seven million children, will live in households that do not have the amount they need to afford all the basics”.

Jemma, who also competes in triathlons in her spare time, lives with her train service controller husband, Mark, , their children, Louis, , Magnus, four, and Bronwen, three. Speaking of her shock diagnosis, Jemma said it was Covid that “saved [her] le”. “Had I been working and not been off, I would have just carried on as normal,” she said. “I’ve been quite lucky. Jemma, who has now had three rounds of surgery to remove her cancerous tumours, succumbed to Covid- while she was training for a triathlon in October . She was “knocked sideways,” she said, struggling to get upstairs and even to breathe. A month later, she was still suffering with a sore throat and had noticed a lump in her neck, so decided to see a doctor, thinking she had Long Covid. Phoning her GP, Jemma was asked to come in for blood tests and an examination and was swtly referred for an ultrasound at Ellesmere Port Hospital four days later. Just  hours after that, her doctor called to tell her a “suspicious nodule” had been found on her thyroid, a small gland at the base of the neck that produces hormones. The doctor was also concerned by her backache and the blood she had passed in her urine. She said: “I travel a lot by car for work, so I do get water infections when I can’t get to the loo when I need to, as it puts pressure on the bladder. Driving can also give me back pain. Suggesting she could have kidney stones, which can also be linked to the thyroid, her GP sent her for a further ultrasound on her right kidney – only for a mass to be detected on the organ. Following an MRI and CT scan, Jemma was called into the hospital on New Year’s Eve, . “They told me it was suspected cancer and that they’d need to operate as soon as possible,” she said. Transferred to Merseyside’s Arrowe Park Hospital in Birkenhead, Jemma’s partial kidney removal – a procedure known as a nephrectomy – was scheduled for mid-February , but because of Covid, was delayed to March . Meanwhile, her ear, nose and throat specialist was keen to operate on her thyroid but, with her kidney being a major organ, medics agreed to prioritise this procedure first. Jemma, who had to isolate for ten days prior to and ten days after her surgery, said having her kidney out was “tough” both physically and mentally. Getting up and walking hurt, she said, and she struggled to go to the toilet so needed a catheter put in. She was also left with six scars on her abdomen. Once she was back on her feet, she went under the kne again – this time for surgery on her thyroid, as neither form of cancer was treatable in her case with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. On May , at the Countess of Chester Hospital, in Chester, Cheshire, surgeons removed half, then all of her thyroid, finding papillary thyroid cancer – the most common type – on the right side of the organ. Her second operation was performed four weeks later on June , at the same hospital, followed by checks on her lymph nodes. Now awaiting further scans on her thyroid and kidneys, which she will have every three, six and  months for the next  years, to monitor for regrowth, she also takes daily thyroid medication to replace the thyroxine hormone the organ made. “Medics will perform regular blood tests, too, which would show any regrowth or thyroid hormones occurring naturally – which I shouldn’t have, as I now don’t have the organ,” Jemma explained.  “My kidney wasn’t great news when they did the biopsy, as a little bit has been possibly left in – but I was told it is a slow-growing cancer.” Jemma said she was “still really tired” with a lot of back pain, but said that “all things considered” she was in great shape. However, another concern for Jemma is a nodule which has been spotted on her right lung. She was undergoing regular full-body scans to keep an eye on the size, and was also looking into genetic testing, to find out whether she is biologically prone to any other forms of the disease. Jemma is now readjusting to normal le – and getting back to her usual active lestyle – taking part in the Macmillan Mighty Hike last month, walking  miles across the Lake District with her husband and a close friend, to thank the Macmillan nurses who supported her throughout her treatment. “That was horrendous,” she laughed. “It was really tough, but mentally did me the world of good just being able to show myself that I could still get out there and do things.” She also hosted a Macmillan coffee morning on Saturday, September  to support the cancer charity, which is encouraging people to get together with friends and family to raise funds during the month. She had also been focusing on having some fun as a family, getting out for some bonding time and even touring London to take in the sights. Jemma’s message to anyone with similar mysterious symptoms is crystal clear - don’t ignore symptoms, hoping they will just go away. “The sooner they find these things the sooner they can deal with them,” she said. Sarah Page, from Macmillan, also stresses the need to have any troublesome symptoms checked by a doctoryou feel anything could be wrong. “It has been a dficult  months and we’ve lost time in cancer care,” she added. At Macmillan we’ve lost over a year of vital fundraising. We’re sadly down by millions, which is money desperately needed.”“ Coronavirus will leave a lasting legacy for cancer care. If we are going to be there for everyone with cancer from day one, we need your support.”Comment MORE ON TriathlonCancerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Montel Nowhia-Job, , caused “severe psychological damage” to victims Andy Hillerby and Mauricy Malczewski. Nowhia-Job set fire to Andyaposs sleeping bag outside the Crisis Centre on in Croydon, South London at about am.He had a lighter and appeared to ignite a paper ball before deliberately placing it next to the man, MyLondon reports. He and his companion then walked away, leaving the sleeping man to catch alight. This victim’s sleeping bag was destroyed, along with some items of clothing and important identication documents. About an hour later he set fire to Mauricyaposs hoody as he slept.  Sean Sullivan, prosecuting, said: The victim stated he awoke as he felt hot on his head. He looked at his clothes which were on fire, he could smell smoke and he could see sparks coming from his head. He tried to extinguish the fire by patting his head with his left hand, causing burns. In a statement, Andy, who suffers from spina bida, told how he lost his walking stick and colostomy bag in the fire and had to wait to get them replaced.  He said: Since the incident, I have had fits and flashbacks, I suffer from panic attacks and my heartbeat has been out of control sometimes. “I feel so low all the time, I feel so sad about what has happened. It hurts so much, I feel so hopeless. I used to be strong but now I feel I have got no strength. I feel my soul has gone and it has reduced me to a shaking mess.” Mauricy said he had lost around £ in the fire but he said the impact on his mental health was more serious.  He said in a statement: “This has affected me the most mentally, I canapost leave anything with anybody anymore. I have trouble sleeping, I canapost eat, I canapost sleep. Iaposm constantly aware and alert, Iaposm afraid for my le now. These are things I didnapost think of before I was set on fire. I always think of why this happened to me andit could happen again. Mentally this has ripped me apart.” Nowhia-Job was arrested two days later by police after he was caught on CCTV wearing a distinctive tracksuit. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.The court heard Nowhia-Job has previous convictions for robbery, assault and burglary and was on licence for a robbery sentence at the time of the arson attacks. A psychiatrist assessed Nowhia-Job ahead of sentencing and found he had a lack of empathy for his victims and may have ADHD and Anti-Social Personality Disorder. According to the psychiatrist, the defendant is “not motivated to change his behaviour or lestyle”.  Tim Bass, defending, said Nowhia-Job is remorseful for his actions two years on and said his client was homeless himself at the time and has had a dficult upbringing. Robert Levack, from the CPS, said: “People who are homeless are already vulnerable because they do not have a safe place to call home. “Montel Nowhia-Job’s actions were frightening, reckless and could have had grave consequences for these men. Although neither of the victims received serious injuries, they have both suffered signicant psychological trauma as a result of these arson attacks. “I hope this prosecution goes some way to reassuring those sleeping rough that they should report crimes against them to the police, and that the CPS will support them by taking their cases to court where there is the evidence to do so.” Nowhia-Job admitted two counts of arson being reckless to endanger le after the attacks in June  in Croydon, South London. Judge Adam Hiddleston branded Nowhia-Job a dangerous offender as he was caged for five years at Southwark Crown Court. The judge told Nowhia-Job: “The damage you inflicted psychologically has clearly been considerable and no doubt will be long lasting. “The probation worker describes how you sought to describe your actions as a joke - something done to show off to your companion, and to show you were a big man. She says being involved in these two attacks was something you enjoyed.” The judge added: “I’m satisfied you are someone who is clearly capable of doing specied and serious crime, members of the public who cross your path are at considerable risk of serious harm.” Comment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtMental healthCrimeArson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Redborne Upper School and Community College in Ampthill, Beds., sent a form that appeared to be a checklist with NHS branding to pupilsapos homes ahead of them receiving a Covid jab. But they later realised it was fake and appears to have been circulated by vaccine opponents. School leaders across England have been cautioned to look out for similar letters, which include negative claims about the vaccine.Redborne headteacher Olly Button asked parents to ignore the letter after accidentally sending it on Monday, BBC reports. The consent checklist claimed to be from NHS Vaccines and had a -point list of concerns about the vaccine.  The vaccine is being offered to  to -year-olds across the UK this term. In a letter to parents after the checklist was sent out on Monday, Mr Button said: Apologies for any confusion or unnecessary stress caused by [the] earlier communication sent by Redborne on behalf of what at first sight appears to be the NHS. The email and attachment were sent in error and include a student consent checklist for Covid-. This is not from the NHS and is believed to be from a group wishing to disrupt the vaccination programme.  He asked parents to ignore the original email and checklist, and pupils will be spoken to about it Tuesday. Some  million youngsters are now eligible for the Covid vaccine as part of wider Government efforts to battle the virus this winter. The rollout has started in England, Scotland and Wales, and in Northern Ireland the vaccinations are expected to be offered from October. It comes as parents are being warned against hoax Covid- vaccine consent letters sent to schools in England that aim to spread anti-vaccine misinformation. Some headteachers have reportedly been targeted by letters under a fake NHS logo, which they are asked to share with parents and students. The letters are presented as being a consent form and include a consent checklist” alongside information to be sent to parents ahead of pupils receiving a vaccine. But the checklist includes a series of negative claims about the risks of vaccinations to young people. Below an NHS Vaccines logo, the letter lists claims such as the vaccine being a risk for strokes, blindness, deafness, clotting, miscarriages, anaphylaxis and cardiovascular disorders. These hoax letters are not being sent out by the NHS, said NHS England medical director for Covid immunisation, Dr Jonathan Leach, after one parent shared a checklist on Twitter. The DHSC said any unauthorised use of the NHS logo was taken very seriously, according to the BBC. A DHSC spokesperson said: ”Misinformation about the vaccine is dangerous and costs lives. We are continuing to do everything we can, working with local authorities and our NHS, to counter the spread of untruths with public information that is grounded in science and facts.” Comment MORE ON BBCNHSEducationSchoolsCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Office for National Statistics Infection Survey also reveals that younger age groups were more likely to test positive as were people who never wore a face covering indoors.According to the data those who have received two shots of the Pfizer vaccine were  per cent less likely to test positive for Covid compared to someone without any vaccine.For Moderna the figure is  per cent and for AstraZeneca it is  per cent.The study looked at data from between August  to September  this year, and included , participants testing positive out of , participants from all across the UK. According to theProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, said: I donapost think thereaposs anything particularly surprising or new in the headline findings in the ONS article, based on data from the infection survey.The headline findings for that fortnight, briefly, are that vaccinated people were less likely to test positive, and people in households of three or more, younger people, people who never wore face coverings indoors, and people who had more social contacts were all more likely to test positive. None of that is surprising.Dr James Doidge, senior statistician at the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre, added: As one of the largest surveys of randomly sampled iniduals in the world focusing on Covid-, the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey is one of the most valuable resources on the planet.Latest government data for new infections show that on Monday there were , new cases of the virus identied.

Karla Heathcote had just given then--month-old daughter Willow Dodd a bath when she saw a protruding lump on her labia . A doctor advised the mum, from Alnwick, Northumberland, to keep an eye on it but didnapost think it was anything serious.However, over time the lump got bigger and turned blue, though Willow never seemed bothered by it, reports ChronicleLive. “Things started to change when she had a couple of recurring colds, explained Karla, . Despite numerous doctors appointments and being referred, it was just thought to be a cyst and antibiotics prescribed. But I knew this wasn’t normal.”  In May , after months of not knowing what was wrong, Willow was diagnosed with stage  Rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer of the soft tissue, with the primary tumour in her labia. Further tests showed the cancer had already spread to her pelvic lymph nodes and there were signs of cancer in her stomach and up to her chest. Karla, who is also mum to boys Ollie, Joey and Louie, with partner Graeme Dodd, said: “From the moment she was diagnosed it was a whirlwind and I don’t really remember much of it.  It was so hard to believe as Willow was so well within herself and not poorly. To hear such a devastating diagnosis was so shocking.” Willow was admitted to Newcastle ’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, and just days after her diagnosis had an operation before beginning chemotherapy. Tragically, due to the urgent need to start treatment there was no time to help save her fertility, so she will no longer be able to bear her own children when she’s older. Karla said even though saving her le was the most important thing, it breaks her heart to see Willow playing with her dolls and knowing that option has been taken her away. Willow required intensive chemotherapy, surgery to remove the pelvic lymph nodes and radiotherapy. This meant over the months that followed having treatment, she spent many weeks in hospital away from her brothers and home. Karla added: “It was such a dficult time for everyone in our family especially for us all to be apart. Willow, now three years old, completed her treatment in December  and is in remission. She continues to have scans every three months and she has started nursery. Her mum described her as incredible. Willow’s family are now urging people to clear out their wardrobes as part of TK Maxx’s Give Up Clothes for Good campaign, in support of Cancer Research UK for Children  Young People for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.Find out more or donate online at cruk.org childrenandyoungpeople.

At the stroke of a pen, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to make a dramatic U-turn, offering temporary three-month visas to foreign lorry drivers and poultry workers in a bid to tackle the petrol and food shortage. Christmas is coming, you see. The Government needs to ensure we have fuel in our cars, food on our tables, booze in our shops and presents around our trees. Just like the black England footballers who came up short in this summer’s European Championship Final, immigrants are welcomed when they are useful – and discarded when we’re not. Probably, in the case of those EU drivers, on Boxing Day when they’ll start being demonised again. Trouble is, those already exiled are delivering a long, slow, lingering two fingers up to Johnson and his incompetents who are convinced they will come stampeding back into a country that doesn’t want them. The man from the Dutch road hauliers association summed it up deliciously on Radio  yesterday morning. “The EU drivers I speak to will not come on temporary visas to drag the UK out of the s*** they created for themselves,” he said. Quite right, too. Who knew that this country would eventually be forced, once again, to its knees before having to acknowledge the crucial contributions of foreigners  It’s asthe Sixties, the Seventies and the Eighties never happened. Yes, a crucial takeaway from this entire Brexit dog’s dinner is the need to appreciate the importance of British lorry drivers. For far too long they’ve been underpaid, working anti-social hours, often in awful conditions. Now, with McDonalds out of milkshake, pubs running low on beer, one in six adults unable to buy essential items of food and queues snaking around the block at petrol pumps across the land, something is finally starting to give. The politicians, the erstwhile cheerleaders – and even some broadcasters – are bending over backwards not to call it Brexit. And yes, there may well be other contributory factors. But the overriding common denominator is the xenophobia that has left this country starting to implode. It is down to the Government’s determination to detach us from our European neighboursthat we will likely have turkey shortages ahead of Christmas – while blood tests could be limited with the NHS’s biggest supplier of sample bottles running low because of “transportation challenges” and “UK border challenges”. Across this weekend we saw fights on petrol station forecourts, people taking their lives into their own hands by filling up plastic bottles with the stuffand heard fuel drivers’ tales of being followed by desperate motorists tracking their every turn. Instead of owning up to the shambles of their own making, the Government and its apologists are lashing out at Shadow Chancellor Angela Rayner for using a term used so often to describe Johnson by ordinary people – probably even by the families of his own he has walked out on - it’s a wonder his ears haven’t melted. This nightmare has been a long time coming. My own parents and relatives came here as part of a Windrush generation that helped rebuild this country in the Sixties and Seventies, yet is now being demonised. Today’s “bloody foreigners” have no intention of subjecting themselves to similar manipulation. Good for them.

The App Drivers and Couriers Union organised the strike, claiming workers are being unfairly dismissed and that the company failed to implement a court ruling to pay waiting time - which the union says makes up around  per cent of an Uber driveraposs working time. It is also in dispute over the introduction of fixed price fares which it claims has led to reduced driver incomes. The ADCU has asked people to support the strike by not booking the service today. Uber insisted it is working with unions to raise standards for drivers.  The union said in a statement: On September , , the ADCU will stage a -hour national strike against Uber over poor pay  conditions, unfair dismissals and failure to implement the UK Supreme Court ruling. Please support the strike by not booking the service and by making alternative travel arrangements on September th. Thank you for your cooperation and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. Please share this message. ADCU president Yaseen Aslam said: It is shameful that Uber continues to defy the highest court in the land to cheat , workers out of pay for  per cent of their true working time. The drivers know they deserve and are legally entitled to much more than Uber is offering. This strike is just the beginning and there will be much more unrest until Uber does the right thing and pays drivers all that they are owed, both pension contributions and working time. General secretary James Farrar added: Uber has continued to intensy its use of junk surveillance tech and algorithmic management control to maximise profits. The results have been catastrophic, with hundreds of people unfairly dismissed and accused of unspecied aposfraudulent activityapos. Instead of trying to gag unions from exposing the flaws in their tech, Uber should instead guarantee all drivers protection from unfair dismissal and the right to access a proper, human-led appeals process. An Uber spokesperson said: Following the historic trade union recognition deal with GMB, drivers have an even stronger voice within Uber. We are working together with our trade union partner to raise standards for drivers through greater transparency and engagement. GMB represents drivers in areas such as earnings, deactivations and the implementation of new worker benefits, such as holiday pay and pensions.It comes after Uber announced in March that , drivers will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage, with paid-for holiday time.Those eligible will also be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. The Silicon Valley-based company said its drivers in London, one of its most important markets, earn £ per hour on average and the flexibility to choose , when and where they work will be retained. Uber has faced opposition from traditional taxi operators and unions have criticised the app for undercutting existing players, leading to protests and regulatory and legal challenges which have forced the company to pull out of some markets. The Mirror has contacted Uber for further comment.

Unions called on No to allow key workers to fill up first at petrol stations, as panic-buying continued yesterday. And as Tories yet again blamed drivers for the crisis, there were warnings that foreign drivers are likely to snub ­Transport Secretary Grant’s Shapps’ offer of temporary visas to help ease the crisis. GMB union national officer Rachel Harrison said: “During this completely avoidable crisis, petrol must be ­prioritised for those key workers who save lives and keep the country moving.” What do you think of the current fuel frenzy  Have your say in the comments  UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea added: “Ambulance crews, nurses, care workers, teaching assistants, police staff and other key workers mustn’t be left stranded or forced to queue for hours simply to get to a pump.” The British Medical Association warned there was a “real risk NHS staff won’t be able to do their jobs”. And the Royal College of Nursing said the fuel supply problems could lead to patient care being compromised. Bethany Kelly, a diabetes specialist nurse at the Solent NHS Trust, visited three petrol stations without luck. And with only nine miles left in the tank, she found herself queuing for  minutes at a station rationing fuel to £. Bethany managed to get £ worth after showing her NHS badge.  She said: “We work closely with community nurses, there’ll be going out to give insulin to patients and these patients can’t survive without it.” Police officers were spotted jumping a queue at a petrol station in Hackney, East London. The Met defended the move. It said: “We had to jump the queue, our cars are empty.”On Saturday night an ambulance on an emergency call was filmed crashing into a car queuing outside pumps in Bromley, South London.Paramedics had to swap details with the driver, delaying their vital journey. George Eustice tried to blame drivers for the chaos, despite No being warned in June by road haulage chiefs that a HGV crisis was looming.The Environment Secretary said: “The only reason we don’t have petrol on the forecourts is that people are buying petrol when they don’t need to.” Up to % of filling stations in some parts are said to have now run dry. Sales of jerry cans have soared as people try to stockpile fuel. There were reports of drivers following fuel tankers to garages.Thieves even allegedly drilled holes in parked cars in Birmingham to steal fuel. Surrey county council is considering declaring a major incident in response to the supply crisis.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Leader leader Tim Oliver said it would give them “powers to ­prioritise key workers”.

David Handy, , Mateus Natkowski, , and Lukasz Wywrinsk, , were convicted following three trials in the UKaposs largest ever modern slavery prosecution and what is believed to be the biggest of its type in Europe. A court heard up to  workers were trafficked into Britain with  promises of wealth and a better le before being made to live in squalor and payments of p an hour. They were forced to reside in dirty bedsits across the West Midlands while working for a pittance and were beaten or threatenedthey refused to work or complained. One man was paid just £ for working up to  hours a day for three weeks, while their exploiters kept the rest of their hard-earned wages.  Recruitment agency boss Handy made almost £ million supplying slave labour to parcels firm XDP sent to him by their Polish gang masters. Handy - who ran recruitment firm ASAP   Ltd - skimmed off some of his victimsapos earnings before paying wages directly into their exploitersapos bank accounts. He also received back-handers from the traffickers for agreeing to find work placements for victims who were under their control. Handy, of Stoke-on-Trent, paid off his mortgage and other debts after raking in over half a million pounds and was also able to amass savings of around £,. He was jailed for seven years at Birmingham Crown Court last Friday after being found guilty of conspiracy to force people into forced labour, conspiracy to traffic people for the purpose of exploitation and money laundering. Natkowski and Wywrinsk, who lived on James Turner Street, made famous by the Channel  documentary Benefits Street, were described as trusted enforcers.  They made £ million while using violence and threats to intimidate victims and keep them in line with both verbal and physical abuse. Wyrwinski, who was known as Diable, Polish for devil, admitted conspiracy to force people into forced labour, conspiracy to traffic people for the purpose of exploitation and money laundering. Natkowski was found guilty of the same charges following a trial and they were both jailed for more than four years on Friday. Also in court alongside the trio was Shane Lloyd, , who began to launder money for Handy in a bid to prevent his illicit gains from being discovered. Nearly £, was paid into a Lloydaposs bank account, which he then cashed and passed back to Handy. Lloyd, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering. He was handed a  month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do  hours of unpaid work. The Polish gang masters behind the operation were jailed for a total of  years in July  following the biggest slavery and trafficking investigation ever in the UK. Detectives found victims had their documents seized, fed out-of-date food and forced to scavenge for dumped mattresses to sleep on. At some properties there were no working toilets, heating, furniture or hot water and some victims told how they were forced to wash in canals. Handy - the only British member of the conspiracy to be charged - was introduced to the gang masters in  and later supplied workers to XDP in Sutton Coldfield.  Detective Chief Inspector Nick Dale, of West Midlands Police, said: Handy was an integral part of the crime gang, finding work for the victims and maximising their exploitation. He made far more money than any legitimate employment agent would have been able to - and there was evidence the gang also gave him £ for each victim he employed. Handy made a signicant amount of money while the victims - aged from  to a man in his s - effectively worked for just  pence an hour. He also went to considerable effort to protect himself, creating worthless contracts and filming himself informing workers of their rights, when in reality he was instrumental in taking away those rights. An investigation was launched in  when two victims bravely broke free from their captors and disclosed offences to slavery charity Hope for Justice. Paul McAnulty, UK  Europe Programme Director at Hope for Justice, said: Human traffickers profit from the misery and desperation of others, exploiting vulnerabilities in good people. This exploitation is often perpetuated by a network of others who choose to look the other way, fail to live up to their responsibilities or, worse, are actively complicit in these crimes.  Employers, retailers, labour providers, landlords, banks, consumers, all of us owe a duty of care - we must collectively look to shine a light on the abhorrent and reprehensible crime of modern slavery. Hope for Justice is proud of our role in working alongside West Midlands Police and partners to bring an end to this particular gangaposs activities, and in assisting the survivors to freedom and supporting them towards their preferred futures. Neil Fielding, specialist prosecutor from CPS West Midlands, said: The extent to which this gang callously exploited and deprived their victims of basic human rights is truly appalling. The scale of the suffering they inflicted on huge numbers of mainly vulnerable people is dficult to comprehend. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the many witnesses who gave evidence in this series of trials for their bravery in coming forwards and for continuing to support the case. I would also like to thank the Polish authorities for their assistance in this case.

York Gins is owned and run by Emma Goala, , Pete McNichol, , Paul Crossman, , and -year-old Harry Cooke. Speaking to us following the good news, they said: We’re absolutely delighted to win the prize. As a small business in these very strange and uncertain times, any help we can get is very welcome. We couldn’t quite believe we’d won when we were contacted! We’re pretty used to winning gin-tasting competitions - but this was out of the blue. We think our business is special because we put people, the planet and fun at the very heart of everything we do. We pay the Living Wage and make sure everyone is fully trained and gets any outside training they may need. York Gin only launched in  but has also grown rapidly. The team added: When we started, two of us were working in a cold former chicken shed, making the gin and bottling, labelling and packing everything by hand. We had a good hunch that the local market would provide some demand for a locally-made gin - in fact one of our directors, Paul, is a pub landlord, so we thought at least we’ll have one customer!The team are looking forward to using the new Square Stand Kit, adding: We are always interested in trying new solutions to tricky problems like payments. The loyalty programme Square offers looks particularly interesting.We have plans to grow - but in a controlled and sustainable manner. We have plans to open a second shop in York. We already have a shop in the historic centre right opposite the famous Shambles and now plan a new shop in the city’s train station. We have ambitions to grow our online store too which Square could help us with.

The business has come a long way since then, claiming a  square foot workshop and a shop space, but it’s during the next exciting phase that the Square technology will be invaluable. Last year, Corinne Webb, , came on board to help Ollie with his workload, brining with her a wealth of experience in textiles and interior design, and the pair quickly realised they made a fantastic team, and decided to go into partnership together to expand and rebrand as Clueit Webb Interiors.  “We are going to be adding extra products to the website and physical shop,” said the duo. “The Square kit will really help us keep track of stock and give us a real understanding of what is selling and what isnapost, and help us decide what we should be restocking. “Plus, the fact that it links up to our accounting software and keeps track of sales on social media will be beyond helpful.” Having combined their years of experience in upholstery, vintage furniture sourcing, textiles and interior design, Ollie and Corinne are able to offer unique and exciting services and products to clients nationally, as well as in the south east. “We have a hands-on approach, working really closely with clients,” they explain. “We have a passion for restoring peopleaposs furniture and helping them craft homes that are a true reflection of our clientsapos tastes.”  With that in mind, Ollie and Corinne are looking to open a larger shop space, take on additional staff and signicantly expand their online presence. And the ability to upgrade the Square software and expand the Square services will make the management of these additional areas so much easier. “We are delighted to win this prize,” they told us. “Our previous POS was very basic and offered no integration with our online store and accounting software, so it will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us.” aposWeaposre over the moon - Square’s architecture is easily scalableapos - Outdoor Fire Pits, Nottinghamshire Husband and we duo Tony and Kate Cox set up their business in  on the eve of Tonyaposs th and say winning our Square bundle will help them continue to grow.

Weaposre on the brink of taking on some staff to run our retail shop, which would mean investing in some permanent payment taking hardware, as to date, we’ve each had a card reader paired with our phone. The Square Register will give us that permanent asset which anyone who runs the shop can use without needing an app on their phone. Secondly, we’ve seen an increase in the number of people who ask to order and pay by phone, which is something missing from our current offering, which will be resolved by Square. Tony and Kateaposs business is booming and has come a long way in a short amount of time. Tony added: Five years ago, we started manufacturing in a tiny  square foot rented barn building, with a lot of time spent on design and selling a couple units per month. We then doubled the size of our space. During the  lockdown to keep up with growth, we successfully partnered with some local welding schools and have now negotiated new partnerships which have given us the capacity to supply a number of garden centres in addition to our own direct sales.

Itaposs not just the endless traffic jams, dealing with other road users and the low pay, it also changes you as a person the longer you do it. I used to be quite sociable during my time in the RAF, but after I left to have a family and took up driving for a living, I became more insular and inward-looking. Often youaposd barely speak to another person all day long, and that takes its toll on you mentally. Thereaposs also the physical side of things to deal with. Most drivers have little to no access to fresh food, so your entire diet is whatever you find at the service station. Unless youaposve got your own lorry with a mini fridge, you canapost get up at am and keep food chilled all day until you can pull over to eat it. I used to suffer badly with IBS, which was exacerbated by driving  hours a day, and never got time to exercise as I was exhausted by the time I got home. Driving full-time not only puts a strain on your health, but also on your relationships and family. It was very tough on my we coping with the children at home and holding down her own job while I was out on the road.  After five or six years I took a £, pay cut to get my le back, so Iaposm now earning £, a year. It might not be as much money, but I get to see my two young girls every evening and have a better work le balance. Thereaposs been talk of some recruiters paying £, a year, but youaposd be lucky to earn that even driving flat out. Your pay ranges from minimum wage for unloading cargo to around £ an hour for the unsociable hours driving shts via an agency, but my average pay was about £ a week. You can drive anything between  to  miles a day, five or six days a week. My longest job was Lincoln to Liskeard in Cornwall, then back up to Bristol, then up to Norwich, then Edinburgh, Glasgow and back to Lincoln in five days. You can easily cross the country twice in a week.  There are good and bad jobs in driving - everyone wants the ones with the fewest drops that are closest to home, but sometimes you can be sent miles and miles away on your final sht of the week. My last place stopped paying overtime as some of the workers were taking the mick, so they just paid you for am until pm, for example, and a lot of us would work through our -minute breaks so we could beat the traffic home. Youaposre constantly stressed about timings, which is one of the biggest problems in the industry. I always took my breaks as it wasnapost worth the risk to drive while tired. The facilities for lorry drivers are grim, however. It costs us up to £ to park up for more than two hours at most service stations, and the toilets are usually far away and dirty - so drivers end up relieving themselves round the back of their lorry. Thereaposs usually rubbish dumped all over the lorry park and theyaposre not very secure - sometimes opportunistic thieves will slash the curtainto see whataposs in there, which is why youaposll see some lorries with their back doors left wide open to show theyaposre empty. Every time a vehicleaposs attacked the driver has to wait for their company to come out and fix it. The showers can be unpleasant too, with nowhere to stow your clothes while you freshen up. Sometimes thereaposs just one shower for  tired drivers, so we get used to making do. It can be a very lonely occupation, just you and your thoughts for nine, ,  hours a day. If youaposre unloading at a depot you might exchange a few words with whoeveraposs signing off your paperwork, then youaposre back behind the wheel. I realised I had to leave when I got home after a week away and my toddler daughter happily skipped out to bring my duvet inside, I just thought, aposI canapost do this any moreapos. What I do miss about driving is seeing the sights of the UK. I travelled all over and saw the beautul scenery, but Iaposm so much happier now I get to take part in family le again.

As people queue up at petrol stations for hours and many are forced to go without it, one opportunist appears to have decided to try to make some cash off the back of the fuel crisis. The woman shared a post to a local Stockport community Facebook group with a photo of two petrol cans. Above it she wrote: L. e petrol. Collection from Romiley. £ Ono. Cans not included but can fill up on collection. What do you think of this  Have your say in the comments below  The price is around four times more expensive that what it would be at a pump, which is why the post was met with such anger. Is this a wind up  wrote one astonished local. The Facebook post has now been deleted. The woman was clearly trying to make money out of the current fuel shortage, which saw panicked Brits queue for hours to try to get petrol at the weekend and even fights breaking out between customers. It meant many people had to work from home today, as TomTom traffic data revealed that many cities were much quieter than usual in terms of traffic. Others braved it and started queuing for fuel as early as am. The crisis has seen key workers such as NHS staff and teachers struggle to make it into work. So much so that some petrol stations are now doing a priority two-hour slot for medical professionals - anyone attending these must show their ID. The government continues to insist people should avoid panic buying because thereaposs not actually a fuel shortage.Reports suggest Boris Johnson is considering drafting in the army to help with fuel transportation.Grant Shapps, Transport Minister, added that the problem is being caused by panic buying and it would eventually work itself out.Despite this, the chaos continues, with thieves even stealing petrol out of parked cars by punching a hole in the tank.Comment MORE ON Department for TransportBoris JohnsonGrant ShappsVehiclesPoliticsPanic-buying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr Yardley, a Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University’s Centre for Applied Criminology, shares how factors in this might include biology, neighbourhood, school, health services and their relationship with their mother.She wrote: Why such an emphasis on mothers  What about the fathers  Isnapost this sexist  These are questions that I have encountered a lot over the past few months. I argue that mothers matter more in the making of murderers because of the inherently gendered nature of society. We expect mothers to be selfless nurturers and primary caregivers - expectations we take for granted and apply to all. We defer to mothers, simply assuming that they know best and are prioritising the needs of their child, protecting them from harm both within and outside of the family. As long as mum is on the scene, surely everything will be alright   Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Not in the cases that have been examined in the series - Daniel Bartlam, Fred and Rose West, Jed Allen, Harold Shipman, Dennis Nilsen, Robert Black, Joachim Knychala, Leszek Pekalski, Adam Lanza and Richard Kuklinksi. To ying degrees, whether by act or omission, the mothers of these killers began to write the script for murder.The expert goes on to ulge how the mothers of Fred West and Robert Black among others created brutal environments at home, neglecting or abusing their children. While Shipman and Lanzaaposs mothers were determined to have the best for their children, encouraging their sons to be more like others. Through hypervigilance they tried to be the good mothers that society demands, being selective in the advice that they took on board from outsiders, Dr Yardley explains. Finally, the mothers of Bartlam, Nilsen and Rose West were in denial - looking the other way, unwilling to confront or discuss behaviours that might lead to their children being seen as aposdferentapos. From these findings, Dr Yardley concluded there were three types of mothers that can make a murderer - anti-mothers, uber-mothers and passive mothers.  Anti-mothers According to the expert, this type of mother may have been a victim of abuse and neglect, the survivor of a brutal upbringing who never had a aposhealthyapos family environment. Not all women who experience this will go on to recreate their own situation, but there are some who will. They turn from victims to aggressors themselves, becoming the same type of person they had once despised. Uber-mothers The uber-mothers come from a apostraditionalapos sort of family environment, but they are very aware of societyaposs expectations and have been from an early age. They may have been the victims of discrimination or arbitrary moral framework and as such are determined their own children will not be held back in the same way. In turn, they become mother-managers, planning out their childrenaposs lives and struggling to keep them on course. Dr Yardley describes this kind of parent as the gatekeepers that hold off the outside world, protecting their child from scrutiny as their behaviour becomes increasingly deviant. Passive mothers The third type of mother on the list is scared of how society may judge her children. They have lived their own lives following rules and doing what society expects of them, being quiet, passive and ticking along. If their children begin to cross societyaposs moral and legal boundaries, the fear of labelling compels them to try and deny what is happening. Theyaposll sweep the situation under the rug, ignoring it in hopes that it is just a phase and will go away. Dr Yardley adds: Anti-mothers, uber-mothers and passive mothers thrive because of the considerable cultural value society places on privacy. How mothers bring up their children remains largely aposnone of our businessapos. Privacy can be valuable as it allows us to restrict who has access to our family places and spaces and enables us to control who knows what about our families. However, it can also be the barrier behind which violence, abuse, neglect and denial can thrive - and the making of a murderer can begin.What do you think of the expertaposs findings  Let us know in the comments below.Comment MORE ON PsychologyParentingCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The video – which was filmed in Dublin – shows one man in the home slowly lowering the sofa toward the ground, Dublin Live reports.The other two men were standing on a low wall outside the house, and were using sweeping brushes to hold up the sofa so it didn’t come crashing down.

They manage to lower the sofa to a height where it looks like they would be to take hold of the sofa, but viewers didn’t get to seethey were ultimately successful, as the video ends with the piece of furniture still dangling in the air. But despite the unsatisfactory ending, the video’s viewers were amazed by the strange technique. One wrote: “Masters at work, hopefully it was successful!” While another said: “It worked and saved hours because it obviously didn’t fit through a door, so they would have had to take it apart. They’re big brained.” And a third posted: “That was actually pretty fantastic.” Other people didn’t find the strategy to be that weird, as they shared similar stories of their own unique ways of getting large pieces of furniture in and out of a house with narrow doorways. Someone said: “My brother and I popped out his sitting room window out last September to swap the suites. Took  minutes and the window popped straight back in.” However, some were unimpressed, with one person writing: “At that stage itaposd nearly have been faster to carry it down the stairs.” While another complained: “It would have been easier to unscrew one of the arms off.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralTikTokUmm what Funny ha ha viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old had travelled to Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland to snap the Northern Lights when she spotted the bizarre aircraft around .pm on Monday. The postie, from Linton, Morpeth, Northumberland, said: Iaposd gone in search of the Northern Lights but I couldnapost see any. I was walking back to my car when I suddenly saw this incredibly bright shape soaring up in the sky. It was amazing and grabbed my camera and started taking pictures of it. I must admit I thought the aliens were landing. Did you spot the UFO on Monday night  Let us know at webnews@mirror  The shape of it was like an angel and it was bright white. As soon as I got home I checked what it could have been and realised it was the NASA Landsat- satellite which had launched in Calornia. It was a pretty great feeling to see it from the other side of the world. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base at .am local timeon Monday.The unidentied conical object was in fact parts of the rocket re-entering the Earthaposs atmosphere, reports HullLive. Among the places sightings were reported include Hull, Leicester, Nottingham and Swansea. One witness said: It was a huge white triangle in the sky no noise at all, no planes showing up on the flight tracker, has to be something in orbit but was something Iaposve never seen before, and to say how high it was the projected light must have been miles wide. Another added: It was a triangle of light moving across the sky, it was so unnatural. Others said that where they were the object seemed to float in the sky, hovering above them for some time before it moved. A photographer from the US said the phenomena was rocket launch stage de-burnRemarkable naked eye sight like two vivid comets rapidly creeping across the background stars like phantoms, he continued.I always wanted to tick this one off my list. The Swansea UFO Network tweeted that the object was seen over the Welsh city around .pm but donapost worry, it’s the Atlas V rocket entering the atmosphere, to deliver  satellites to orbit!The rocket launched from Calornia and was last seen heading north across the U.K. The Atlas V rocket successfully carried Landsat  — a NASA satellite meant to help monitor Earth’s land and coastal regions — into orbit before separating and moving to a lower orbit to deploy rideshare Cubesats. According to NASA, Landsat  can take more than  images of Earth per day. The launch had previously been delayed because of supply chain troubles that limited access to liquid nitrogen.  In related news, physical debris from two alleged UFO crash sites over the past  years has been examined in a lab, it has been confirmed.A new state-of-the-art machine has enabled scientists at Stanford University, Calornia, to study in-depth was what collected. Metal debris from UFO cases dating as far back as  have been investigated after being obtained through on field research of supposed crashes in Colombia and Argentina.  The new “multi-parameter ion beam imager” gives scientists the chance to look at the atomic structure of a selected material.It also comes after a man in the US claimed aliens had ruined his le by inserting a nanochip in his arm. Steve Colbern claimed that he had been taken aboard a UFO “hundreds of times” by aliens that looked like “typical greys”, and that heaposs been abducted so many times that his perspective on le has changed. He blames the encounters with ending his marriage and him losing his job. Mr Colbern claims incident began when he found a UFO hovering over his avocado tree, before he was then pulled up into the spaceship by a green light beam. Then, he was led to a medical station and told to lie down and when he ed to Earth nothing was the same.

Whether youaposve seen it in its original vinyl form or on a t-shirt, itaposs hard to think of a more recognisable image in the music industry. And - surprisingly - there’s a lot of mathematics behind the album cover, with its simple geometric design and rainbow pattern.As reported by Chalkdust Magazine, the album cover shows a beam of white light hitting a triangular prism splitting into ‘constituent parts’ .It’s an example of an ‘optical phenomena’ known as refraction and dispersion, which may sound a little complicated, but it’s more understandable once you break it down. The refraction and dispersion explains why the rainbow and the incoming beam are not parallel, and how the white light splits up as it passes directly through the prism. Sean Jamshidi, a PhD student at University College London, broke down the signicant mathematical points of the album cover and found three parts to focus on. Refraction The refraction displayed in the album cover is all to do with the speed at which a beam of light travelswhich could be glass, air or water. Given the medium, mathematics can compute refractive index: N c   v In short, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and v is the speed of light through the medium. n is close to , while for glass it is about . - so light travels slower through glass than through air. Light usually takes the fastest path from A to B, and the dference in speed between air and glass means that the shortest path in terms of distance may not be the fastest one. Moving onto angles, θ and θ are measured from the normal to the material interface. Since glass has a higher refractive index than air , a light beam passing from air into glass will bend towards the normal . When the beam leaves the other side of the prism, the reverse happens and the angle increases again.Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by you can do that here.

Angles In terms of the change in angle on the prism, it can be computed by a quadrilateralIt’s an example of ‘Snell’s law’ which in the mathematical world is described as ‘a formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction’. Sean continued: “Given an entry angle θ, Snell’s law allows us to calculate θ. We can then sum up the angles in the red quadrilateral, which gives θ. “In terms of θ and the refractive indices n and n, we apply Snell’s law again at the point where the light exits to give us θ.” Colour The multi-coloured beam is about the only glimpse of colour we get in this album cover, and although it’s minimal, it’s very strong in contrast with the black background. In technical terms, Sean explained: “Where λ is the wave of the light, A and b are constants that depend on the material. “In air, the value of b is very smalland so the refractive index can be set to a constant, which means that our light beam arrives at the prism with all the colours hitting at the same place and time.” It’s clear that album cover designer Hipgnosis knew a thing or two about maths, when combining the ideas of refraction and dispersion we can calculate the exact journey that the light beam takes. So next time you listen to Pink Floyd, take a look at the album cover and prepare to have your mind blown from the maths in front of you.

One person died as a result of the quake, while a number of people are still missing. Schools, hotels and other buildings were evacuated when the . magnitude quake struck off the coast of the island on Monday morning. Many homes were damaged, with some reduced to piles of rubble.Were you affected by the earthquake  Let us know at webnews@mirrorMrs Semple, , who moved the Crete from Scotland, told Glasgow Live about her terrying experience.The earthquake was really scary and the worst I’ve felt in five years living here, she said. We have been getting small earthquakes all summer but this one was the worst. It lasted for around  seconds and the whole house was shaking. All my cupboard doors and balcony doors were rattling and you could hear everything moving. My dog was terried too.  It was my day off so I wasn’t long woken up. As soon as I realised what was happening I ran out the door to go outside. We have been feeling aftershocks all day, more than . One of the aftershocks was . magnitude yesterday and another today of .. Around , tents were set up to house those who could not safelyto their homes on Monday. Safety inspections are under way, with members of Greeceaposs disaster response unit flown in with specialised rescue equipment. But locals still fear further quakes could be coming.  Everybody is nervous as aftershocks keep continuing, she added. I know some people in the village who lost their family homes. Lots of tourists are here, so many workers are trying to continue as normal. It’s time like now I wish to be close to my family as it’s only me and my dog here, but we will be fine. We will get through it, like the Cretans always do. Seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos told Greeceaposs state broadcaster ERT: This is not an event that occurred without warning.  We have seen activity in this region for several months. This was a strong earthquake, it was not under sea but under land and affecting populated areas. One video clip shows a panicked woman telling her father to calm down and that everything was shaking. Former Met Police officer Michiela Medcraft said she was eating breakfast in her hotelaposs restaurant at Creta Maris beach resort in Crete when the quake struck. It sounded like a massive lorry was going past the hotel and then it got really loud, the -year-old told the Mirror. You just felt things shaking. I looked at my son and we both said aposthat’s an earthquakeapos. Then people just started screaming and running out of the restaurant. I didn’t expect people to react like that but I’ve never been in an earthquake.

Learn moreByBethan ShufflebothamNiche Writer:,  Sep | commentsA pet portrait artist who creates touching tributes to lost pets has left TikTok viewers in floods of tears after sharing her amazing work.Megan, who paints under the name magastrations, takes a deceased dog’s favourite toy and transforms it into a piece of artwork that their owner can keep forever. In a TikTok video that has been watched nearly five million times, she explained how, even though she doesn’t have pets, she enjoys the rewarding job that pet owners have entrusted her with. The Calornian artist said: “I’m a memorial pet portrait artist and people send me the toys of their pets who have died to paint their portrait on it. “I don’t have any pets but it breaks my heart every time I sit down to do one of these just looking at all the bite marks and the teeth marks and how much love they put into this toy.”  The video showed the process of creating a portrait of a German Shepherd on a red frisbee as she explained: “It’s really stressful because itaposs not like I can just go get another canvas.” Her work is available on Etsy, with frisbee tributes costing £., and taking up to two months to create. Megan added: “Some take longer than others, some hit me harder than others. “This is the most rewarding work that I do. Just to be a part of the grieving process is really special.”Fetch. Chase. Eat.

Repeat. is a new podcast from TeamDogs which takes a sideways look at what itaposs REALLY like bringing puppies into your le.Every week hosts Hannah Jones and Karen Price will be joined by celebrity dog owners like Strictly Come Dancingaposs Shirley Ballas and Coronation Street actress Samia Longchambon to chew over the adventures - and misadventures! - of puppy parenting.

It is feared that its mother was killed by poachers, and that it is likely that he will be experiencing confusion and shock. Andrey Gorban, director of Roev Ruchey Zoo in Krasnoyarsk, has said that the cub requires assistanceit to survive. Due to its young age, the bear cannot hunt and fend for itself as until around three-years-old, polar bears rely on their mothers for food.  This has meant that the bear has not eaten for a few days and that he has not moved despite attempts by locals to force it out using flares. “This is the most disturbing thing,” Gorban told The Siberian Times. “The bear cub looks well-groomed, very cute. “This is also a hazard factor for the bear because until three years old, the cubs have not yet been trained by their mothers to hunt, they cannot feed themselves. There are very high risks that he will simply die of hunger. The decision on what action to take has been referred to Rosprirodnadzor, Russiaaposs wildle watchdog, in Moscow. There are disagreements among experts about whether the endangered bear should be taken into captivity. Describing the current circumstances of the bear, Gorban said: “The bear just lies in one place, and practically does not go anywhere. “Sometimes the dogs chase him. He gets up, disperses the dogs and lies back down again.” “The fact that he is now handsome, well-groomed, well-fed indicates that the mother has recently disappeared. “And so he is still confused and shocked. “He does not go anywhere and waits for his mother.” Gorban believes that the bear should be taken into captivity, but this has been disputed by another expert. Dr Nikita Ovsyanikov believes that the bear should fend for itself, and that whilst it is young, it has the capability to survive independently. Dr Ovsyanikov urges locals not to feed the beast. “There is no need to take him to a nature park or a zoo,” he said. This cub has every chance to survive in its natural habitat.”Incidents such as this one have not been uncommon in Russia, with one polar bear travelling a shocking ,km earlier this year before arriving in a remote village, the furthest recorded distance travelled by a polar bear.That bear was caught and taken into captivity for treatment and evaluation, in the hopes to eventually release it back into the wild.In December ,  starving bears entered a village after warmer temperatures meant that the sea did not freeze over, and they were unable to migrate. Locals has said that the increase in winter weather had led to more instances in polar bears entering towns and villages.Comment MORE ON Polar bearsBears\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It’s a very special bit of Aberdeenshire, and it has all sorts of things going on.#Prominently featured are the hill Morven and the mountain Lochnagar, along with the Tomnaverie recumbent stone circle.Along the bottom of the work are Tarland landmarks including the old kirk, Alastrean House, Douneside and the MacRobert Hall, and there are tributes to farmers, curlers, golfers and Highland dancers decorating the edges.Among the most signicant elements on the Tarland tapestry is a fiddler, recognisable as local resident Paul Anderson, one of Scotland#s most prominent folk musicians.Mr Anderson, who was awarded an MBE earlier this year and an honorary doctorate from Robert Gordon University a few weeks ago, said: #Initially I thought it was just going to be a generic fiddle player, not necessarily myself, but when it was finished it was quite clearly myself!#So it was a bit of a surprise, I certainly wasn’t looking to be featured.#It’s very humbling actually, it#s quite a thing to see yourself depicted in an image like that, such a beautul thing.#Another pleasant surprise for Mr Anderson was the stitchers# decision to feature his composition Cromar, Her Beauty Before Me accurately notated alongside him.He said: #I suppose, much in the same way that the landscape has inspired the artists who created the images, I was reflecting looking upon the landscape where I grew up and where my ancestors came from.#It#s just a place I love dearly.#After the original unveiling date of April   was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, the work was finally revealed to the public by Dorie Wilkie during the Tarland Food and Music Festival on Sunday, and proved to be a big draw.Mrs Healey said: #Paul played Cromar, Her Beauty Before Me, and there wasn’t a dry eye in the house when he played it.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people. Participants will discover traditional building skills, learn how to guide visitors, or #takeover# the social media accounts for a museum: all with the aim of improving their future employability.The project, which runs until May , has three main strands of work: providing work experience placements for young people aged - who will study for a Trinity College Arts Award accredited workshops and events and a series of school visits.For more information, contact project co-ordinators Kirsty MacNabat kirsty@chartsargyllandisles.org or Pamela Campbellat pamela@chartsargyllandisles.org.Seymour Adams, Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles Board"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona celebrates double wins","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead golfer Fiona McLeod completed a unique double, winning Dunaverty Golf Club#s R.N.L.I Open Event with a net score of .Fiona#s victory added to her previous success in winning Dunty#s Holiday Open back in July with a net score of .

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

past few days, but what is the situation in Scotland Long queues and pump closures have wreaked havoc across the UK, but the problems arent actually related to a fuel shortage \"at the source\".Heres what you need to know...Why are there fuel shortages at petrol stations There are numerous reasons for the fuel shortages at petrol stations, but the good news is that there is no fuel shortage \"at the source\" in the UK.Instead, it was alack of HVG drivers that initially meant fuel could not reach a small number of petrol stations around the UK.BP told the UK Government last week that due to a lack of lorry drivers available to deliver fuel, it would prioritise motorway services and limit fuel delivery to keep the supply chain running.As a result, fuel was not delivered to some stations, causing the closure of some pumps.This ledto long queues and then panic buying, with supermarket Sainsburys reportinga surge in demand for fuel over the weekend as people rushed to fill up there cars.According topresident of the AA Edmund King, the shortages could pass in a few dayspeople only filled their cars when they needed and avoided panic purchasing.\"The good news is you can only really fill up once ndash yoursquove got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing,\" he said.\"Itrsquos not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc.\"So, once people have filled up, they wonrsquot travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days.\"He addedthat there\"is plenty of fuel at source\", a statement which has been reiterated by UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Scotlandsdeputy first minister John Swinney.Speaking on Sunday, Shapps said there \"is no shortage of fuel\", whileSwinney said there is an \"adequate supply of fuel to meet normal demand\" in Scotland.What is the government doing to deal with the fuel shortages According to reports, the UK Government is considering easing restrictions on immigration to allow more foreign lorry drivers to come and work in the UK on a temporary basis.A shortage of HVG drivers has been causing problems in dferent sectors over the past few months, with supermarkets also hit.The reported plans have been met with mixed reaction.Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industrydescribed the expected change in rules on visas as a \"huge relief\" but said it was a \"shamethe government needed queues at pumps to move\".However, critics of the plan suggest the government cant expect workers who were forced to leave to rush back on a temporary basis.Andy Prendergast, national officer of the GMB union, told the PA news agency: \"Five years ago this country basically told European truck drivers to get on their bike.\"Now wersquore in a crisis and we are desperate to welcome them back with open arms. Itrsquos no surprise they arenrsquot queuing up to come back to the country that slung them out.\"Changing immigration rules or relaxing driversrsquo tests is not the way to solve the HGV shortage. Paying drivers what they know they are worth, and improving appalling conditions in the industry, is.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-update-today-next-announcement-watch","story":"Nicola Sturgeons weekly update on the Covid situation in Scotlandwill take place in Parliament this afternoon.It comes as children aged - receive lettersthis week inviting them to get a single dose of the Covid vaccine.Numbers in Scotland have been dropping after weeks of high case rates, which the first minister has previously said gives reason for optimism.Last week the Scottish government confirmed that Scotlands rules on internationaltravel will remain in keeping with those of Westminster.It means that from October  there will no longer be a green or amber list, and that travellers from non red-listed countries will not be required to take a test before arriving in Scotland.Heres when Nicola Sturgeons update will take place today and how to watch...When will Nicola Sturgeon speak today The first minister will give an update on the Covid situation in Scotland today at around :pm.The exact time of the speech will depend on the topical questions running to time.How can I watch Nicola Sturgeons update today The update will be broadcast live on Scottish ParliamentTVand streamed via the Scottish Governments social media pages.It will also be live tweeted on the SNPs Twitter.People can watch on BBC Scotland from :pm.What will Nicola Sturgeon say today The first minister willupdate MSPs on the latest numbers regarding Covid in Scotland, including daily case rates, deaths and hospitalisations.With children aged - being invited for vaccination, she is also likely to put out a fresh call encouraging people to take the vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-update-nicola-sturgeons-announcement-say-today","story":"Nicola Sturgeons weekly Covid updates to Parliament have become the norm in Scotland, offering a public an insight into the governments pandemic plans.This week proved no dferent, with the first minister once again highlighting how the government aims to manage Covid over the coming weeks.Covid cases in Scotland are declining after weeks of sustained high numbers following the relaxation of major restrictions on August .Schools ing soon after this date contributed to a spike in cases, according to the first minister, as well as the general lting of restrictions.Todays update comes just days before the next major measure is introduced in Scotland: vaccine passports in certain settings.Its not the only changing rule incoming - the amber and green travellists are to be abandoned next week, allowing vaccinated travellers from non-red listed countries to enter Scotland without providing evidence of a negative test.Ahead of the release of theNHS Scotland Covid Status App on Thursday and the change in travel rules on Monday,heres what we learned from Nicola Sturgeons Covid update today....

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white

Itrsquos no surprise they arenrsquot queuing up to come back to the country that slung them out.\"Changing immigration rules or relaxing driversrsquo tests is not the way to solve the HGV shortage.

At times, such was the turmoil and ineptitude on display, you would not have left this crew in charge of a rubber duck, never mind a nuclear-powered submarine.Precision was not the point though, this being a piece of fiction. In its favour, Tom Edgersquos drama had a solid gold cast and a strongoccasionally baffling script .Above all, Vigil had pluck and ambition. While this was a tale made for the small screen, the action scenes could have passed muster in a cinema.: No Line of Duty but Jones makes impactWhen we left Amy Silvaat the end of episode it looked as though the jig was up for the DCI.Lamped by a sonar operator who turned out to be an agent for the Russkies, Amy had been stuffed in the same kind of missile casing that had been Martin Compstonrsquos home for the past five weeks. She would have been a goner in the first ten minutessomeone had not walked in on the villain just in time. A lot of that went on in the final hour.Entombed in a tube, all Amy could do was scream for help and think back to the love she had driven away, fellow copper Kirsten , and the daughter who had lost her fatherin a car accident.Eventually, Amy remembered she knew Morse code. As luck would have it, there was someone in the control room who could interpret the messageand with one bound, and a quick vomit, Amy was free to nick the villain.But she had to avoid him killing her first. The chase through the submarine was heart in the mouth stuff, the corridors bathed in red, lights fizzing and flashing.Amy, lithe and muscular, sweating for Scotland in her vest, looked positively Ripleyesque as she hunted the alien presence in her midst.Meanwhile, water was pouring into the boat courtesy of the bad guyrsquos earlier handiwork - he had been a very busy boy - and HMS Vigil was heading for Davy Jonesrsquo locker. The unluckiest submarine in the world looked to be about to meet its fate.But onboard and on shore, the women were not going to let that happen. Though men were predominant, especially at the boss level, it was women who made the key moves, much as in Line of Duty .The men squared off and honour was saved, the anti-Trident MP agreeing to keep quiet ldquothis time. Not before he had a mini rant about getting nukes out of Scotland within his letime, however.It had all been a Russian plot to make the nukes in Scotland seem unsafe and steer MPs into cancelling a replacement deterrent, which sounded a bit rum. Who was to say it would not have had the opposite effect : Was Vigil filmed on a submarine There was no time to worry about any of that because there was hair to be stroked and a relationship to repair. Amy and Kirsten, with their shared love for justice and nice coats, had some talking to do.The last word went to our Martin, which was only fair given he had been stuffed in a tube for a month and a half . As poignant music played he banged on in his last video testament about what a wonderful world it was.The Russkies were back in their box and the planet was safe once more, albeit courtesy of enough explosive power to blow us all to kingdom come. Never mind such details for now, this had been a blast."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stupidity-brexit-truly-coming-home-roost","story":"The most immediate of these is at the pumps, where the shortage of HGV drivers has affected fuel deliveries. The NHS is under-resourced and cannot recruit sufficient skilled staff to cope with existing backlogs, let alone the oncoming challenge of winter illnesses exacerbated by Covid. Supermarket shelves have been showing many signs of shortages affecting a iety of products for months.All of this was predicted by those who gave some thought to the potential effects of Brexit, but their views were dismissed as scaremongering by those with another agenda ndash that of extracting the UK from its ties to the EU because of an outdated and misguided notion of \"sovereignty\". Their ill-considered focus was on exaggerating the extent to which \"foreigners\" were dictating our way of le, as a result of our being part of an extendedtrading bloc. The inevitable compromises that every member country had to accept for the benefit of everyone were painted as egregious violations of our way of le.The anti-Europe faction effectively managed to gull a majority of the electorate into believing that we were less British because of the EU. By extension this implied that Germans were less German, and the French were less French by belonging to the EU. Utter nonsense of course, but it held sway in the end, and we are now suffering the consequences of this disastrous decision.It is an interesting insight into the psychology of group-think in the population that a campaign without a single economic fact to support the rhetoric of prosperity outside the EU could persuade a majority to fall in line and vote to take us out of the EU.Nor, since Brexit, have we seen any benefit to GNP in hard currency from outside the EU nor indeed any sign of the promised queue of countries ready to buy our goods and services. The US, our most prized potential trading partner outside the EU, has just relegated us to the end of the queue. The much-heralded, but essentially trling, trade deals we have managed to establish are insignicant in terms of their contribution to our prosperity.The humiliating reality is that in approaching Brexit, our UK politicians were out of their depth with respect to understanding the realities of the economic world, out of their depth in dealing with the EU, but very well versed in the practices of gulling the electorate into believing that they had their interests at heart. A compliant media, and institutions that are not fit for purpose ensured that the Brexit bandwagon was never properly scrutinised and we are now paying the price for that failure.The question now is: does the UK now have the understanding and the political will get us out of the mess Gerry Seenan, Skelmorlie.* WHY have petrol prices jumped  There is no shortage according to Boris Johnson. In North Ayrshire at the weekend it was .p a litre. Remember Mr Johnson said we were heading for the sunny uplands. Did he just forget to mention that we would be walking George Smith, Clydebank.THE SQUANDERING OF OUR WEALTHGUY Stenhouse is thankful the Scottish Government doesnrsquot have the powers to address the current energy crisis, leaving control with Westminster . Thatrsquos gone well. The Tories sold off our national energy companies to private corporations, sacricing energy security and price stability on the altar of profit for a few. They reduced then eliminated taxes on oil and gas companies, foregoing nearly pound billion in revenues, while Norway collected huge tax revenues which itrsquos using to ensure its people welfare.Then therersquos Brexit. When it left the EU energy market believing it could source cheaper energy outside, the UK made itself vulnerable to external shocks as it is no longer protected by the EUrsquos use of linked auctions to balance energy prices. The House of Lords warning in March that energy prices would rise because post-Brexit cross-border trade is less efficient fell on deaf ears.These are the reasons the UK ranks last out of  western European countries on the proportion of homes able to afford adequate heat.With just . per cent of the UK population, Scotland possesses % of the UKrsquos natural wealth including % of oil, % of gas, % of renewable energy generation and % of hydro power. Only the full powers of independence can prevent the UKrsquos ideologically-driven incompetence and greed from squandering more of our wealth.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.BE BOLD ON TAX INCREASESMAY I throw my  kilos behind the calls from Eric Melvin and Doug Maughanfor an emergency budget by the Scottish Government and an increase of at least one penny on higher rates of income tax Although I can already hear the scrape of penknives sharpening quills by the usual suspects, and claims that there will be a mass desertion of higher rate taxpayers to England, there wont be. Like me, they will know that the much higher costs of living south of the Border and the inconvenience of moving will be far outweighed by the benefits of living in a more civilised society in Scotland.Its time for the Scottish Government to be bold. Lets hope they take the opportunity of demonstrating our higher moral standards and get on with it.John Jamieson, Ayr.RAYNER MUST THINK AGAINANGELA Rayner has unwittingly offered a hostage to fortune with her use of the word \"scum\" to describe members of the governing party . She will have to carry that albatross around her neck for some time to come whenever she faces public grillings in the media.Had she made such a comment in the House of Commons, the Speaker would have demanded that she withdraw such an unparliamentary remark. Where the headlines should have concentrated on the meat of her message, that has been eclipsed by the screaming of the word \"scum\" in the ious bulletins. Not only that, but all her colleagues will now be pestered in interviews about their thoughts on her reckless comment.Ms Rayner is undoubtedly a strong and vibrant campaigner for her party with plenty of support behind her, but she may well have seriously dented her prospects of becoming an electable future Labour leader through this careless comment.Any politician worth their salt must acknowledge that political opponents have their principles, eventhey are diametrically contrary to the principles espoused by that politicians party.Clearly what she uttered at that fringe meeting would have been warmly welcomed by the zealots who cannot separate the persons ndash who deserve the dignity of human respect ndash from the policies they advocate, which emphasise the importance of the inidual to the exclusion of the communitarian spirit.She must rise above the pettiness and the hatred embodied in that remarkshe wants her party to regain its place as an electable force worthy of being the governing group in the UK.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.TIME TO TRUST THE TEACHERSCLEARLY the campaign against making le a little easier for trans people is going to rumble on . It will do until Scotland joins those nations which have reformed the process of legal recognition of a persons true sex.We saw exactly the same fear tactics used by those who opposed making the lives of youngLGBTI+ people more tolerable when the then Scottish Executive moved to abolish Section , the law banning the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools as a \"pretended family relationship\". People are naturally concerned when extreme fears are stirred up by those opposed to LGBTI+ human rights. With Section  the supposed fear was that teachers would expose tiny tots to sexually explicit material. Guess what: the fears that were stirred up proved baseless.Now we have a scare that teachers will be suedthey get something wrong in the classroom or do not promote some radical agenda. We should be reassured that our teachers will behave professionally after the reform of the Gender Recognition Act just as they did after the repeal of Section . Those opposed to the rights and welfare of LGBTI+ young people will always try to stir up unfounded fears but let us hope that Scotland as a whole will prove to be more progressive and that the wellbeing of all pupils will be supported.Brian Dempsey, Lecurer in Law, University of Dundee.Read more: This harsh brand of Conservatism is the real threat to the Union"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-grateful-peacemaking-couple-earned-place-history","story":"The late John Hume was one of the few politicians I met at Westminster whom I could count as a lasting friend. I also had the privilege of sharing time with him and Pat on numerous occasions after his retirement, when he suffered from dementia. For several years, Pat was his devoted carer and anyone who has cared for a loved one in that condition will appreciate the dedication, patience and commitment which that entails.My happiest memory of Pat and John was May , , when the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people of Ireland in a referendum. I had dinner that evening in the company of Pat and John, who introduced me to Bishop Edward Daly. That evoked terrible memories of the same priest, the younger Father Daly who, in the face of lethal gunfire, was pictured waving a blood-stained handkerchief while courageously trying to administer the last rites to one of the victims of the Bloody Sunday massacre in . That iconic image, which was seen by millions of people throughout the world, became an international symbol of the suffering of the people of Ireland.More than a quarter of a century later, on that memorable May evening, there was a hope that Ireland at last was on the cusp of a new era, where the people of Ireland would live together in peace and harmony, whatever their religion or politics. There is still a long way to go but people like Pat and John Hume paved the way. They certainly have earned their place in history. ldquo Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.Dennis Canavan, Bannockburn.NOTHING HOLY ABOUT AGONYWHILE Lord Wallace, current Moderator of the General Assemblyand Michael Veitch of Christian Action Research and Education, Scotlandcertainly reflect the official stance of their respective faiths, their views are not those held by the majority of church members nor churchgoers.In all the polls on this issue, the majority of people with a faith consistently want a change in the law. Many senior religious figures also support assisted dying, including George Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury Rabbi Jonathan Romain the Rev Richard Holloway, a former Bishop of Edinburgh, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.By coincidence, at the weekend I received an email from an old pal from my Edinburgh University days in the s, askingI was the same Sheila Duffy he knew  years ago and whom hersquod read about in the Canadian Medical Digest as a supporter of assisted suicide.Alexander HG Paterson, who was a medical student when I knew him, is now a leading oncologist in Alberta.

They even put up with a terrible risk when the nuclear reactor is switched on ndash they are given iodine tablets as a precaution. Why do they put up with it and why do we allow our beautul country to be a battleground of the future Susan Martin, Glasgow.ONE IS NOT AMUSEDBBC One Scotland has dropped the Tuesday edition of The One Show from its current schedules, replacing it with a repeat of River City.

Situated just outside Irvine, the hotelrsquos , square metre Si! Spa has recently reopened following a pound million makeover.We arrived on a rainy Sunday and headed straight for the thermal suite, a stylish relaxation area that includes a sauna, steam room, rainforest shower, and vitality pool. With atmospheric lighting and my phone locked away in the changing room, I was so relaxed that I nearly missed my scheduled spa treatment ndasha massage and facial that used luxury Espa and Ishga products.Suffering from the kind of upper backache that most of the home-working kitchen table workforce will sympathise with, I hoped that a deep tissue massage would leave me feeling refreshed. That was exactly what I got, with the combination of hot stones and firm pressure banishing my backache after just half an hour. Then came a facial and therapeutic scalp ritual which left me with delightfully glowing skin.From there, we headed outside to the hotelrsquos open-air spa experience, with custom-built decking offering views over the golf course and a collection of sun loungers in case the sun made an unexpected appearance.We were delighted to have the sunken outdoor hot tub to ourselves, enjoying that sensation of feeling smug and warm within the water despite the weather being decidedly chilly. Thinking the spa experience was over we started to head back inside, but the lovely staff brought out a sorbet and a fresh fruit smoothie which we enjoyed under the glow of the in-built heaters.We then headed back to our room ndash a conveniently short walk from both the spa and restaurant ndash where we changed for dinner in the hotelrsquos Coast restaurant. Fortunately, we opted for loose-fitting options as the portions were some of the most generous I have ever been served. A starter of salt and chilli-battered chicken included six huge pieces of chicken breast, while the prawn cocktail had two dozen prawns and plenty of bread. No scrimping on portions here.For our mains we opted for a butter chicken curry , and a buttermilk chicken burger . Both were delicious.Our waiter, Frazer, was incredibly friendly and reassuringly attentive when it came to my nut allergy, which I had flagged up when we booked the trip. He had checked with the kitchen that every ingredient I was being served was nut-free, meaning I could relax into my food coma without any allergy concerns.And despite the big portions, I manged to valiantly order a dessert of Baked Alaska, made with Isle of Arran white chocolate ice cream. It was every bit as indulgent as I hoped for.Breakfast the next morning was one of the best wersquove ever tasted: creamy scrambled egg, vegetarian sausages, potato scones, beans, tomatoes and freshly-squeezed orange juice. We left feeling refreshed, recharged, and wondering how soon we could justiably book another spa break.Supporting around  local jobs, SimpsInns has invested over pound.m across its portfolio of venues around the Ayrshire coast to enhance the quality and overall visitor experience.

They can appear fragile, vulnerable even, on the edge and cut off from the mainland. But those same circumstances can also foster resilience, community strength and self-sufficiency. In past centuries, island living was often thought to be behind the times compared to the mainland ndash but now the tables have turned and many island communities are leading the way in sustainability.Living in a city, food appears in the shops and rubbish and recycling material magically disappear with the council lorries ndash itrsquos all very convenient. However this makes it easier to ignore all the players in the supply chains that bring goods to us, as well as the environmental impact of what we discard. Not so on islands.When everything you buy arrives by ferry and rubbish has to leave the same wayit is perhaps not surprising that island communities are forging new, more environmentally friendly paths ndash with active sharing economies, clean energy and inspirational community initiatives.For many Scottish islands a turning point has been community ownership. Across the country it has been shown communities able to take responsibility for managing their own assets make decisions that benefit and protect the land they steward. Islands Secretary Mairi Gougeon is keen to build on the sustainability successes of island communities in Scotlandrsquos journey to net zero.In a recent release she stated that: ldquoWe know that our islands are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change but also have huge potential and natural capital that will help us meet our net zero ambition.ldquoIsland communities are already engaged and acting to cut emissions and our commitment to make at least three of our islands carbon neutral by  will seek to build on work already underway.ldquoSupporting islands to become carbon neutral will help protect their unique heritage, culture and bioersity, while also delivering on our commitment to support island communities to flourish economically and socially.ISLE OF EIGGThe Isle of Eigg led the way in community ownership and is now often visited by researchers from around the world aiming to learn from the successes of this independent island community.The islanders bought their island in  for pound. million from the eccentric German artist Professor Murama.Ten thousand members of the general public contributed to the buyout fund, which successfully placed the ownership of the island in the hands of The Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust ndash a partnership between the residents of Eigg, The Highland Council and the Scottish Wildle Trust.In  Eigg launched an off-grid electricity system powered by wind, water and solar ndash a world first.The systems included four wind turbines, a hydro scheme on the Laig river and solar , replacing the noisy, polluting diesel generators that households previously relied on. Eigg Electric is community-owned, managed and maintained.Eigg is also supported by conservation volunteers and, despite missing them this year, , trees were planted in early .Eigg today is a dynamic and successful island. The population continues to rise, with many young people raised on the island choosing toto start businesses and bring up families. There is an impressive creative lsquocan-dorsquo spirit.Undaunted by their small size or location the island hosts music festivals, artist residencies and therersquos even a record company ndash Lost Map Records ndash run by Johnny Lynch ndash aka Pictish Trail.Eigg will soon be home to Scotlandrsquos first co-operative brewery, after The Isle of Eigg Brewery raised pound, through a membership scheme.Once operational % of the profits will also be dedicated to local small businesses start-ups and community initiatives.For Eigg, community ownership has allowed the residents to shape the way they want to look after this beautul island- theyrsquove built homes through a community construction firm, brought in speedy WiFi improving job prospects, banned visitor cars and welcomed new families to the island.ISLE OF GIGHATHE Isle of Gigha, off the west coast of Kintyre, was successfully bought by the community and handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Truston March ,  ndash and just as on Eigg the handover anniversary is now a day of celebration.The Scottish Land Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise helped raise the pound million required. Despite some financially bumpy patches over the past  years, the island is now thriving with a growing population.IGHT oversees both Gigha Green Power and Gigha Renewable Energy, which both operate wind turbines on the island.A Gigha Community Fund invests income from the renewable energy back into the community ndash funding initiatives to improve health, develop skills, relieve poverty and conserve the environment.ISLE OF RUMNeighbouring island to Eigg, Rum has been partially owned by the community since . Previously Scottish Natural Heritagewas responsible for the entire island, which meant most stable jobs were tied to the work of the organisation.Residents and the SNH agreed giving the community independence would lead to a more stable population on the island, with capacity for growth.All  adults voted in favour of the transfer, and the Isle of Rum Community Trusttook ownership of the village of Kinloch, including all of the homes, farm buildings and surrounding land.The IRCT aims to manage the community land for the benefit of the community, while protecting the natural environment of this wildle-rich island. Four new IRCT homes have now been built and others refurbished, giving this island a more sustainable future.ISLE OF ULVAUlva, off the west coast of Mull, is the newest island to achieve community ownership, completing the transfer in June . The North West Mull Community Woodland Company now owns the island, a purchase helped by a grant from the Scottish Land Fund worth pound. million and following the approval of a Community Right to Buy application.The immediate aims for Ulva are repopulation and improving the services on the island for residents and visitors. Much of the existing housing stock was extremely dilapidated now six properties are currently being renovated as well as the pier. Green energy is part of the plan too ndash Ulva is collaborating with other small islands across Europe to bid for funding to undertake a clean energy transition, and is working with an energy consultant to identy appropriate strategies for the island.Two new electric vehicles are now in operation too. At the time of the buy out the population was only five people. However an appeal for new residents in  prompted hundreds of people to apply to move to the island.A couple from Edinburgh moved to re-open the islandrsquos Boathouse cafeacute last spring, and many more potential islanders are ready to join them in future. In the s Ulva was home to more than  people and, while a much slower population growth is planned now, itrsquos clear the future is brighter than ever on Ulva."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-launches-new-improved-online-puzzles","story":"Whether you want to play on your device or with a printable version, The Herald has introduced new games To our fantastic puzzles section, including Jigsaw, Number Jig, Quick Crossword and more.Herald subscribers have exclusive access to our puzzles section, and we add more than  every week.As a subscriber, youll have access to The Heraldrsquos fun and challenging puzzle section, updated every day with quizzes, crosswords, puzzles and much more.

She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SHIEL-FOR-THE-CUP-3-1.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald crofts have become the the bitcoin of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYes, it’s more of a hobby than a full-time commitment, but it’s ‘in the blood’.. But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

We now want to capture the experiences of all local dog owners so we can build a picture of dog ownership today and what more Dogs Trust can do to help them and their dogs.“This will be the most comprehensive census of dogs and dog lovers ever completed and we would love iteveryone who is passionate about dogs could do their bit to help our four-legged friends of the future have the best lives possible.“What people tell us today will help us make sure we are able to do everything we can to support dogs and their owners for the next  years and more.”For more information and to take part in the National Dog Survey, visit www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk Dog owners who complete the survey will get tailored behaviour advice sent direct to them.

He said later that the problems were quickly resolved. In total there were , applications, with , of those completed on Monday. The system was designed to cope with , an hour.Mr Lyons urged people to be patient as they had four weeks to apply and a minimum of four weeks to spend the money.“We put additional safeguarding measures in place so that whenever you went online and put in your email address, that the email would not be sent out to you until there was space and capacity within the system because the last thing that we wanted was to see the system overwhelmed,” he said.“So, although some people had a bit of a wait to get onto the website and a bit of a wait for the email itself, the website was always running, it was always open and it is working. I know there was signicant demand earlier, the issues have been resolved and the applications are now progressing through our system.”A spokesperson for the department said that they are working hard to fix the technical issues on the website.“We always knew demand for the Spend Local card would be extremely high, which is why we are giving people four weeks to apply,” they said.“Please be patient there is plenty of time for everyone to apply, receive and use their Spend Local card.”Mr Lyons advised that “not everybody has to rush at once” to apply and that the verication messages were being sent “in a staged process just to make sure the website isn’t overwhelmed all at once”.“There is a card available for everyone that is eligible, so I would encourage people to apply for that over the coming weeks,” he told the BBC.The Belfast ’s Facebook page was inundated with comments about people experiencing dficulties operating the online system.One person said that the website had crashed as early as .am and that they had tried three times to apply and received no email response.“Another example of exemplary NI Civil Service standards in how NOT to roll out a computer system,” said one disappointed user.“Waste of time. I’ve clicked on the link attached twice, still no email sent. Good start,” said another.One of our readers said that they waited three and a half hours to receive an email and still received no response. “I then tried the NI Direct website, but it just crashed again. If we treated our customers like this, we would have no business,” they said.There were, however, a few lucky ones who managed to submit their application relatively pain-free.One said they “got it easy enough, only took a few minutes”. Emily Townsley said that at the very start, she submitted her email and  minutes later received a link but experienced a slight dficulty before finally submitting an application.“I tried to click on it and went very slow but half an hour later it went through to the application, once I filled it all out I clicked finish and it came up failed API call so I left it until pm and got another email sent to me and clicked it on and only took one minute and went through.”From successful application submission, it is anticipated that you will receive your voucher within seven to  days.The deadline for applications is October  and the cut-off for spending the card is November .A phone line is due to open in two weeks’ time, on Monday October , for those having dficulty using the online system.Iniduals can also apply on behalf of up to three people. It is open to anyone over the age of  living in Northern Ireland.Read MoreNI High Street voucher scam warningRelated topicsDepartment for the EconomyGordon LyonsSinn FéinMore On Department for the Economy PremiumYoung people ‘not equipped’ to succeed in the workplace PremiumLess than a third of Covid support grants wrongly handed out by Stormont department edNI High Street voucher scam warningEconomy Minister Gordon Lyons urged to extend Covid payment to all NI students in GB and IrelandLabour market in great shape but economist warns ‘headwinds intensying’Most ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursSecurity concerns raised over Easyjet flight to Belfast with passengers kept on plane for two hoursSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsWatch: Attempted theft of moped in BelfastArrest after Belfast Andersonstown Road serious crashTop VideosPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSwann calls for vaccine passports to be ‘on the books’ as four deaths and , cases reportedRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsDemand for late bookings soars as travel rules to easeLatestThomas Tuchel insists he is in no place to make vaccination recommendationsCalls for Inner City Helping Homeless to be dissolved ‘as quickly as possible’Taoiseach: .% corporate tax rate ‘not Ireland’s unique selling point’Sadiq Khan needs   protection ‘due to colour of his skin and god he worships’Jamie Carragher says Roger Hunt helped make Liverpool the club they are today,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

According to its initial analysis, almost % of the children identied as close contacts did not go on to develop Covid- as a result.The figures have been released by the PHA as concerns remain over a decision to change the definition of a close contact in schools across Northern Ireland.On September , Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer sent a letter to parents, pupils and schools in which he said he was “confident that now is the right time to introduce a more targeted approach to the identication of close contacts of Covid cases in schools”.Professor Sir Michael McBride said he had made the decision “having examined the evidence” and referred to studies carried out in Scotland and England.He continued: “The PHA has analysed data on over , students from our own schools who were asked to isolate because they were close contacts in school and the findings are very similar to those in Scotland.“These findings from across the UK are consistent and support the move to a more targeted approach to the identication of close contacts as the correct and proportionate approach at this stage in the pandemic.”In response to a request for further information, a PHA spokesman last night said: “Between March , , and June , , there were over , occasions where a school child was identied as a close contact of a case in school and asked to self-isolate.“This period included time when the Delta iant was in circulation in Northern Ireland.“Initial PHA analysis indicates that in almost % of cases, the child who was identied as a contact did not go on to develop Covid- as a result.“It is important to note that this data is still being quality assured as appropriate for a peer-reviewed publication, and part of the collection process from schools was manual and therefore further work is being undertaken to help ensure that all contacts have been recorded.“However, these initial findings reflect a similar experience in England and Scotland.“Further information will be published in due course when the process of data analysis and quality assurance has been completed.”Alliance Party MLA Chris Lyttle, a member of the Stormont education committee, called for more up-to-date research to be carried out and made public as soon as possible.“This new definition of a close contact in school and contact tracing was brought in very quickly,” he said.“It needs to be explained properly to parents and backed up with the most current data possible in order to provide reassurance to parents and staff that it is safe.“We have asked for figures relating to the number of close contacts who go on to develop Covid- and particularly after the day two and day eight PCR tests but we have been told it will be a few weeks before that will be available.”Under the new policy, the number of students considered close contacts, and therefore required to self-isolate and undergo testing, has decreased signicantly.It has led to concerns that children may be unwittingly infecting vulnerable family members with the virus and some schools are now voluntarily informing parents when a child tests positive to allow parents to decide what precautions they want to take.Related topicsDepartment

Credit: Liam McBurney PADavid YoungSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Executive has decided to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and some other indoor settings in Northern Ireland. At a meeting on Monday night, ministers decided to remove the one-metre distance requirement for the retail sector, indoor attractions and seated indoor venues.However, ministers were split on vaccine certication and over guidance to business and venue owners to mitigate the impact of allowing ato full capacity.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused the DUP and Sinn Fein of making an “astounding and reckless” decision to oppose moves to introduce certication in light of winter pressures on health services. First Minister Paul Givan tweeted: “Progress made after a constructive meeting of the Executive to remove social distancing requirements for indoor seated venues, indoor visitor attractions and retail settings.“Guidance will be provided for measures that can be taken to mitigate risk.”The measures are to take effect from pm on Thursday. Further consideration is to be given to the hospitality sector on October .The Executive said that despite the social distancing requirement being removed, “we would ask people to keep close face to face contact to a minimum at all times”.An Executive statement said: “The Executive has today considered the existing regulations and has agreed to remove the legal requirement to socially distance in retail and indoor visitor attractions.“We ask that those responsible for these venues, and those attending them, continue to utilise all other available mitigations such as hand sanitising, good ventilation, and using one way systems where possible. The wearing of a face covering remains a legal requirement in these settings.“The Executive has also decided to remove the requirement to socially distance in indoor seated venues such as theatres, concert halls and cinemas.”The advice includes the installation of screening, one-way systems and increased ventilation. Ministers will issue additional guidance to indoor seated venues advising that they introduce entry policies that require proof of either Covid- vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or evidence of a positive PCR test within the previous six months.However, ministers were split on this. The SDLP’s Nichola Mallon opposed the move to only advise that indoor seated venues ask for Covid certication or negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the last six months.Ms Mallon proposed that the steps be mandatory. She also wanted the measure beefed up to mean patrons had to show vaccine certication and a negative lateral flow test or proof of infection in the last six months.Alliance Justice Minister Naomi Long supported this but the other ministers, including Health Minister Robin Swann, voted against it.When it came to the vote on the original proposal to make the recommendations in guidance only, Ms Mallon voted against and Ms Long abstained. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood said: “It is astounding and reckless that DUP and Sinn Féin Ministers have kicked the can down the road instead of bringing certainty and clarity.“Their decision not to put vaccine certications in regulation but instead to remove social distancing requirements and advise businesses to opt in is totally irresponsible. Not only does this offer no incentive for vaccination, it puts the onus entirely on businesses themselves. This is a cop out and another failure of leadership.”Ministers will not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector until next week. Four further deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid- were reported here on Monday, along with  new confirmed cases.Related topicsSDLPSinn FéinColum EastwoodNichola MallonPaul GivanAlliance PartyNaomi LongRobin SwannMore On SDLP PremiumViewpointOpinionPacts feed into the democratic deficitCoveney set to be sent to Northern Ireland centenary church service in Armagh PremiumDUP at : Started off as a protest party before becoming part of the political establishment, but is it now turning full circle Derry GP handed -month suspension over Covid misinformation PremiumSDLP delays annual conference as Covid rates remain highMost ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursSecurity concerns raised over Easyjet flight to Belfast with passengers kept on plane for two hoursSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsWatch: Attempted theft of moped in BelfastArrest after Belfast Andersonstown Road serious crashTop VideosPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSwann calls for vaccine passports to be ‘on the books’ as four deaths and , cases reportedRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchDemand for late bookings soars as travel rules to easeExecutive considers ending social distancing at outdoor venues with mitigations in placeLatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageTwo-week grace period to apply to Scotland’s vaccine passport scheme – SturgeonScott McTominay s to Scotland squad for World Cup qualiersMorrisons workers win key legal battle in equal pay fightHarry Maguire could be out injured for a few weeks, says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Margaret McLaughlinAllan PrestonTwitterEmailSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFans of Barry’s amusements in Portrush experienced a rollercoaster of emotions on Monday after it emerged it could reopen “for one last hurrah” as an entertainment venue.It’s understood the new owners — property developer Michael Herbert — is seeking a tenant from the entertainment or leisure sector to operate the beloved attraction.Read MoreBarry’s Portrush: Could big dipper run again as owner hunts for leisure operator It remains unclear what this means for the long-term future of the property formerly owned by the Trufelli family and residents have previously voiced concerns it will be demolished some day to make way for housing or apartments.Aaron Chambers from Trogg#s Surf Shop on Main Street said he would welcome any extra footfall a new tenant could bring to the town.“If Barry’s does open again I’m sure it will bring a few more people into town. But I think the key thing to look at in Portrush is what is there for kids,” he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I have two daughters, aged six and eight, what can I realistically do with them in Portrush “I can take them to Sportsland the amusements, Phil’s the amusements. Kiddieland is open as well but that’s it.“There’s a football pitch but half the time you get shouted at for being on it. I’m a massive skateboarder and am part of trying to get a skate park in Portrush. So it baffles me, at one time I counted around  establishments you could buy alcohol from in town so there’s a massive imbalance.”Addressing the new owners of Barry’s, he added: “I think there’s so much they could dothey take into account the three main sports in Portrush golf, surfing and skateboarding.“I might be a little bit biased, but it’s a seaside town. We need to cater for the locals first of all but also for the footfall coming in as well.”Joe Killen is the owner of the Dolphin Takeaway on Causeway Street.Of course it would make a dference. The loss of Barry#s to Portrush has been tremendous as far as trade is concerned,” he said. That#s why families come to Portrush more than anything especially given the weather that we have sometimes.Obviously I don#t expect there would be any change this year butthey did find someone to take it on, even for a short period of time...I assume they#re trying to do this as a short term thing before they get planning permission. CertainlyBarry#s opened up again it would be a help to most businesses in the town.”He said his business had managed “better than expected” this summer, but it remained a big loss to not have the seaside town’s most famous attraction.Sending his own message to the new owners, Mr Killen said: I would imagine that Barry#s was quite a profitable business. I can#t see anyone in the town who would be against having it back.We always like to say that families come to Portrush to go to Barry#s and to go to The Dolphin for their fish supper.George Nelson owns Babushka Kitchen Cafe on Portrush#s South Pier.My expectation is that would be a short term exercise to offset the costs while they develop the rest of it, he said.They#re probably getting plans drawn up which will take a lot of time. Any members of the public I talk to tell me what a great loss Barry#s is.The stance I would take is that it#s really sad for the generations who won#t get to take their kids and grandkids.You certainly do notice a dferent dynamic in the town with it not being open. But what I would say is that it#s not been open for two years at this point.When Portrush has been busy during that time it#s been every bit as busy. I think Barry#s was a great asset to the town but at the same time the town will continue to thrive without it. I think the seaside, the location, the scenery and there#s lots of other independent businesses there.People genuinely want a bit of iety and drives tourism too. That said, I would welcome Barry#s coming back evenit was for just one last visit.“Being able to bring someone down for one last hurrah could be really valuable and could be good for people. Certainly as a short term thing it will attract people into the town evenit is just for a couple of years.”With no long-term guarantee of what the new owners intend for the site, George said building up resilience for tourism in other ways was vital.I’ve talked about it to a few other businesses in town recently. We’re all saying that we’re seeing the same volumes of people.In a way they now also have more disposable income to spend on whatever  they’re doing. I don’t mean that in a negative way, Barry’s was definitely an asset but Portrush is still continuing to thrive.” .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursSecurity concerns raised over Easyjet flight to Belfast with passengers kept on plane for two hoursSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsWatch: Attempted theft of moped in BelfastArrest after Belfast Andersonstown Road serious crashTop VideosPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageEnd of social distancing in some indoor settings: what you need to knowAlmost , official complaints made to NI health trusts during -Swann wants vaccine certication scheme ‘as soon as necessary’Revealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchLatestThomas Tuchel insists he is in no place to make vaccination recommendationsCalls for Inner City Helping Homeless to be dissolved ‘as quickly as possible’Taoiseach: .% corporate tax rate ‘not Ireland’s unique selling point’Sadiq Khan needs   protection ‘due to colour of his skin and god he worships’Jamie Carragher says Roger Hunt helped make Liverpool the club they are today,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

Philip McKinney, an Alliance councillor on Derry City and Strabane District Council, said government intervention was needed quicklywe are not to have permanent empty shelves. He said: We need action, not just words. Im an Alliance councillor, but Im saying this as a truck driver of  years experience. googletag.cmd.push “I dont have all the answers. We need government intervention - and quickly -we are not to have empty shelves permanently.” He said there were four main reasons for a shortage of drivers. “Brexit: a lot of our drivers from countries like Romania went back to the EU. “Training - If youre , you can apply for a LGV+C provisional licence. But to get a full LGV C+E licence, can cost between pound, and pound,. What young person has that sort of money available  But many training companies try to help with payment plans.  “There are very few government incentives for young people. But there are ways to bring people into the industry without fees.  Truck driver, Alliiance Councillor Philip McKinney.  “At the English depot of one Northern Ireland hauler, an apprenticeship scheme was introduced - run in conjunction with a training company with government grants. And successful apprentices walked straight into full-time jobs. “As well as being responsible for a pound, truck and high value cargo, a driver needs to know the traffic laws of the country theyre driving in, EU driver hour regulations, road transport regulations, hazardous goods legislation and licences, working time directive health and safety regulations and the driver Certicate of Professional Competence.” Cllr McKinney said wages were obviously important. He added: “The average is around pound per hour, unless you have specialist freight.     The hauliers arent totally to blame for this because in the past the client dictated the haulage rate and to a small haulier every penny counted. It was sink or swim. If we want to keep goods moving, haulage and drivers rates are going to rise  - unfortunately for the consumer.” Describing infrastructure in this part of the world as abysmal, Councillor McKinney added: “Its an embarrassment that we still dont have a motorway dual carriageway between Belfast and the North West. “For example,  I have to take a load from Birmingham to Gweedore Industrial Estate in Donegal, I join the M motorway to Scotland. I take my breaks in motorway services with proper facilities. I get the ferry from Cairnryan to Belfast and continue to Gweedore. “I have to have a full daily rest of minimum nine hours.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

ONEILLS DERRY SFC ROUND  Slaughtneil -Swatragh - The -point winning margin saw Paul Bradleys side finish in second spot behind Lavey, with the Davitts dropping to third on score dference.With ongoing maintenance on their main pitch at Davitt Park, Swatragh have been playing on their training pitch and while it was in pristine condition, its tight confines made it dficult to find space.Swatragh were more aggressive on their press and limited Antoacutein McMullan to just one short kick-out and a  percent first-half retention rate. A possession won by Fionnbharr McGuigan was the only break won with the rest coming from frees awarded for pushes in a congested middle third.At the other end, Sean McNicholl had marginally more freedom and kicked excellently throughout, losing just two kick-outs over the hour.Kevin Madden handed Michael Friel a first start of the championship and stationed him at corner forward, where he was picked up by Brendan Rogers. Karl McKaigue went across to Francis Kearney, with Peadar Kearney on Fintan McGurk.Oisin McWilliams wore number , but started at midfield where Chrissy McKaigue lined up against him. In the reshuffle, Cahal Murray started at centre forward where he pulled to the wings and the centre of Slaughtneils defence was manned by the rotation of Patsy Bradley and Padraig Cassidy.It left Slaughtneil needing a high concentration level to balance a compact centre with Cassidy getting forward to punch holes in Swatraghs defence. Brendan Rogers also had a major impact on the game and got forward at every opportunity.At the other end, Sean Francis Quinn picked up Christopher Bradley, who played slightly ahead of Shane McGuigan and Brian Cassidy. Sean Tad Cassidy and Seaacuten Oacute Caiside were alternating on Slaughtneils right wing against James Kearney and Niall Coyle. Oacute Caiside was later forced off with a suspected torn cruciate ligament injury.On the other wing, Keelan Feeney got on enough ball to keep Sean Martin Quinn out of the game. His case wasnt helped by not having a gumshield and Barry Cassidy let him re-enter the fray with one in situ.Feeney and McGrath combined on the left wing for Shane McGuigan to get a run on Diarmuid Dillon and fist over the first score of the game and the Emmets doubled their lead with a confident Sammy Bradley point at the end of a Rogers foray upfield.Midway through the first-half, a McMullan kick-out was punched back into the Slaughtneil defence where Chrissy McKaigue saw black for taking down the galloping Oisin McWilliams.Three minutes later a Diarmuid Dillon body check on Brian Cassidy also saw him in the sin-bin and it opened the game up.A close-range Meehaul McGrath goal after the water break put Slaughtneil - to - ahead. After Rogers and Padraig Cassidy ran at the Swatragh defence, McGrath was calm enough to sidestep in a crowded penalty area before slotting to the net.Slaughtneils game of closing down the midfield involved players dropping off to the closest man, but when Sean Cassidy lost his footing Sean Francis Quinn came forward to kick a point with the outside of his right boot.Peadar Kearney, who escaped an earlier yellow card, was walking a fine line after another foul on Fintan McGurk who was Swatraghs most potent forward. James Kearney missed the free, but when Conor McAtamney won the next kick-out, McGurk went through to make it a three-point game, - to -.The Swa then had a goal chance, started by Francis Kearney and involving McGurk, that saw Kearneys low shot blocked by the feet of Rogers. Oisin McWilliams and Francis Kearneyalso missed chances to eat into the lead before half-time.Friel started the second-half at centre-forward and after an early Christopher Bradley wide, Francis Kearney hit Swatraghs only point of the second-half from a free.Seven minutes into the half, a well-worked move involving Rogers, McGrath and Sammy Bradley saw Shane McGuigan in on goal, where he was fouled and referee Cassidy awarded a penalty. Sean McNicholl saved McGuigans first attempt, but only into the Slaughtneil man path and he finished the rebound to the net.McNicholl worked the kick-out short and an Oisin McWilliams run up the right flank pulled Slaughtneil out of position and when the ball was squared, Cahal Murray palmed to the net at the far post, making the score - to - in the visitors favour after  minutes.Swatragh had a spell with the McWilliams twins inside, but Murrays goal was their last score of the game. With limited space, the diagonal ball wasnt an option and anytime it was played in straight, Rogers was able to come from behind to turnover the ball.McMullan was able to poke some of his kick-outs to Feeney and slowly but surely Slaughtneil got a firm grip on the game. Rogers got forward to kick a point, followed by a Christopher Bradley point after Seacute and Shane McGuigan linked up on the left wing.When Francis Kearney kicked the ball over the sideline, and with Swatraghs defence open, Cormac ODohertys cross field ball found the run of Shane McGuigan who thumped the ball high, confidently and straight between the posts for a - to - lead to rubber-stamp Slaughtneils rampant third quarter.With the eight point winning margin in sight and with the game firmly in their clutches, Slaughtneil hit five unanswered points in the final  minutes on their way to a commanding win. googletag.cmd.push SLAUGHTNEIL: Antoacutein McMullan Peadar Kearney, Karl McKaigue, Brendan RogersSeaacuten Oacute Caiside, Padraig Cassidy, Keelan Feeney Patsy Bradley, Chrissy McKaigue Sean Cassidy, Cormac ODoherty, Meehaul McGrathChristopher BradleyShane McGuigan , Brian CassidySUBS: Fionnbharr McGuigan for S Oacute Caiside , Seacute McGuiganfor B Cassidy , Francis McEldowney for P Kearney , Ronan Bradley for M McGrath BLACK CARD: C McKaigue YELLOW CARD: P Bradley  SWATRAGH: Sean McNicholl Aaron McGuckin, Diarmuid Dillon Sean Francis QuinnBrian Diamond, Tiarnaacuten Walsh, Niall Coyle Conor McAtamney, Oisin McWilliams Sean Martin Quinn, Cahal Murray , James KearneyMichael Friel, Francis Kearney , Fintan McGurk SUBS: Lorcan McWilliams for J Kearney , Patrick Turner for B Diamond , Liam Kearney for N Coyle , Niall McAtamney for C Murray BLACK CARD: D Dillon YELLOW CARDS: M Friel , O McWilliams  REF: Barry Cassidy     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Sept   addthis, The Churches Trust celebrated four years of their flagship youth project ‘Community of Homes’ this week with the launch of a very colourful ‘Creativity and Wellbeing’ book. The book depics the wonderful work of the young people involved and showing how creative pathways contributed to personal development in what has been trying times over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push Held at St. Columb’s Park House, the Mayor, Graham Warke, representatives from Department for Communities, Derry and Strabane District Council, local community groups and schools who took part, all listened intently as Churches Trust CEO, Fiona Fagan praised the young people who took part in the project and described the four year journey as ‘one that has been enriching for all involved.’ ‘This successful programme of creativity and well-being is a celebration of four years hard work by these young people especially through the dficult Covid period. It is also testament to their resilience as we, hopefully, come out of the pandemic and see brighter days ahead,’ commented Ms. Fagan. The project was funded by Department for Communities within their ‘Uniting Communities’ programme which funds projects that promote good relations and reconciliation through sports and creativity by addressing barriers to community participation. Churches Trust worked in collaboration with The Art Smyth, Ardnashee School and College, St. Joseph’s Boys School, and Lisneal and St. Mary’s Colleges. The celebratory event was funded by the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council through the Community Relations and Cultural Diversity grants programme. Fiona also thanked core funders Community Relations Council, Derry City and Strabane District Council, and Inner City Trust. Speaking after last week’s event, Kathryn Hill, Director of Active Communities in the Department for Communities commented:     “I was delighted to have been invited along today to join in celebrating the launch of the Churches Trust’s Community of Homes, Creativity and Wellbeing book. “The Department has funded the Community of Homes project in recent years though our Together: Building a United Community Uniting Opportunities grant scheme, a good relations programme delivered through the medium of sport, physical and creative activity. “This project has engaged young people in a unique range of creative activities that brings communities together, addresses barriers to participation and increases social skills. “I want to thank Fiona and the Churches Trust for successfully delivering this project and most importantly the young people that have taken part.” Showcase Wednesday’s book launch also included the showcasing of seven youth projects involving over  young people each year from local schools, churches and communities. Many of the youth project are structured using the creative pathways: all projects are underpinned by good relations, personal development and skills development. Projects range from ongoing one-to-one mentoring programmes, to summer camps, to small groups working on themed ad hoc projects and to larger groups who engage in three-six month programmes. Speakers at the event included the Mayor, Graham Warke Kathryn Hill, Department for Communities, artist Sinead Smyth, Faustina Starrett, North West Regional College, and the Churches Trust’s own Catherine Coyle who delivered an address on the success of the four year programme.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council were last night meeting to discuss the future of Portstewart Town Hall after an audit earlier this year raised questions over its ownership. googletag.cmd.push In April, the Council reported that the NI Audit Office was unable to raty its   accounts, citing ownership issues over three buildings in the Borough. “In recent days, we have been made aware that Councils financial statements include signicant buildings that the Council has no proof and title to,” said an Audit Office statement read at a meeting. Council agreed at a Land and Property Services Committee meeting in February to hand the building back to its historic landowners the Montagu Estate, and had taken legal advice on the issue. A special meeting due to take place tonight will see the public excluded from viewing proceedings, with a decision taken to hold the meeting privately in committee. The decision has disappointed local residents group Portstewart Community Association, who have launched an online petition to persuade the Council to pause all legal action. “We have been challenging the decision taken by councillors to hand Portstewart Town Hall back to the Montague Estate, who have claimed historical ownership of the building,” they said. “We are disappointed that the council do not appear to have challenged this claim, despite the council being in possession of Portstewart Town Hall since .     “Following a request from Portstewart Community Association, the Council is meeting on Monday  September to discuss the matter of Portstewart Town Hall. “Unfortunately, this meeting is being held in committee, meaning that we, the public, will be unable to listen to or participate in this meeting. “We are again asking councillors to vote to pause all legal proceedings in relation to Portstewart Town Hall. “Without this vote, the legal proceedings will continue as per the previous Council decision, and the Town Hall will be lost to the people of Portstewart.” The petition has been signed by  people to date, with the Council due to meet this evening at .pm.  Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.    Sinn Feacutein councillor denied permission to speak after fool comment  A point of order was called by DUP councillors Adrian McQuillan and William Duddy.    No budget yet agreed for Councils proposed air show in   Discussion on the event prompted heated exchanges during the Leisure and Development Committee.

However, Mr Durkan noted his disappointment that the Bill as it currently stands fails to protect people vulnerable to gambling related harm. He has demanded regulation both North and South to protect , problem gamblers. googletag.cmd.push Speaking ahead of the Second Stage of the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill, the Foyle MLA said: “Gambling addiction has been a scourge within our communities. “It has destroyed iniduals and their families with its far-reaching implications – not just the financial impact but the toll this addiction has on people’s mental health, wellbeing and the hold it can take over lives. “While I welcome steps taken to address gambling related harm within the gambling legislation, it’s clear that it falls short of what is needed and does little to protect vulnerable people here. “The North has the highest rates of problem gamblers across the islands – it is critical that gambling laws now are as robust as they need to be.” Mr Durkan also hit out at Sinn Feacutein for not pushing the same line in the North as they have done in the Republic. He added: “This issue is not isolated to the North but rather is a problem for the whole of this island. “I note with interest that Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeys own party has contributed to a similar debate in the Daacuteil calling for all the bells and whistles we would like to have seen within this legislation in a  counties ‘Gambling Strategy’: a gambling regulator, online regulation and self-exclusion regulation.     “My question is, why has Minister Hargey opted to deviate from Sinn Feacutein policy here in the North  Surely, we should be pushing for an all-island strategy. We desperately need regulation both North and South. “The Minister and by extension the Executive cannot run the risk of missing the opportunity now to implement a fit for purpose gambling strategy when given the chance.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Mid Ulster District Council have called on Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon to withdraw a Planning Advice Noticeissued last month. Chair and Deputy Chair of the Councils Planning Committee, Cllrs Kyle Black and Sean McPeake, have written to DfI after aspecial meeting of the Planning Committee agreed that the new ‘Planning Advice Note for Development in the Countryside’ would have serious ramications for rural communities and the Council’s ability to make planning decisions which accommodate rural dwellings. googletag.cmd.push The issue centres on a new definition of buildings which can be taken into consideration when assessing a planning application for development on a farm and proposes that a group of buildings which include a house and domestic garage should not be included. The new policy advice would, according to the Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Kyle Black, be so restrictive as to prevent many people from getting a perfectly sustainable rural dwelling: “In Mid Ulster, the proportion of new dwellings allowed in the countryside is lower than the proportion of people living in the countryside, he said. “There is no need, therefore, to place any additional limitations on development in rural areas. “In fact, I would argue that there is a need to explore policy to provide additional sustainable opportunities for Mid Ulster’s existing rural dwellers. “This policy would effectively tie our hands when it comes to making decisions tailored to, and based on, the needs of local people, which is what the transfer of planning powers to local council was all about”.     Deputy Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Sean McPeake, said the area had the space required. “While other councils may face pressures in terms of accommodating rural development, we in Mid Ulster have the capacity to absorb new dwellings, he said. “To address the issue with a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate, reasonable or fair. “We are also concerned that the guidance could prejudice our ability to progress our Draft Local Development Plan which has been, rightly, developed to ensure that we take account of the very specic planning needs of our rural communities”. A letter has been issued to the Minister detailing the Committee’s objections and asking her to withdraw the planning advice guidance.  County Derry planners considering legal action over department advice  Department for Infrastructure insist no changes have been made to the existing policy    GUEST COLUMN: Council can stand up for people of Mid Ulster region  A local planner accuses the Department of a Belfast First approach.  Liam Ward from Ward Design in Castledawson comments on a new planning document which could help shape the future development of local areas.

The meeting, held privately ‘in committee’, discussed legal advice given to the council over a ‘Notice to Quit’ served on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council in  regarding Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push The Council had taken a -year lease on the building in the s, which had subsequently expired, and the buildings owners, the Montagu Estate, who will now resume control of the building. A local community group had launched a petition urging the Council to pause legal proceedings on the handover, but Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens, Cllr Richard Holmes, said they were ‘free to negotiate’ with the Montagu Estate over its use. ”The ownership of Portstewart Town Hall has been under detailed consideration by Council for over two years,” he said. “In March , the Council made a decision which was not challenged using any of the normal channels, either call-in or rescinding motion. “That decision was to acknowledge the Montagu Estate’s Notice to Quit and the nub of the issue here is the ownership of the building. “While the council is progressing with the hand back of the building, the community is free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. “Preliminary work to establish the need for community space in Portstewart has already begun as proposed by council members.     “The town is also served by Flowerfield Arts Centre, the Warren and numerous other community spaces.” Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said they would ‘continue to consult with local residents and interested stakeholders about the potential future use of these as viable alternatives’.  Ongoing petition urging Council to keep County Derry town hall  The Council will hold a confidential meeting tonight to discuss legal advice on the halls ownership.

The representative for the Sperrin ward was commenting ahead of Thursdays meeting of Derry  Strabane Council where Sinn Feacutein intend to table a motion calling for social care reform. googletag.cmd.push Ms Boyle said that staff shortages and the need for fairer wages that cover travel costs and a lack of pathways for career progression were putting additional pressure on staff and patients. Cllr. Boyle said: “No one doubts there are massive pressures and challenges facing our social care system which is impacting on the ability to deliver high quality domiciliary care within the community. “That was true before the pandemic but has been greatly exacerbated over the past  months. “There are major problems over a lack of workforce planning, leading to staff shortages and high vacancy rates which in turn puts additional pressure on staff, service users and their families. “There is a clear need to improve the terms and conditions of domiciliary care staff, including rates of pay, covering travel costs, and providing career progression pathways. “All that is vitalwe are to ensure that the social care system is fit for purpose now and into the future so that those who need care are properly looked after and staff are properly valued. “To that end, I hope that all parties can support my motion at the full council meeting as it will call on the Western Health and Social Care Trust to provide us with a detailed briefing on the current position regarding social care.     “We are also calling on the Minister of Health to outline his plans to reform adult social care, including a detailed report into the true cost of delivering all aspects of the necessary changes.” In response, Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed his intention to launch a public consultation on reforming adult social care. The consultation will begin later this year. The Minister stated: “I am on record as describing Northern Ireland’s social care system as not fit for purpose. “This was also a central conclusion of the independent Power to People review commissioned by the Department of Health and published in late . “We need to increase the quantity of social care to meet growing demand, we need to improve the quality of social care so that people can live with dignity and independence and we need a fair and equitable answer to the questions of who pays and what and when they pay. “We also need to do right by those hard working and dedicated people who work in this sector, often for minimum wage and in some cases, in real terms, even less than minimum wage. “These are not new challenges though the need to address them becomes more pressing with every day. Solving them will not be easy or cheap which is why they have unfortunately been kicked down the road time after time. That has to stop. “I will be launching a public consultation on reforming social care in Northern Ireland later this year.

The representative for the Sperrin ward was commenting ahead of Thursdays meeting of Derry  Strabane Council where Sinn Feacutein intend to table a motion calling for social care reform. googletag.cmd.push Ms Boyle said that staff shortages and the need for fairer wages that cover travel costs and a lack of pathways for career progression were putting additional pressure on staff and patients. Cllr. Boyle said: “No one doubts there are massive pressures and challenges facing our social care system which is impacting on the ability to deliver high quality domiciliary care within the community. “That was true before the pandemic but has been greatly exacerbated over the past  months. “There are major problems over a lack of workforce planning, leading to staff shortages and high vacancy rates which in turn puts additional pressure on staff, service users and their families. “There is a clear need to improve the terms and conditions of domiciliary care staff, including rates of pay, covering travel costs, and providing career progression pathways. “All that is vitalwe are to ensure that the social care system is fit for purpose now and into the future so that those who need care are properly looked after and staff are properly valued. “To that end, I hope that all parties can support my motion at the full council meeting as it will call on the Western Health and Social Care Trust to provide us with a detailed briefing on the current position regarding social care.     “We are also calling on the Minister of Health to outline his plans to reform adult social care, including a detailed report into the true cost of delivering all aspects of the necessary changes.” In response, Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed his intention to launch a public consultation on reforming adult social care. The consultation will begin later this year. The Minister stated: “I am on record as describing Northern Ireland’s social care system as not fit for purpose. “This was also a central conclusion of the independent Power to People review commissioned by the Department of Health and published in late . “We need to increase the quantity of social care to meet growing demand, we need to improve the quality of social care so that people can live with dignity and independence and we need a fair and equitable answer to the questions of who pays and what and when they pay. “We also need to do right by those hard working and dedicated people who work in this sector, often for minimum wage and in some cases, in real terms, even less than minimum wage. “These are not new challenges though the need to address them becomes more pressing with every day. Solving them will not be easy or cheap which is why they have unfortunately been kicked down the road time after time. That has to stop. “I will be launching a public consultation on reforming social care in Northern Ireland later this year. Options to be addressed in this consultation will include introducing a cap on care costs incurred by iniduals, but this cannot be looked at in isolation from the need to signicantly increase investment. “Reforming social care is one of the biggest and most important issues facing Government. I am looking forward to a wide ranging and informed public discussion on how best to get it right.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.  DERRY CITY: Gartside, Lafferty, McJannett, Toal, Boyce , Harkin , Hery , Fitzgerald , McGonigle , Akintunde, Ogedi-Uzokwe.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI. Thank you so much to the Air Ambulance team mdash you are amazing.With the recent easing of restrictions, Joanne was recently able to visit the Air Ambulance NI airbase and meet with representatives of the medical team.Joanne is encouraging the entire Equestrian Community to support her campaign. You can do so by Supporting the Horse Powered Take Off competition via https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off .Including Ambulance NI in your horse show, such as by making a small donation from ticket sales.Organising your own lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo event, such as a cake sale, tea party, sponsored give away, or hack and snack.Working alongside Dragon competitions, Joannersquos competition will run throughout September and October and she has secured some fabulous prizes, including an equine bundle worth pound, from Fane Valley, pound, in cash and a horse solarium worth pound from R Nesbit Paddock Equipment. The winners will be drawn on October  by Dragon Competitions.Grace Williams, Area Fundraising Manager for Air Ambulance NI, said: ldquoWe are so inspired that Joanne has made a great recovery.

For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

Back in third came Amlad.For winning rider James OrsquoSullivan it was his first success for Raffrey trainer Colin McBratney, who was recording his first track success in a year.The winner is owned by Comber contractor James Murdoch and it was good to see these colours in the winnerrsquos enclosure as they were used to for many years by his late father, better known as The Rancher and a real gentleman. SP:  ,  , fav  .The second locally owned, trained and bred winner came in the Northern Ireland On Course Bookmakers Handicap Hurdle when recent course winner Willyouwalkwithme, with Wexford jockey Shane Fitzgerald in the saddle, made every post a winning one to beat Fassbender, ridden by Denis OrsquoRegan and regular runner at Downpatrick Alexharwill, ridden by local jockey Ryan Treacy.The winner is one of only three horses owned and trained at Ballyclare by former top stock car driver Harry Smyth, who at the age of  is Northern Irelandrsquos senior trainer,Itrsquos hard to believe that Harry, who has a good strike rate and has reasonably training fees is not supported by owners at Sligo.

It was also a welcome success for Ballynoe trainer Brian Hamilton, who has a large string in training at present. SP:  ,  ,   fav.Also over fences was the Beginners Chase and as The Abbey held a clear lead over the last fence it looked like Davy Russell was going to record a winningto action, but on the climb to the winning post he had to give best to Hurricane Georgie, ridden by Jordan Gainford, with Seanbhothar back in third.Both first and second are trained by Gordon Elliott, who has not lost any time getting back into the winnerrsquos enclosure following his six month suspension.So long champion trainer at the local track, he then went on to record a double with   fav Top Bandit, with Jamie Codd on board, a very easy winner of the bumper.

When Seamus passed away Corinne had horses in her own name or as part of a syndicate. She was a well known figure at local point-to-points in her wax coat and wellies, often accompanied by her dogs and daughter Peita.Another great loss to local racing.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

Please try again later.Submitting...Yet there is a respect in which state service provision in NI works well, ornot well then better than the private alternative: MOT tests.These road worthiness tests are essential to keeping our highways safe, yet in Great Britain they are done in private garages. This can create an incentive for the said garages to exaggerate the amount of work that is needed on a car before it is deemed fit for continuing usage.In NI, however, we have a rigorous system of testing centres which assess the car independent of any private interests. You might think that your car failed because your examiner was over zealous. You might even wonderhe or she was harsher because they did not like the look of you. But you cannot think you were failed because the tester wanted your business.However, the NI MOT system has at dferent points over the years been subject to delays that make it hard to a book a test in time for your road worthiness certicate’s renewal date. A recent upgrade of the booking system did not help.One of the worst such delays to testing has been caused by Covid. The slowdown in testing capacity during lockdown was alleviated by a temporary extension in the time interval between mandatory tests from one year to two.The testing system is now said to be back to normal.This is good because had it been thrown badly out of kilter, resulting in permanent delays, it might have brought our sound MOT procedures unfairly into disrepute, leading to a clamour for GB’s inferior private system.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He also flagged issues with the initiatives planned for Scotland and Wales, including a legal challenge against the Holyrood government’s plan.“I’m not convinced that this is the right policy for a number of reasons,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.Mr Lyons said the scheme would present “legal and human rights issues”.“I think it is important that we take those on board and look in particular at who that’s most likely to affect,” he said.“I think we also have to look at how this would be implemented as well – would this become a permanent feature, would it be extended beyond indoor events to other public events to hospitality “What about people then who work in those sectors. If you have a job would you need to have a vaccine passport as well  What systems would need to be in place for it to happen, what additional burdens would there be for business ”Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill has raised human rights concerns about such an initiative.However, last week she suggested she would still be “very open” to a passport schemeit could be demonstrated it could contribute to the “greater good” of tackling the spread of Covid-.Her party colleague Chris Hazzard told the BBC: “We’ve always been clear that we want to follow the medical and scientic advice andthat advice is that the best way forward is to look at that , then we’re absolutely willing to look at that.“It has never come forward as an option as far as I understand from the CMOto be able to look at that.“Sothat’s on the table then we’ll be more than happy to do so.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularThe unionist parties come together to reject the Northern Ireland Protocol, and call for its replacement with arrangements that respect NI’s place in UKEx UDR soldier: I would never have missed the fine th anniversary tribute parade in Lisburn to an almost forgotten armyFormer IRA ‘folk hero’ is ‘hardly fitting face for Amnesty International campaign’ say unionistsThe DUP support for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea in  was a catastrophic error — one of the worst unionist mis-judgements of recent historyBrothers’ ‘emotional’ meeting with RUC man they saw ‘killed’ as children in  by IRA sniperMost PopularOwen Polley: Britain should stand up without fear to President Joe Biden over Northern IrelandSex offender can resume parental responsibility for child, court rulesKiller of prison officer Adrian Ismay seeks to overturn convictionVaccine passports: NI ‘no longer in the space’ to justy actionDublin UVF bomb victim condemns SDLP and Alliance Party over TUV appointments bill                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Applicants can register for their card at http:nidirect.gov.uk spend-local He said: “Around . million people are entitled to apply for their Spend Local card, so we expect the portal to be extremely busy in the first few days.

So please be patient.” The Minister reminded applicants to have their key information to hand when they come to apply. For verication purposes, all applicants will be asked to provide their name address age gender disability status National Insurance number email address and telephone number.

Therefore, by being patient and ready with your information, you will be helping yourself and everybody .” Minister Lyons also warned people to be wary of scams and emphasised that the Department will never ask anyone for their personal banking details.
