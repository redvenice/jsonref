It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here’I have photographed these sisters, Sam and Lizzy, many times, in many costumes, over many years. This was a particularly difficult time in my life. It was late February, and my mum had been killed in a car crash the September before. After she died, I just wasn’t interested in photography. My mother had liked to sew when I was young, so instead I started cutting up old clothes or using scraps to make crude flags. I was just trying to make sense of what was happening in my world. I thought I might use them as props in the future.I was also going for daily walks with my dog, and a few houses down the road I came across this bizarrely tied-together pegboard fence. I see things cinematically. Bits of stories emerge from whatever I’m looking at. This image came from me sitting at my mother’s sewing machine, sewing those flags, and then finding that fence. I called up Sam and Lizzy and said: “I really need to do a picture – I need you to come over.”I’ve been collecting uniforms for a long time. I link it to my mother and my Roman Catholic upbringing, and the fact that we’re from a military family – my dad was a pilot. There was always a uniform tucked around somewhere. The ceremony, the iconography, the formality all appealed to me. This shot wasn’t so much about the specific uniform the girls are wearing, but the palette of those red jackets against that pink fence.It was the middle of winter, on a day that had started out cloudy but then we got this really nice band of light. I love how alike the girls look. They’re a year apart, but even their mother couldn’t tell who was who in the picture. They’re not professional models, but I knew I could do something interesting with them. I didn’t realise why at the time, but I needed a sense of forward movement in the poses they struck. My mother was on my mind on the day of the shoot. “It’s time,” she’d say, “time to do what you do.” She was always creative, and very encouraging. After the shoot, because I wasn’t really working, I had the luxury of being able to spend several months manipulating the image, printing and reprinting it. I was thinking about Velázquez and working on the lights and darks – the different blacks, in particular.This was in the months leading up to to the 2016 election. I’m from Texas, and I split my time between Dallas and Marfa, which is about 60 miles from the Mexican border. It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here. This image might not be a traditional version of what Texas looks like, but to me it is quite Texan, at least in my fantasy world.I started thinking about the role fantasy plays in everything – identity politics, cultural pluralism, nationalism – and these blended geographic areas that are constantly changing. I started researching the archetypes of the wild west and how they were interpreted by the Italians and the Spanish in spaghetti westerns. I watched a lot of Sergio Leone movies – I must have rewatched the last 10 minutes of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 100 times – and listened to Quentin Tarantino interviews. And so this image launched an entire project, a contemporary staged spaghetti western, entitled Smoke Bombs and Border Crossings, which featured three main archetypal characters: the military soldier, the American cowboy and the Mexican charro, or traditional horseman.I’ve had such a strange few years. I had my own car wreck last year, very close to where my mother died. I broke both legs, in several places, and an arm.

Yet the real decisions are still to be madeDawn, 24 June 2016. College Green. That small patch of grass opposite the Palace of Westminster. A flag-waving group of men – Nigel Farage and co – celebrates raucously. An ashen-faced Jeremy Corbyn arrives to tell the prime minister that article 50 should be triggered immediately. A senior FT reporter runs past, gasping that “the PM’s resigned and it’s only the third story on our website”. And so, the post-referendum odyssey began. In the sun, on the Green, with everyone going bonkers.It’s been three and a half long years, in which we have learned a number of things about not only Brexit but also ourselves. First, breaking up is hard to do. The problems we have faced in trying to leave the EU stand as a testament to how right the Brexiters were all along: this isn’t a simple trading block, it is far, far, more. And disentangling the relationship has likewise proved far more complicated than many people – including most high-profile Brexiters – ever imagined. Think of Northern Ireland and those endless debates over backstops and borders. Think of the power wielded over Theresa May by a party few in Great Britain had ever heard of, let alone understood.And at the same time, we’ve come to understand that our most treasured institutions are perhaps more fragile than we’d suspected. From the apolitical civil service, vilified and abused by politicians who should know better, to judges, attacked from parliament and on the front pages of the tabloid press. From the devolution settlement, buttressed by a Sewel convention that, like Jack Sparrow’s pirates’ code, turns out to be more “guidelines than rules”” To the sovereignty of parliament, neatly sidestepped by the government, who closed it down for a while. Much of what we have taken for granted about our country now appears vulnerable.Which brings us to the politicians. Many of the problems we have faced have stemmed from the dysfunctionality of our politics since that June poll. It was the inability of the cabinet and then parliament to agree what they wanted, not the failure of civil servants, that was largely responsible for the Brexit impasse. Olly Robbins became an unfortunate scapegoat for others’ incompetence. Civil servants didn’t fail their political leaders. Quite the contrary.And isions were compounded by the low calibre of many of those in the top jobs. You might have thought that a leader of the opposition would understand what article 50 was before recommending its triggering. But no. Corbyn shot from the hip. Speak in haste, don’t repent ever.As for the former prime minister, where to start? First, she painted herself into a corner by turning a soundbite (“control over our borders, laws and money”) into negotiating red lines. Second, she prioritised Conservative party unity over forging a national consensus. And third, she called an unnecessary snap election that left her a hostage of the Democratic Unionist party and European Research Group. You might also have hoped that the resident of 10 Downing Street would be capable of making difficult choices and explaining fundamental tradeoffs. Yet May persisted in asking for the impossible: frictionless trade while leaving the single market and customs union.And just consider the other abject nonsense we’ve had to tolerate. The pointless adjective war of that first summer – hard Brexit, soft Brexit, clean Brexit, chaotic Brexit, managed Brexit, red white and blue Brexit, dog’s Brexit. And then the real rubbish: “no deal is better than a bad deal” “a jobs-first Brexit” “a second referendum to overcome ision” (I ask you) and, of course, “get Brexit done”.Failure, of course, was not confined to those in positions of influence. Honourable mentions go to those who either wanted to prevent Brexit or to “soften” it. The former ran perhaps the least effective campaign since, well, the campaign against Brexit in the referendum. The latter – allegedly determined to deliver Brexit, but a soft one – distinguished themselves by voting against precisely that on 29 March 2019. Of course, support for the third meaningful vote would not have guaranteed a soft Brexit – let’s not forget the stalwarts of the ERG and their endless capacity to cause trouble. But the May deal offered far more to those interested in retaining close ties with the EU than anything that’s going to be on offer now.So yes, we’ve all had a lot to deal with. We’ve lived through three tumultuous years, during which we’ve hardly covered ourselves in glory. Yet while it’s tempting to look back on that morning of June 2016 as day zero, it wasn’t. Many of the changes we’ve seen subsequently have been years in the making. Labour was losing “leave” seats long before Vote Leave was a glint in Dominic Cummings’ eye. In 2010, the 62 seats lost by the party in England and Wales that have not been regained since, have an almost identical “Brexit profile” to the 54 fresh losses in 2019.Moreover, while lots has happened – the period since the referendum has ended the careers of two prime ministers, eight cabinet ministers and over 80 MPs – we shouldn’t assume this churn is the new normal. Four years hence, as we turn our minds to the next election, politics may have repositioned itself around a more traditional left-right axis a berated and battered civil service may have retained its core values Scotland may have voted for independence from the UK. Who knows, we may even have devoted some time, energy and money to dealing with the UK’s underlying problems: pervasive inequality (entrenched by austerity and neglect of key public services) and stagnant productivity.And, of course, a majority government may have made parliament reassuringly boring again. But beware. Boredom is a dangerous thing. The choices stemming from Brexit are arguably more significant than the choice to leave in the first place. How paradoxical if, at the moment when the real decisions are being made, our interest starts to falter.• Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d905d503cf7de570c5dd09b8888013934a087ad/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=834caa0604a99bd03b2f2eb83b328a78","title":"labour leave remain divide brexit","story":"Tomorrow, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. Some will celebrate, some will mourn, and others will just get on with their lives. The debate over whether we are in or out of the EU is over, but the debate over the kind of country we want to become has only just begun.As a country we’ve been bitterly ided for three and a half years. Our politics has been frozen instead of tackling the real and deep-rooted problems we face.Now the leave-remain ide must end. Defining people by how they voted in June 2016 merely upholds a ide that we must overcome. There are no leavers or remainers any more. In 2024 there will be no leave or remain constituencies.This morning, in a typical classroom of 30 children, nine of them will be living in poverty. The morning after we’ve left the EU, this will still be a reality for those children and their families. It will be the same in a year’s time, and a year after that, unless we do something. The Conservatives are using the rhetoric of sovereignty as cover for the systematic disempowerment of all of us – ever lower wages, fewer workplace rights, weaker environmental protections. Inequality is not an act of God or nature – it is the result of political decisions, but we can change them if we choose to.Brexit will not put right the problems that led so many to vote leave. They are the result of years of failure, which we will put right only when we stop diagnosing and start treating. We can fix the broken political system that closed off investment and opportunity to whole regions and communities. We can take on the failed market economy that has pushed millions into poverty. We’re not the luckless victims of the unimaginably wealthy. But power concedes nothing without a demand. We can make those demands, because we know what is needed to create the country we want to live in.Seventy-five years ago Britain’s great generation won the war, helping to free occupied Europe and liberate the concentration camps. They dreamed of a better future and they trusted Labour to “win the peace”. That Labour generation rebuilt our country after the devastation of war and created a new settlement that lasted for generations. The NHS, the welfare state, decent affordable council homes, the promise of the new towns and civic pride and placing great industries and national infrastructure under democratic control: this was their achievement and it created a better life for millions. Our present Labour generation must summon that same spirit of courage and radicalism to “win the peace” again after the isions of Brexit.It’s clear our politics is broken. This week I’ve travelled the length and breadth of the UK talking about radical plans to devolve power away from Whitehall to the nations, regions, cities and towns. But this can’t just be about transferring power from one set of politicians to another. I believe the fight for social, economic and climate justice can only be won if we put real power directly in the hands of the people.The market economy has failed and left millions in poverty. Under privatisation our probation service does not work, our railways do not work. I want new forms of common ownership that give frontline workers and the people who use our public services the power to influence how they are run. Real democratic accountability to the people, not statism.The green new deal must be hardwired into everything we do because we’re in an epochal battle to save our planet. That means a major role for government in stronger regulation and redirecting investment. It also means empowering communities and activists to take action for themselves, like Labour-run Plymouth council has done by setting up dozens of community-owned sustainable energy co-ops.And I want to scrap the Tory welfare reforms that humiliate the very people they should be helping. I will end the cruelty of work capability assessments and halt the punitive sanctions that push people into destitution. Instead, people who are unemployed or living with disabilities will have a say over the kind of support they need. A real voice for everyone and the power to make it heard.Britain is an outward-looking country with a proud history of internationalism and co-operation. When Boris Johnson decided last week to turn away child refugees, he stood in the face of those values. Instead of this, the government ought to begin to heal isions. We need long-overdue security for EU citizens. The government should give all 3 million EU nationals living in the UK full voting rights in future elections. The way they have been treated over the past three years is shameful. We were never just “tolerating” EU citizens living in this country – they are our neighbours, friends and families. To see their status in doubt devastates our sense not just of justice but also of fellowship.Basic social justice demands that we always stand up for citizens’ rights and oppose trade deals that put our NHS or public services up for sale. We must make the case for a close economic relationship with the EU that protects jobs and allows us to cooperate in other fields.We’ll shine a light on the Conservatives’ failures and the damage they will inevitably do. We must raise our sights with a vision that matches the ambition of the British people. We must summon the courage that led Labour’s post-war generation to remake this country with a radical vision of a fairer future.Labour has lost four elections in a row: we simply cannot afford to lose the next one. I will move our party on from the ision of the past and remake our party as a democratic movement that faces outwards towards the country, not inwards on itself. Endless Conservative government is not inevitable.

In it the rightwing academic tarred managers who thought there were corporate responsibilities beyond profits as “unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society”. Friedman’s view of shareholder primacy became the conventional wisdom, boosted by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Since 1979 the idea that only company owners are the rightful claimants of the fruits of the economy gained traction. Nowadays shareholders are the central actor in economic life. This has been a damaging and unwise road to take.Putting shareholders first means less cash for workers and other stakeholders, hampering efforts to tackle in-work poverty and climate change. While the UK’s largest listed companies have doubled in a decade the amount paid out to shareholders (a record £110bn last year), the average wage in November 2019, measured as weekly real pay, was lower than in February 2008. If the £110bn was ided up between the 5 million people employed by the FTSE 100 companies, each worker would receive £22,000 each.It is worth noting that Friedman’s pull is so strong that idend payouts almost never fall, irrespective of profitability. This is not the only way to funnel cash back to shareholders: since 2011 about £20bn a year has been spent by companies on share buybacks in the UK. Prem Sikka of Essex University has pointed out that “share buybacks have consistently exceeded share issuance over the past decade”, turning stock markets into cash extraction machines.While the candidates for the Labour party leadership are engaged in a competition over who can dream up the most nostalgic of left policies, it may be worth the party spending some time thinking about how to ensure increases in business profits are effectively directed to job-creating investment. This would require challenging the Friedmanite consensus around shareholder primacy. If Labour chooses to retreat into the comfort zone of nationalisation, it will find its slogans lifted by Boris Johnson who has no compunction in doing so if it wins votes.What the Conservative party is much less likely to do is to repurpose the firm into a more egalitarian vehicle for social change. John McDonnell’s policy of inclusive ownership funds, drawn from work by the Common Wealth thinktank, did just that. The idea was for businesses to issue a sliver of equity each year to a fund controlled by staff. This would not only pay idends to employees but also give them a vote as shareholders. Rewarding bosses with stock has been the norm for years, and if it is good enough for them, why not the same for workers? Labour’s possible leaders ought to be much more engaged with this work if they want territory beyond Friedman that the Tories would find it hard to co-opt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f328ae4230d567c94a6f1fbd38df45cbfbe43a8/161_124_745_447/master/745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b214ecdfc88be09d1655df36080db594","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The private detective firm has a staff largely consisting of alumni of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.Under questioning by Manhattan prosecutors, Sen said that on 11 July 2017 – three months before the New York Times came out with its bombshell article revealing that Weinstein had paid off multiple women over decades to bury their sexual harassment complaints – Boies Schiller signed a contract with Black Cube. The deal was sealed under the instructions of Weinstein.The jury was not given details about the nature of the contract. But in legal argument in court on Thursday out of the earshot of jurors, key details of its contents were discussed.Lawyers read out elements of the contract. One excerpt said Black Cube was employed to “provide intelligence which will help the client’s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper”.The contract also included a bonus clause under which Black Cube would be paid $300,000 if they actually succeeded in foiling publication of the Times article.During heated legal argument, the lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon argued that the contract “shows that the defendant was concerned about an article coming out and he was looking for Anabella Sciorra to be investigated”. Sciorra is one of six women who feature in the Weinstein rape trial.Last week Sciorra gave dramatic evidence in which she described allegedly being raped by the film producer in her Manhattan apartment in the winter of 1993-94.Weinstein faces five counts that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. He is charged with two counts of rape, one that he forcibly performed oral sex on a woman and two counts of predatory sexual assault.He denies all the charges.Thursday’s testimony and legal arguments corroborated the work of the journalists who exposed the elaborate operation created by Weinstein and his associates in an attempt to try to prevent his alleged sexual misconduct and crimes ever seeing the light of day.The Black Cube contract was first reported by Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker, who revealed that the Israeli firm, on Weinstein’s dollar, deployed a number of investigators using false identities to befriend women accusing the movie titan of sexual misconduct and extract information from them.Farrow also revealed that the contract discussed in court on Thursday was signed personally by David Boies. The news sent waves through legal circles, because Boies had been seen as a champion of liberal causes, representing Al Gore in his fight with George Bush over the results of the 2000 presidential election and invalidating California’s ban on gay marriage.In the wake of the shocking disclosure that Boies had been involved in employing a private detective firm in an attempt to scupper a New York Times article at the very same time as he was employed as a legal adviser to the New York Times, the newspaper decided to cut ties with him.Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer at the trial, Donna Rotunno, managed to squeeze in a compliment for Boies during cross-examination. She asked Sen to agree that “Mr Boies does have a wonderful reputation in New York and worldwide.”Prosecutors instantly objected to the question, and the judge, James Burke, sustained the intervention, striking the remark from the record."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f42f17efe241c188c5bd5e94a04b787eafa4084/20_132_1969_1181/master/1969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f76dec8988f80edd527a2a97f87c7c60","title":"the most disturbing talking animals in film ranked","story":"As Dolittle hits the multiplex of our hearts, we take a look at the creepiest vocalising varmints of cinema historyImagine Dolittle, but about a depressed zookeeper whose girlfriend had left him because he was a zookeeper, and the subsequent efforts of the animals at the zoo to teach the zookeeper how to get laid.

Voiced by Tim McIntire, Blood’s one job is to find post-apocalyptic women for Don Johnson to have sex with in return for food. They eat a woman at the end. Like I said, not for kids.First there was a talking baby. Then there were two talking babies. And then, in the third Look Who’s Talking film, they introduced a dog. Voiced by Danny DeVito, Rocks was a dog so sexually confident that his opening line to a poodle is: “What do you say you and me go play Bury the Bone?” He accuses his best friend of being the product of incest. Why is he called Rocks, you ask? Because he’s incontinent. This is a kid’s film.The first film produced by MTV, Joe’s Apartment was about a slobby man whose home is invaded by an army of talking cockroaches. Billy West plays Ralph, the leader of the cockroaches, with other cockroaches voiced by Tim Blake Nelson and Dave Chapelle. If you like films where maniacally giggling cockroaches crawl through food, perform Busby Berkeley dance numbers on top of a filthy toilet and crawl under the skirts of terrified women, this is the film for you.By 1988, Bobcat Goldthwait was hot property. His presence helped to elevate three successive Police Academy movies and it seemed as if anything was possible. But then he made Hot to Trot, a film about a talking horse and everything fell apart. It was not just any talking horse but a talking horse that passes on stock tips to Goldthwait, becomes richer than its wildest dreams, moves into Goldthwait’s apartment, wrecks it after a riotous all-animal party, is visited by the spirit of his father in the form of a fly and then wins a race by talking all the other horses out of running. Weird that it didn’t do better.In a film called Cats \u0026amp Dogs, of course the dogs are going to be the protagonists. Cats could never be the hero of a story. Cats are awful. And therefore it makes complete sense that the primary antagonist of Cats \u0026amp Dogs would be Mr Tinkles, an evil, spoilt persian who Weekend at Bernies his infirm billionaire human owner in an effort to destroy the entire world. I’ve met cats. This behaviour tracks.Shortly before he switched careers and became a genuinely disturbing once-a-year festive YouTuber, Kevin Spacey made the worst film of his life. Barry Sonnenfeld’s Nine Lives is basically Liar Liar except – and this is a big except – instead of being forced to tell the truth, a negligent father is transformed into a cat named Mr Fuzzypants. Want to know how Mr Fuzzypants saves the day? He doesn’t. He falls from the top of a skyscraper and dies horribly after mistaking his adult human base-jumping son for a man attempting suicide. I mean, where to start? The part when Mike Myers’s cat is so aroused by a photo of a woman that his hat goes stiff? The part when he bends over and his fur rides up revealing a human bottom? The part when he repeatedly threatens to murder a second cat, also played by Myers, with a knife? The part when attempts to tongue-kiss a garden implement he had previously called a “dirty hoe”? The part when he spells the word “Shit”? The part where he goes to a nightclub to ogle Paris Hilton? This film was such a mess that the Seuss estate banned the entire film industry from making another live action adaptation.One of the 33 films (seriously) that Eric Roberts made in 2013, A Talking Cat!?! is probably the most notorious. It’s a film about a cat that can talk to people, but only once per person, and only in the distracted, poorly recorded, down-the-line drawl of Eric Roberts while its mouth forms a badly animated black slit. The AV Club said the film “is The Room of anthropomorphic animal movies featuring Eric Roberts” and, in the one known piece of promotion Roberts did for this film, he said of it: “Hey, it is what it is, pal.”You will have noticed by now that the top 5 of this Ranked! are all cats. That’s because I saw Cats at the cinema and I now hate cats. Picking a weirdest cat from the Cats lineup is almost impossible (the railway cat? The cat with boobs? Jason Derulo’s Towie cat? The suicidal cat?) and yet Rebel Wilson’s Jennyanydots makes the choice a little easier. Because Jennanydots is the masturbating cat who unzips her own skin and eats mice that for some reason have the voice of screaming children. I hate cats now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efd3123899d2071b2353e4a7354fb64b732afbf/150_0_2699_1620/master/2699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f3572b6472910672116b2fa83fd5b9","title":"what can we learn about coronavirus from watching contagion","story":"Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 thriller about the spread of a deadly virus has been back in the iTunes Top 10 – so is this epidemic another thing we can blame on Gwyneth Paltrow?Conventional wisdom has it that audiences flock to escapism in troubled times, but an unexpected new entry on the UK iTunes movie rental chart suggests otherwise. Nestling among the current hits is a film made nine years ago that paints a more terrifying picture of humanity than Joker and Downton Abbey combined. As the coronavirus scythes outwards from China, there have been enough rentals of Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 thriller Contagion to propel the movie into the Top 10. (At the time of writing, it’s at No 13.) The picture, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and concerns a deadly virus with the potential to decimate the global population, has, in a very real sense, gone viral.Twitter users have been posting variations on the theme of: “Is it just me or did Contagion predict the coronavirus?” I missed Soderbergh’s film when it was released, and I happen also to be frightened of dying from viral pneumonia, so I killed two birds with one download and watched the movie this week. It’s true that the similarities are striking enough to suggest a case of life imitating … well, if not art exactly, then a top-of-the-line B-movie. In both fictional and real-life cases, the outbreak originates in China and in each instance bats are implicated. As a doctor (played by Jennifer Ehle) at the Centers for Disease Control explains: “Somewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.” Worst Tinder date ever.One Twitter user, mariow08, identified another possible culprit: “As with many things,” he tweeted, “it’s probably Gwyneth Paltrow’s fault.” This is not an allusion to the fact that the first reports of the coronavirus reached the World Health Organization less than a month before Paltrow’s healing-and-wellness documentary series The Goop Lab came to Netflix. In the case of the virus in Contagion, it really does seem to have been Paltrow’s fault – sort of. The virus goes from bat to pig to a chef who touches her without washing his hands. She hops on a plane home to her husband, played by Matt Damon, after cheating on him with an old flame, so in conventional movie morality terms she deserves what she gets when she expires shortly after the monogamous Damon, on the other hand, miraculously survives. Fidelity to one’s partner is in many cases to be recommended, though viewers should not infer from Contagion that this will provide immunity to coronavirus.There is no word yet on how the growing audience for Contagion is ided among countries or continents, but it must be the case that viewers have been watching it as a sort of “how to” guide in the event of a catastrophe in their vicinity. Or at least a “what to” – what to expect when you’re expecting an epidemic.With streaming being a recent phenomenon, it is hard to say whether there was a direct precedent for the spike in rentals of old movies during similarly unforeseen events. Perhaps in the 90s, there would have been a stampede down to Blockbuster to fight over the five VHS copies of Outbreak, a schlocky but efficient example of the genre in which Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Spacey battle a killer virus. Strange to think that in the midst of the #MeToo era, many people consider Hoffman and Spacey to be at least as disagreeable a prospect as any deadly epidemic.The closest analogy to the Contagion effect would be the death of a celebrity, which always reignites interest in their back catalogue. Rarer are those instances when movies make an accidental prediction or inadvertently nurture some conspiracy theory of the future. The villains in The Long Kiss Goodnight, one of the best films of the 90s, turn out to be US defence officials who plan to stage a terrorist incident and to “blame the Muslims” in an attempt to win a budget increase. (They even mention the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.) And Edward Zwick’s 1998 terrorism thriller, The Siege, felt so close to home after 911 that the Pentagon held a three-day conference with Hollywood screenwriters and producers in which they brainstormed potential worst-case scenarios to get the jump on future atrocities.It is more often the case that cinema capitalises on a pre-existing fear or neurosis. The nuclear meltdown depicted in the 1978 thriller The China Syndrome, starring Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, drew on flaws in operations at the Dresden generating station in Illinois in the early 70s, but also had the good fortune to be released in cinemas just days before the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. Money can’t buy that kind of PR.Perhaps that’s the only silver lining here. A worldwide epidemic is bad news for humanity, but a kind of good news for anyone who worked on The Cassandra Crossing or The Andromeda Strain, Carriers or Contracted, and whose agent had the foresight to negotiate residuals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19f3fd4e115c8ba334806714b474df2b81ac7e28/476_668_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe8378c8a48ec29d1db4a46178ac0e93","title":"the psychology of small plates why food service radically changes how much we eat","story":"Two hundred years ago a group of aristocrats changed the way we eat – for the worse. If you ever worry you’ll still be hungry after dessert, here’s whyI was confronted by a conundrum at the weekend. My sister had made chickpea curry for 14, and a lentil and mushroom curry, also for 14, and there were 22 of us, and if you’re wondering why there was no meat on this table, it’s because all the meat eaters of the older generation are dead. Take heed, carnivores. Oh, but also, there were sausages.Anyway, hours in, when I was on my fourth or fifth helping, I noticed that there was no end to it. No, there was more of it than when we started. There was a lake of chickpeas. We had got to the “Would you like to take some home?” stage. And here’s what was truly bizarre: the quantities weren’t actually for 14 she had taken a recipe for two, and tripled it. So, it was basically two dishes for six, and it could have fed three generations of extended Williamses for a week. How is this possible? How do you explain this exponential thing that happens, when you scale up a recipe a few times and somehow end up with enough to feed 1,000 people?There is food psychology at play: if you experience plenty on a table, you don’t panic that it’s a scarce resource, and you tailor your portion. I once read a detailed analysis of the feeding of the 5,000, which posited that everybody had brought a small amount of food with them, but was excruciated by the potential embarrassment of having to share it with more people than it would feed. Once there were two spare fish kicking around, they felt liberated to crack out the nuts they had in their pocket. It’s possible that I should stop checking out literal-explanations-of-the-Bible websites. But you get the picture: abundance begets generosity, etc.So the question is, why don’t we always eat like this? The Russian service has a lot to answer for.This is the meal convention we have settled on: a series of dishes served one after the other, raising the prospect that you will never quite get enough, unless you are presented from the start with way too much. It began to displace the French service – a table groaning with everything at once – in the early 19th century, but didn’t catch on in Britain for another 60-odd years, although that’s nothing on how long it took us to wake up to garlic.Its benefits were twofold: the food was hotter as you ate it, and it required a lot of servants, so it made you look rich, provided, of course, that you were rich. In its original form, it could range from six courses to 30. You can see the trace of it in the modern tasting menu, favoured by people who look at the lithographs in Charles Ranhofer’s The Epicurean and think: “I wish I could look as bored as that.” (That is monumentally unfair: most of the illustrations are of coffee pots.)Anyway, its bare bones were oysters, soup, fish, entree, roast, pudding. With their abundance and unimaginable poshness, the Russian aristocrats thus completely wiped the table with the French, whose only fightback was cheese. There was a simplified version for people who lacked the staff, known as the English service – soup, starter, roast, served by the actual hosts, which was only one rung above being fed in a stable – and you could argue the toss for ever about whether that caught on, since we have ended up with not 30 courses or even six, but three: a starter, a main course and a pudding. Yet at the same time, the overall fandango is very much rooted in service à la Russe. There’s something about descriptions of pre-revolutionary Russian cooking that is weirdly magical, Harry Potterish: boar, followed by walnuts in honey, followed by pancakes, followed by more boar. I can totally see how this went 19th-century viral.And yet the Russian service, in its modern, restaurant incarnation, is rigid and repetitive – always with the meat and two veg, always not enough of the best thing and too much of the worst, wasteful and inidualistic. Everybody with any sense prefers what I choose to call the Spanish service, based on the discovery of tapas late last century – the freedom of having dishes small enough that you could order more if you wanted, the fellowship of being able to all eat from the whatever plate. You could just as well call it the Chinese service, based on dim sum. But this emphatically is not a return to the groaning tables of 18th-century France, since the dishes are deliberately small, which trend in turn created the Shoreditch service – a number of sharing plates that all cost as much as regular plates but aren’t as big.I suspect the 2020s will see a return to the original ways – huge platters, all on the table at once, creating such an aura of largesse that you feel full just looking at them. Nobody will ever finish, but because the dishes are now made of chickpeas, it won’t matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fa013789ee674697d8b5a7172d32ae1c6082714/0_125_3339_2004/master/3339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461a6ce3ffe7fd8e495dcd648cbaf665","title":"arsenal kim little players union fifpro change right direction","story":"The Arsenal midfielder Kim Little is only 29 but is already thinking about her legacy. “As I’m getting older and have been in the game longer, I keep thinking about how I want to contribute and give back to the game,” says the playmaker.Little still has plenty in her legs, the captain currently guiding Arsenal through four competitions, but she is one of the athletes to have joined Fifpro’s new players’ union, a global players’ council, with an eye to how she can make a broader impact on the game that has given her so much.“Football is such a huge part of our lives,” she says. “It’s given us the opportunity to do a job, a profession, where it never really feels like you’re working, it’s just pure enjoyment. So it’s natural to want to give back and to want to move the game forward, especially with how it’s developed and how it has gone from amateur to professional in quite a short space of time. You want to keep that going and you want to keep providing a place where women and girls can have the opportunity that we have.”There are 14 – male and female – players in the inaugural union, though there will be a fluidity to the structure. From the women’s game the list includes Lyon’s Saki Kumagai and England’s Jodie Taylor and lesser known players from developing leagues such as Argentina’s Gabriela Garton.Little has felt the absence of such a union to turn to in her career. “I think as the game has developed, yes. For me, the development of the game, playing in Scotland, in different countries and different scenarios, with the different challenges there have been in different working environments, have shown me the need for something like this. And this is just the starting point.”A erse body was an attractive feature for Little – who, while injured, was involved in the Scottish national team’s stalemate with the FA over their terms and conditions going into the 2017 European Championship finals – because it gives players the opportunity to link up their struggles.“Our game has changed so dramatically in the last five to 10 years and gone through quite a transition. That’s great, and positive, but it also means things have come so quickly and this is a good opportunity to discuss the issues, the growth of the game, the contrast in different environments and what differs from club to club.“The players’ council gives us the ability to provide support and backing so you don’t feel like it’s just the players fighting for better environments for their national teams alone. It helps provide a bigger picture which is really empowering, knowing you’ve got the backing of not just the people in your team or country but of the profession from a much bigger, global perspective.”The New Zealand international and member of Fifpro’s policy team, Sarah Gregorius, who recruited Little to the union, says the council also “gives an opportunity for stakeholders to listen directly to a player’s voice and to get an understanding of their impression of where things are at and where things should be moving”.She adds: “Particularly for women’s football, with the growth that we’ve seen over recent months to years, ensuring that we have the players’ voices at the heart of this was really important. The council is a really great mechanism and a really great forum for us to do that.”Women have been taking action for better pay, conditions, professionalism and against abuses in increasing numbers in football, from the Afghanistan women’s national team fighting the abuses suffered by their players to the US team battling to be rewarded for their successes in line with what the men would receive should they reach the same heights.As the global players’ union, Fifpro wants to put itself at the forefront of aiding and connecting players going through these disputes. “The knowledge sharing that can happen between the players is hugely valuable, giving an insight into what other national teams are doing, what’s happening in other leagues and what someone’s inidual experience has been in another country,” says Gregorius. “When it comes to having a stand on certain issues there is a genuine opportunity for that as well. Football is very dynamic, things are happening all the time, and I think being able to form these opinions and share experience can really help to solidify strategies and understandings that can elevate the voices of the players – and put them in situations where they can start to affect the decision makers as well.”Getting players involved is tough. The union has had to battle with conflicting team schedules and national team calendars to bring the players together. But equally, getting players to buy into the idea was not hard.“All of the players I’ve spoken to have been immediately excited about the possibilities and believe passionately that there is certainly a need for players to stand up for each other,” says Gregorius. “I’ve been really impressed by that spirit of unionism I suppose. I don’t think it’s a difficult concept for players to grasp, standing together and things like that. I’ve been really impressed by the genuine passion and desire to roll their sleeves up and get to work. It’s been an easy sell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7965984646af17a03eb20b96a3542bdfe6e0190d/192_393_2546_1527/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6ec38fe21ee151cf244823e5aa48bcf","title":"bruno fernandes pass master goals tempo manchester united sporting","story":"Manchester United’s new midfielder gained plenty from a spell in Italy before blossoming at Sporting to secure his big moveIn a relatively small country, nothing stays a secret for too long. As Bruno Fernandes stepped outside his home and on to the street, he was swiftly doorstepped by a reporter from the television news station SIC. “It’s not the moment yet for my final message to Sporting fans,” he said with an amiable smile. Would he at least confirm that going to England was his preference? “It always was,” said Fernandes, without a second’s hesitation.All things come to those who wait and how Sporting Clube de Portugal’s captain waited. In the past year it was abundantly clear that Sporting couldn’t hold him much longer, and with his talent demanding a wider audience it would have been so even if they had been in better financial shape. So Sportinguistas savoured every moment over that period, from last April’s stealthy rocket from range to oust Benfica from the Taça de Portugal in the semi-final to the deflected drive that put them on the road to victory in the final against Porto.It has been a long goodbye more so this month, with the protracted negotiations between Sporting and Manchester United – who completed the £46m, five-and-a-half-year deal on Thursday, with the option of another year – leaving him in a strange sort of purgatory, having a farewell mini-tour in which each game looked like being his last. Fernandes’s reign at the Alvalade – and it was just that – finally ended with Monday’s narrow home win over Marítimo. Cristian Borja scored the winner but this Sporting victory had their No 8’s fingerprints all over it, as usual.Fernandes, 25, wore the armband, took the set pieces, drifted from centre to left to right as he made the passes, switched the play and pointed his teammates into position when he didn’t have the ball. He almost left one final sumptuous memory for those fans who adored him, smacking the crossbar with one of his frequent, sweetly struck efforts from range.A player not getting that elite club move (and United remain exactly that in the eyes of the vast majority of players outside England) until their mid-20s arouses the suspicions of some, and recalls a different time, which encompassed cases such as those of Gheorghe Hagi and Hristo Stoichkov. Although it is unusual to see top talent waiting far beyond 21 to be flogged to a top club in football’s modern economic climate, it does potentially offer Fernandes and United big advantages. He arrives with a much greater depth of experience than a player leaving Portugal for the Premier League would generally possess. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200130-57064-gnl.fw.20200130.jf.boooooo.mp3 Fernandes has rarely stood still. He has always had a strong sense of educating himself: after growing up on the outskirts of Porto and joining Boavista’s academy, he took the big decision to leave for Italy, and Novara, when he was 17, at an age when most players in his position would be dreaming of a future at Porto, Benfica or Sporting.It explains much of Fernandes’s wide palette now. His range of passing and ability to change the tempo are not typical of many goalscoring midfielders, but it is testament to the tactical schooling he received in Serie B and then in the top flight, with Udinese. Italy was also where he developed his steely side. Fernandes is hard working and difficult to bully, despite his relatively slight stature.After moving to Udine in 2013, he came under the influence of Antonio Di Natale, the club’s greatest-ever player. “Bruno Fernandes irritates me,” Di Natale once said, “because he’s young and out of the two of us he’s the one with more technical quality.“He’s got two incredible feet but sometimes he just coasts through games.” By the time he said that publicly, Di Natale had brought it up with Fernandes in private. He helped the young Portuguese work hard on his technique, and Fernandes acknowledges learning everything from striking the ball to better body shape from him.By the time Fernandes played an excellent season at Sampdoria in 2016-17, he had matured considerably and even though the €8.5 million Sporting paid for him after that was the second-highest fee in their history, it felt like a pretty safe bet.Let off the leash in the Sporting midfield with William Carvalho and Rodrigo Battaglia behind him, Fernandes came into his own in the attacking realm. He showcased his ability to score and assist, usually tucked in behind Bas Dost (the only player to cost Sporting more than Fernandes).That promising Sporting side fell apart when a group of ultras reacted furiously to their failure to reach the Champions League in 2018, invading the training base and attacking the players. Fernandes was one of nine to unilaterally rescind their contracts but agreed to come back – and made a point of signing the same terms as before, keen not to profit from the majority of the fans’ misery. Those supporters will miss him badly and if United get half of the productivity Sporting have been treated to, Fernandes will have gone a long way to remedying their midfield shortcomings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65f0ac36482825cd7db40610f437f9dc9df89a30/926_0_5389_3233/master/5389.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0aad19204b54d52f4169fe2229b7e4c","title":"cheikhou kouyate crystal palace africa cup of nations","story":"‘We don’t like that,” says Cheikhou Kouyaté, frowning. “But what can we do? They never listen to us players.” Having just completed a session at Crystal Palace’s training ground in Beckenham on a chilly January day, Senegal’s captain has a towel slung over his broad shoulders to keep out the cold.Less than 24 hours after the decision was taken to switch the 2021 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon from summer to the middle of next season, he wants to get something off his chest.Jürgen Klopp’s suggestion that the switch to January could put European clubs off signing African players struck a chord with Kouyaté, who was in the Senegal side also featuring Mané that lost to Algeria in the final of last year’s tournament in Egypt. “You could understand if that happened,” he says, nodding. “Managers need to have a strong squad that they can rely on all of the time.”Kouyaté should know. It is almost six years since he moved to the Premier League, having first tried his luck in Europe aged 17. Without a work permit and threatened with deportation from France, the midfielder was adopted by his Belgium-based agent before eventually being recruited by Anderlecht. But it was his performances for Senegal at the 2012 Olympics in London that proved to be the launchpad for him and many of his international teammates.“After the Olympics, so many players got contracts with big European clubs – it opened the doors for so many of our generation,” he says. “We’ve come a long way ... we’re from small towns with nothing there, no prospects. If you want to make it you need to fight as hard as possible.Kouyaté won four league titles with Anderlecht and was heavily linked with Arsenal before joining West Ham in 2014. He initially found the change of scenery hard to deal with.“In my first year here, every week I would want to go back to Belgium,” he says. “My friends were asking me why I kept coming back and I would tell them: ‘It’s because I don’t like London.’ But after three or four months I got to know some of the players at West Ham like Carlton Cole, Diafra Sakho and Mark Noble – he helped me a lot.”West Ham finished seventh in Kouyaté’s second season and he scored the first goal at the club’s new London Stadium home in a Europa League tie in August 2016. But his spell in east London soured in February 2018 when Tony Henry, the club’s head of player recruitment, was suspended following allegations that he wanted to limit the number of African players in their squad because some “have a bad attitude” and “cause mayhem” when they are not in the team.On the day the story broke, Kouyaté posted a selfie on Instagram with the caption: “African and proud” and now acknowledges the message was in direct response to what West Ham later condemned as “unacceptable comments” by an employee they sacked.“It was because we are so proud of where we are from,” he says. “We love football and we love having the chance to play in Europe. We don’t see any difference between white and black people. But sometimes we have some crazy people who I don’t understand why they say things … This is very hard for some brothers. For me, we just need to forget that and focus on our job.Palace’s longstanding interest in Kouyaté culminated in a £9.5m move in August 2018, allowing him to link up again with his former West Ham teammate James Tomkins. Despite the large African contingent in Roy Hodgson’s squad, Kouyaté insists that was not a factor in his decision.Senegal’s defeat in the Africa Cup of Nations final on 12 July – a “very bad moment”– meant Kouyaté had two weeks off before the new season. But his outstanding form has played a large part in Palace’s position four points off fifth place with just over a third of the campaign remaining. Kouyaté scored his first goal for the club in the win over West Ham on Boxing Day, although that was somewhat overshadowed by Ayew’s wonder-strike that was reminiscent of his father – the former Marseille and Ghana forward Abedi Pelé.“His father is the best one,” Kouyaté says. “Of all that generation … everyone knows him and everyone loves him. He is a legend. But it’s not easy if you have a famous dad – you have to be a good player otherwise it’s: ‘Pah, you are not as good as your father.’ The goal against West Ham, it was even better than his dad. Like Maradona.”As for whether Palace can improve on last season’s 12th place or surpass 2015’s Premier League high of 10th, Kouyaté is taking nothing for granted. “We have one objective: to finish higher than we did last year … But the first priority has to be make sure we are safe from relegation.”He also has big plans to try to emulate two of Senegal’s successful youth academies by opening his own once his career is over. Generation Foot and Diambars – established thanks to support from Dakar-born Patrick Vieira – have helped produce players such as Mané, Gueye and Watford’s Ismaïla Sarr over the past decade and Kouyaté believes it is only the start.“We need to continue this way because you can see how successful they have been. For me, it is a dream to do something like this in the future.

We have tracked him over a sustained period of time, he was a player we highlighted as someone who could come in and really improve us and we are thrilled he’s agreed to come here.

I think this signing just shows how far we have come in a short space of time, that we are now attracting the likes of Sander to the football club. It’s a brilliant signing for us.”Berge began his career playing youth football in Norway’s third tier and joined the top-flight club Valerenga in 2015. He made 36 appearances before moving to Genk on a four-year contract in January 2017.The holding midfielder played 98 times for Genk, scoring six goals, and played against Liverpool twice this season in the Champions League.His signing is one of three that Wilder hopes to complete before the transfer window closes on Friday night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5166bf220b4bfe926b0c32ba1a5eb175be302c/927_95_5974_3585/master/5974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e736801395b8a2298a0de13fae2aa95e","title":"tattoos and the armed forces in pictures","story":"Tribute Ink is a new exhibition featuring photographs by Charlie Clift at the National Army Museum, that explores how the military community uses tattoos.

As a reminder of the cap on human achievement, it’s up there with the ineluctable logic decreeing that ultimately Own Goal will end up being England’s top scorer. (Having previously topped the rankings, Own Goal is currently just behind Wayne Rooney. But don’t worry – it’ll have the top spot all to itself soon enough. No man can keep it down.)Alas, though, no matter how garlanded the Oscars are, the Academy is always seeking out new affectations and ways to congratulate itself. It remains extremely unclear why – certainly to viewers, who watch the event in smaller and smaller numbers each year. Last year, the Oscars telecast peaked at 29.6 million US viewers, although the zombie statistic that it is watched by “a billion people around the globe” staggers on. Indeed, it presumably accounts for all the winners’ attempts to contemplate Big Themes in their humble speeches, which serve as thankful outreach to all the citizens of the world who make them possible. The Congolese children, for instance, who watch the Oscars to unwind after a day down the cobalt mine surfacing the materials necessary for people to make memes on their phones about the red-carpet outfits. As a previous Oscars slogan ran: we ALL dream in gold.So, yes, the main reason the Academy has never really “got” comedy down the years is that it simply can’t afford to. Its vulnerability is just too great. It is much less personally exposing to stick to a metric where massive weight gain or weight loss is regarded as the highest form of acting. After all, this is an awards ceremony that wanks on annually about being audited by a top international accountancy firm, but which, in 2017, still somehow contrived to award its biggest prize to the wrong movie in an envelope snafu that even Shirley MacLaine was still “processing the horror of” three weeks later. Shirley’s processed about 47 past lives, to put that into the terrifying perspective it deserves.To quote Steven Seagal in Under Siege (1992, snubbed in all categories bar sound): what is this babbling bullshit? You don’t even think you owe your global membership the right to have their movies considered anywhere else than the ghetto of “best international feature film”. It feels fairly unlikely that you’re going to care about drowning their countries in order to produce enough energy to power the essential work of rebooting the Transformers franchise a few more times.So have we finally found it? Have we found the smallest commitment to doing anything other than jack shit that an organisation will publicly congratulate itself for? Did the Academy literally press release the fact that a single Oscar afterparty will be trimming the volume of meat that is served to people who are largely contractually mandated not to eat anything other than herb garnishes? It would seem so.Ideally, then, the notion of meat-based starters will be commemorated in the In Memoriam section of the interminable Oscars show, with a photo of Doris Day fading graciously into a picture of a doubtless witty take on lobster remoulade. We have lost so much. So much.Needless to say, this quarter-arsed gesture has been reported with admiration bordering on the clinical. Many publications have taken the time to point out that the Academy’s plan is likely to have been inspired by the Golden Globes’ own last-minute decision to go vegan earlier this month. That menu, we learn in remorseless detail, “originally featured a Chilean sea bass dish, but was changed to king oyster mushroom ‘scallops’ with wild mushroom risotto and vegetables”. Right. Is there an awful lot more of this? Oh, I see. There is. “Globes offerings also included a chilled golden beet soup appetizer,” one report elaborated. “A so-called ‘vegan opera dome’ by pastry chef Thomas Henzi was served as dessert …”Please don’t regard this as a so-called opera dome of bullshit. It’s quite the gesture-politics trend. In fact, the leading talent agency WME announced that its own pre-Oscars party would be plant-based in honour of its client Joaquin Phoenix. He stars in Joker, whose commitment to recycling other directors’ work was almost total.Indeed, Phoenix garnered headlines a few weeks ago when it was proudly revealed that he would be wearing the same dinner jacket for the whole awards season, a move that hugely endeared him to Stella McCartney, by chance also the designer of that dinner jacket. “This man is a winner,” explained McCartney on Twitter. “Wearing custom Stella because he chooses to make choices for the future of the planet. He has also chosen to wear the same Tux for the entire award season to reduce waste. I am proud to join forces with you.” When you say “join forces” … are there other forces? Stronger forces? Better strategised forces? I just feel like we need better forces on this stuff than people who capitalise Tux, or commit to wearing couture menswear more than once.It certainly wasn’t clear from Phoenix’s Globes acceptance speech, which began: “First, I would like to thank the Hollywood foreign press for recognising and acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change,” he said. “It’s a very bold move, making tonight plant-based.” It’s not the boldest, all told, but anyway. “We don’t have to take private jets to Palm Springs sometimes,” continued Phoenix, “or back, please.” Coupled with the historic announcement that the Golden Globes was going to reuse its red carpet rather than bin it as usual, this was a huge credit to an industry where, at any given moment, scores of luxury vehicles are ticking into the fourth hour of waiting with the air con on because a pretend superhero can’t get out of bed that day.So do let’s hope the Oscars goes several steps further and serves up another Hollywood night to make u think. Even if what you increasingly end up thinking is: I refuse to believe these people aren’t actually double agents for Exxon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60684842570c8a120aa6cddbad7909b0901a9511/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551bea1e5d941c2818161bdedcdfe140","title":"are you a woman who has experienced insolvency in later life","story":"If you have been insolvent over the age of 65, we would like to hear from youAccording to the government’s Insolvency Service, the number of personal insolvencies in England and Wales climbed to a nine-year high last year.We’d like to hear from women who have had to face insolvency.

Plus: Dan Sabbagh on Huawei’s role in British infrastructureFrom the moment Britain entered the European Economic Community in 1973, the question of how closely to align with other European countries has been a vexed one. Britain emphatically voted to remain in the club in a referendum in 1975 but throughout the 1980s the relationship began to fray. By the 2000s, Britain had opted to remain outside the single currency and support for the separatist UK Independence party was growing until David Cameron took the fateful decision to call a referendum on membership of what was then a 27-member European Union.

But there have also been increases in Germany and France, where there has been a tenfold rise in naturalisation of British citizens.In Spain, where dual nationality for British nationals is not a possibility, the numbers remain small but the rise since the referendum has also been sharp.Just over 32,000 citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain applied to receive Irish passports in 2015 for the first time. This has almost quadrupled in the last four years with figures for 2019 showing 131,817 new applications for Irish passports, with nearly 55,000 from GB alone.It means that between 2016 and 2020, nearly 360,000 people born in the UK have applied to acquire or renew an EU passport in nine of the countries that supplied data.The increase was dramatic, however, among those born in Great Britain who were applying for the first time for an Irish passport, rather than a renewal. The numbers rose from 7,372 in 2015 to 54,859 in 2019, according to data supplied for Ireland’s foreign affairs department.In Spain, where the greatest concentration of Britons living elsewhere in the EU is found, the numbers who have taken up citizenship are marginal. Of the estimated 600,000 British people who live there just 209 applied for a Spanish passport in 2018, the last year for which data is available, but this is compared with just 50 applications in 2015 and 33 in 2016.Although many thousands of Britons work in Brussels, the numbers for Belgium are also low. But they also show an upward trend since the referendum, with 1,403 naturalising in 2019 compared with 506 in 2016 and just 127 in 2015.In Sweden the number of passports granted to Britons between 2016 and 2019 rose from 942 to 4,267, while in Germany they rocketed from 622 in 2015 to 6,640 in 2018, with figures for 2019 expected to show another increase as two Brexit deadlines came and went.In France, where large numbers of British people live, the numbers are also relatively small but the pattern is the same: in 2015 just 320 Britons acquired French nationality in 2019 that had increased to 3,827, according to government data.The numbers in Italy have also grown steadily, with 266 applications in 2016 for an Italian passport rising to 731 the year after and 657 and 586 in 2018 and 2019.Data for Denmark and Finland also show increases in the past four years although numbers remain in the hundreds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea17a7aefe0ee7bbc5a3dc04bd68be7464a3dbec/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325413baadf7541f4d784c064535a2f7","title":"can my pet travel with me after 31 january readers ask about post brexit rights","story":"Which passport should my children use? Will I pay home or EU student fees? Your questions answeredThere is continuing confusion about citizens’ rights after Brexit. We asked you about your concerns, and many wrote in with questions about pension and healthcare rights.You raised other issues too: can I still sail around Europe? Will I pay home fees if I start university in the Netherlands this year? What will happen about my pet’s passport? There is much unfinished Brexit business, as you will see from our answers below, composed with the help of experts and government departments.My children are fortunate enough to have UK and EU passports as their mother is an EU citizen. When booking flights and travelling to visit family in the EU, which passport should we use? I’m concerned if they travel to the UK on their EU passport, they’ll be penalised as not having settled status, and be penalised flying into the EU on a UK passport.Social care worker, WarwickshireYou can use either passport as immigration rules remain exactly the same for the next 11 months. There is no requirement for any EU citizen to present evidence of settled status to anyone as free movement applies until 31 December under the legally binding withdrawal agreement. What happens after that remains to be determined.I am a medical doctor from Madrid, Spain, doing a short clinical fellowship in oncology at the Royal Marsden hospital. I am in London for three months but have to make a trip to Madrid before I complete my last month. Will I have any problems? Do I need my passport or any additional documentation?Spanish citizen, LondonNo extra documents are needed but passports and ID cards will be required as usual on entering the country. The UK remains in the single market until 31 December and EU rules on free movement will continue to apply until next year. So EU citizens are free to study, work or retire in the UK for the next 11 months.As a dual national, will I get into enormous trouble if I return to the UK on my Polish passport after 31 January without having my British one? It’s obviously a fairly avoidable situation but I’d kind of like to know how much trouble it could cause, or whether I would in fact be fine travelling on my EU passport still.Andrzej Lukowski, journalistNo. Your Polish passport will suffice until 31 December as freedom of movement still applies (see previous answers). If anyone asks you for any extra evidence, you’ll have yourself a news story.My transatlantic lifestyle means travel via Dublin or Heathrow, and Belfast. Fair enough, I have to cope, as a UK citizen. But my pet dog follows separately, on a EU-wide pet passport. My fear is that her travel (flights usually Washington-Frankfurt-Dublin, thence by car to Northern Ireland, or vice-versa) will be utterly imperilled. I cannot find advice from our pet couriers. This may not be important to you, but my heart could soon be broken by post-Brexit regulations.Nick Brannon, retired archaeologistNothing will change for your pet before the end of the transition period on 31 December, but what happens afterwards depends on what is negotiated in the next 11 months. At present, dogs, cats and ferrets can travel freely across the EU on an EU pet passport, under the EU pet travel scheme.From next year, what they will need in the way of extra certificates and vaccinations will depend on whether the EU declares the UK a “part 1 listed third country” for pet travel purposes, a “part 2 listed third country” or an “unlisted third country”.Vets are hopeful the UK will gain part 1 status, which would require your pet to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies 21 days before travel, and to hold a UK pet passport. A dozen non-EU European countries have this status.Many more, including the US, are part 2 listed, meaning pets need extra treatments (against tapeworm, for example) plus a vet’s certificate every time they travel. They must also enter the EU at a designated entry point.The conditions for pets from unlisted countries are even stricter. A worst-case scenario could result in owners having to pay considerable sums for extra vaccinations, treatments and certification every time their pets travel, and having to start the process up to four months beforehand.

While I see warnings about customs changes for companies that import or export goods, not even the staff at the government’s business Brexit helpline know what implications there are for businesses providing services to European clients. Our European clients ask me what will happen to the services we provide after Brexit and I have to tell them I have no idea. David, south-east EnglandI am a UK citizen living in England and currently receive a German state pension. I worked in West Germany in the 1970s. Will Brexit change this pension and the way I receive it?C, DorsetYour pension from Germany will continue to be paid as it is now under the withdrawal agreement. The threat of it changing was linked to a no-deal Brexit but it is protected for life under the withdrawal agreement. I am 73, retired and Danish and live in Edinburgh. I receive a smattering of state pensions from Denmark, the UK and Luxembourg as well as a small pension from the EU commission. I worry that the transfer of the various pensions will be more expensive. Do you think I am right to worry?L, EdinburghYour right to receive your aggregated pension is guaranteed under the withdrawal agreement and there is no reason that would change.I applied for university in the Netherlands, to start in September. I still don’t know whether I’ll be paying EU fees or not, and they don’t either. It would be good to know soon because I can’t afford to go if I have to pay non-EU fees.17-year-old student, London (name supplied)Those who start a course before the end of the transition period will still benefit from the reciprocal home fees arrangements among EU states. A spokesman for the Dutch government confirmed UK students starting courses this September would pay home fees – currently €2,043 (£1,722) a year – for the course’s duration, provided they remain living and registered in the Netherlands.I’m concerned that while I am currently a European Union citizen, with the right to work and live anywhere in the union, with access to justice and healthcare anywhere in the union, I’m now going to lose that. Michael Wooley, retired teacher, ChichesterFrom 1 February, British citizens who do not have dual nationality with another EU state are no longer European Union citizens. However, for the next 11 months, British citizens retain the free movement rights to study, work and retire in the EU.My French girlfriend works as a lecturer in France, teaching a few days a week, and regularly commutes between there and the UK. Post-Brexit, how will this work? She doesn’t work here or reside permanently for settled status.J, ManchesterAs she is an EU citizen she can study, work and retire in France, without any questions or extra paperwork, for life. The issue will be coming back into the UK after next year. If she is just visiting she may be fine on tourist access conditions for that have not yet been defined. But if she intends to remain living here, she will be required to demonstrate that she was resident here before Brexit fully happened on 31 December. The government has opened what is called the EU settlement scheme (EUSS), a special immigration category for EU citizens. There is a phone app and the process should be very straightforward. More than 2 million people have already successfully applied for settled status. EU citizens have up to 30 June next year to apply for EUSS but the Home Office is encouraging people to apply before the end of this year to reduce the risk of any difficulties with border control next year.As a retired British citizen living in the EU, I’m very worried about both my healthcare provision and UK state pension after Brexit. I’ve heard so many different versions. What is the situation exactly – should I be concerned?Susan Templeton, FranceThere is a lot of confusion about this: people still have in mind the rules that would have applied in the case of a no-deal exit. The rules for both healthcare and pensions are clearly set out in the withdrawal agreement, a legally binding international treaty.If you have an S1 reciprocal healthcare form (mainly applies to UK pensioners settled in the EU before 31 December), the UK will continue to meet the healthcare costs of you and your family as long as you remain legally resident in your host country, without time limit.An S1 form will also entitle you to a UK EHIC card for treatment when travelling within the EU, and UK law in any case entitles you to free treatment in Britain. Of course, if you are working in your host country and paying into its social security system, you will continue to be covered for healthcare there as before.The withdrawal agreement also states that UK state pensions, and all other UK benefits that may be paid to non-residents, will continue to be uprated annually, as if you were still living in the UK. This arrangement is also without time limit, contrary to the no-deal plans which no longer apply. Full details are here.I was born in Cork, Ireland, and have an Irish passport. I’ve lived in England for the past 61 years, since I was six months old. What are the arrangements for Irish passport holders and am I able to remain indefinitely in the UK?M, West Yorkshire.Irish passport holders are treated separately to the rest of EU citizens under the withdrawal agreement. This is partly because of the common travel area but also because of efforts by the British and Irish governments to ensure reciprocity of rights continues. So you have the right to remain indefinitely in the UK, and to work, study, vote, retire and travel between the UK and Ireland freely.I own a house in Spain. I bought the house with the intention of retiring there in a few years. What provisions will be made for the many thousands of people in my position?G, north-east EnglandIf you retire to an EU country before the end of the year, you will retain all the rights you currently have, apart from freedom of movement. If you are eligible for a pension or UK-funded healthcare (known as S1), you will retain these rights for life. What you will lose, as it currently stands, are the rights to study, work or retire in another member state. Britons in Europe are campaigning for this right to be granted in the next stage of negotiations, along with the right to return back to the UK with a EU family member, and the right for your children to pay home fees at a British university.This article might be of some interest as it features someone of a similar age (50s) who has just moved to Spain.The French and British government websites give little practical – and some contradictory – guidance about applying for a residence permit. The British government site refers to the French for definitive information. But in many places on their official site, the French authorities state that you will only need to apply for a permit if there is no withdrawal deal. Clearly, there is an agreement, but one only covering the transition period. So, we are in limbo until at least December 2020. How do we plan for retirement, move house, and continue to work when in such intolerable uncertainty?Robin Williams, Savoie, FranceAs a Briton legally resident in France, you are right that nothing will change during the transition period. After that, you will need to apply for a residency permit before June 2021, assuming the transition is not extended or France opts, as it may do under the withdrawal agreement, to extend its administrative deadline itself.It isn’t yet clear how you should apply, so it is probably best to wait until that becomes clear, presumably within the next few months.Until very recently France has focused on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and its online application process for post-Brexit residency applications has not yet been updated. We do not know if it will be, or if the government will revert to the old system via local authorities.The permit itself is in any case likely to be a special one for post-Brexit British residents its design is not yet known. What is clear, however, is that when you do apply for it you’ll need to show you are legally resident – either in a job, retired, self-employed, a student or self-supporting.If you have been legally resident in France for at least five years, you can apply directly for permanent residency. Otherwise, you will be applying for temporary residency, which you can upgrade later.I am an army veteran who was medically discharged in 2016 with PTSD after 40 years’ service.

After that, freedom of movement is unlikely to apply although campaigners are hoping it will apply to a particular group of British nationals who are already fully resident in an EU member state.On the customs aspect, we asked the Royal Yacht Association, which said: “The ability for recreational boats together with their equipment and other contents to navigate free of customs procedures and time limits throughout the waters of the European Union is currently dependent on them having customs status of union goods.“In order for a boat to have union status the VAT must be accounted for and if the boat has been imported any applicable customs duty must also have been paid. The owner is then able to move the boat freely through the EU without being subject to a customs procedure, from one point to another within the customs territory of the union, and temporarily out of that territory by sea without alteration of their customs status provided that their union status is proven.“During the transition period the UK and the EU will finalise the UK’s future relationship with the EU and it is only once those negotiations have been concluded that we will know the implications of the end of the transition period and any steps that recreational boaters need to take if they wish to retain union status.”Q. I have a Greek residence permit and spend about six months each year in Greece, in a house which I rent all year. I do not have Greek citizenship and will never be able to apply for this (it requires a proficiency in the language which I despair of ever attaining). I and many friends would be very grateful to have some clarity on this issue. My residence permit was issued in August 2019 on the basis of the EHIC card as proof of health insurance. The residence permit is not time limited but the EHIC card may be, so this is another concern for many of us. Anne, SurreyBritish citizens will no longer be EU citizens as of 11pm on 31 January. However, freedom of movement rights remain in place until the end of the year while the UK remains part of the single market from where these rights flow. This means you are free to move to and from Greece as before, no questions asked, for the remainder of the year.If you have permanent residency before the end of this year, you will retain your rights to study, work and retire in that member state for the rest of your life. However, permanent residency is usually based on being in a country for more than six months of a year and you may find yourself classified as a tourist, with normal immigration rules applying after 2020. Britons in Europe who have been campaigning for their rights complain that no countries in the EU, apart from the UK and Ireland, have yet said how they are going to deal with British nationals who retain the right to live there.

We were never just ‘tolerating’ EU citizens living in this country.“They are our neighbours and friends and families. To see their status in doubt devastates not just our sense of justice but of fellowship.”His intervention 24 hours before Britain leaves the EU is likely to appeal to remain supporters, who make up the bulk of the Labour party membership. He has been criticised previously for having been the joint-architect of Labour’s Brexit policy, which has been cited as a major factor in their catastrophic defeat in December .Starmer argued for a second referendum and has faced criticism from those who fear he is not well-placed to win back the leave supporters whovoted Tory at the 2019 election.Stephen Barclay, theBrexit secretary , is due to return to the backbenches after the Whitehall Brexit department is dissolved, which makes Starmer’s role unclear.Starmer also wrote that after Brexit , the leave-remain ide affecting the country must come to an end. He said: “Defining people by how they voted in June 2016 merely upholds a ide that we must overcome. There are no leavers or remainers anymore. In 2024 there will no leave seats or remain constituencies.”He will also call for the Labour party to move on from the Brexit debate too, saying: “I will move our party on from the ision of the past and remake our party as a democratic movement that faces outwards towards the country not inwards on itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ac11a9490b21548775dbdab9584c724ec0ce5b/0_84_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14aa73021f7b7984bc8a0ca0dc0a5315","title":"sub dom shrinks in the face of big mikes stage managed bantz","story":"Forget Huawei. And Brexit. A new special relationship has dawned – just don’t ask too many questionsNot so much a conversation, more a therapeutic intervention for two men with massive anger management issues. A public mediation session where Dominic Raab and his US counterpart, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, were challenged to go a full 40 minutes without losing their temper, abusing one another or deflecting blame. A chance to listen without passing judgment, and to break the habits of a lifetime by accepting some personal responsibility. However difficult and insincere that might be. Fake it to make it and all that. It was all most irregular, though highly effective. The day that Dom became Sub.You’d have thought that what with the UK’s decision to grant Huawei access to its 5G infrastructure and the US going rogue both on Iran and a one-sided Middle East peace deal that didn’t involve the Palestinians, there might have been a little tension in the talks between Raab and Pompeo. But in the capable, Mogadon hands of Dean Godson, director of the thinktank Policy Exchange, neither man said a word out of place. Indeed they barely completed a sentence through which anyone – themselves included – could stay awake. As though the whole event had been deliberately designed to be as dull as possible.Godson opened up with a gentle lob on Brexit. How was it going? It was going just great, said Raab, gripping his chair nervously as he waited for the full effects of his anti-psychotic medication to take effect. Brexit would fill Britain with self-confidence and ambition. The “can do” spirit.Weirdly, now that Brexit has become a reality, Raab appears to have become more and more submissive. All his usual swagger and aggression has dissipated and he has become more hesitant and less self-assured now that he is fully accountable for his actions. Perhaps he is worried he might get reshuffled. He looked up needily towards Pompeo, desperate for some affirmation. Big Mike – the proper Dom, the man with the real power in the relationship – duly obliged. Everything was going to be just fine. The US loved democracy – apart from the impeachmenty bits – and the UK would be first in line for any trade deal.Pompeo went on to mumble something about how when he had previously said that a UK deal with Huawei would put the mockers on any trade agreement with the US he had only been joshing. Hey, if you couldn’t have some bantz with your friends, who could you have it with? I mean, sometimes things got a bit out of hand and people slept with each others’ partners, but nothing that couldn’t be resolved over a cold beer and a trade war. Or a military one, come to that.Yes, nodded Sub Dom. That was it. We shared so much. We were best friends, weren’t we? Best Friends Forever. He would never have dreamed of doing anything to upset the US. And to prove he really meant that, he wanted it totally on record that he was totally cool with whatever Big Mike wanted to do in Iran. He completely accepted that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was not as effective as it might have been and if the US wanted to unilaterally come up with an entirely different proposal, then he was all ears.Only once did Dom Mike threaten to go off script. That was when he lapsed into a second mini rant about Huawei and the Chinese government. Letting Huawei into your 5G network wasn’t opening a back door to the Commie bastards. It was opening the front door. So the US would have to think real hard about what levels of intelligence it was going to share with any country dumb enough to do something like that. But luckily, Godson manage to retrieve the situation and to bring the discussion back to the entirely anodyne.“OK, we’re going to take a few questions now,” said Godson. But could everyone bear in mind that Dom Mike and Sub Dom were in very early recovery and their relationship was still extremely fragile? So if everyone could steer clear of Israel and any more tricky questions about trade deals, he would be much obliged. Besides, hadn’t both men already made clear how absolutely brilliant everything was going to be from now on? So perhaps people could ask them about their favourite violent video games instead?By now, everyone in the audience was too comatose to argue. They just wanted the whole thing to end. There was only so much saccharine, stage-managed public displays of affection anyone could take. Though one journalist did ask whether the two men would consider swapping Prince Andrew for Anne Sacoolas. We’d hand over a royal friend to a sex abuser and the US would give us a hit and run driver. It promised to be an interesting line in philosophical diplomacy. Which country would claim Jennifer Arcuri? And what would you get in return for a Nigel Farage and an Anne Widdecombe?But this was all getting far too out of control for Godson, so he rapidly brought the event to a close. It had all gone near enough perfectly with Dom and Sub taking their first baby steps together in public. He still didn’t have much confidence in both men. Hell, they hadn’t even begun to get near any of the really tricky stuff. But if there was to be a falling out, it could happen later. Behind closed doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94b8d294b86c19908253c675c147f504355f1d35/414_684_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7065aaa60cb0efc07f2ff9aa10190a1","title":"the ins and outs of brexit in pictures","story":"On 31 January, the UK will finally leave the European Union after years of tense negotiations, resignations and a controversial prorogation.

I was 5mph off where I wanted to be in New Zealand but it was nicer when I moved to the red-ball part of the tour and a fresh set of eyes in Goughie picked up a couple of things pretty quickly.“I felt out of rhythm and couldn’t work out what it was. But he spotted it straight away, something to do with my run-up. As soon as I put that back into my training I felt good again and thought: ‘God, I wish someone had told me this two weeks ago.’“Exposure to high-pressure situations can do things – you start to try harder and that can have a backwards effect. Having been through that and had time to reflect, it’s now: ‘Right, do this next time.’”Gough’s assistance went beyond this technical tweak, as the former bowler, who played for England from 1994 to 2006, also shared his in-depth knowledge of reverse swing. Mahmood had already built a reputation for getting sideways movement with the old ball on the county circuit yet was still blown away by the advice handed down.Mahmood said: “I get reverse when I bowl but I wouldn’t know how best to go about it before I worked with Goughie. He told me how much he practised it, which I was nowhere near.“When you’re trying to reverse a ball back into a right-hander your mind is telling you to push the ball. But you don’t want to do that. As easy as it sounds, it does take a while to get used to it. By the back end of the trip I was doing 10 balls at the end of every session and I got pretty good.“After that it was: ‘I can’t wait to get a ball in my hand and do this in a game’ so I’m effective from ball one of my spell, rather than getting a feel for it by my second over. I made good strides.”As well as learning how to get reverse swing sooner by consistently landing the old ball on one side of the seam, Mahmood picked up a leg-cutter from working alongside Stuart Broad and spent the two Tests as an unused squad member studiously noting the Kiwi attack’s tactics on two flat pitches.While still learning his trade in first-class cricket, Mahmood’s call-up for the three-match ODI series against South Africa that begins next week – the warm-ups for which take place in Paarl on Friday and Saturday – is reward for finishing as the leading wicket-taker in last year’s Royal London Cup with 28 dismissals.So too is the England development contract he received this week along with Warwickshire’s Olly Stone and Craig Overton of Somerset. The trio will have a chunk of their county contracts paid for by the national team in exchange for their workloads being managed centrally.England’s desire to build a stable of fast bowlers before the 2021-22 Ashes series is obvious and after the South Africa tour comes another important trip for Mahmood when he flies out to join the first-class leg of the Lions trip to Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b4e9525bb998191d44cdf544fce7cffd640582/0_171_2554_1532/master/2554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b560ab8f48bf665358972cc4cf54f9","title":"kobe vanessa bryant gianna on horrific loss","story":"Basketball superstar’s widow posts about devastation of losing husband and daughterThree days after the Los Angeles basketball great Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others died in a helicopter crash, his wife, Vanessa, has spoken for the first time, saying on Instagram she was completely devastated by their loss.The message was posted alongside a recent family photograph of Kobe and Vanessa Bryant with their four daughters: Gianna, Natalia, 17, three-year-old Bianka and Capri, born in June 2019.Kobe Bryant and the couple’s second daughter, nicknamed Gigi, died on Sunday when the helicopter in which they were flying crashed in foggy weather on a hillside north-west of Los Angeles. They were on their way to the Mamba Sports Academy for a girls’ basketball tournament.Gianna was a member of the Mamba team which was due to compete that day. Her father, who retired from the National Basketball Association in 2016 after 20 years with the Los Angeles Lakers, was the team’s coach.The pilot and six other passengers were also killed, including two 13-year-old girls also involved in the tournament, three of their parents and another coach. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.The death of Bryant, 41, an 18-time NBA All-Star, a five-time Lakers champion and one of the world’s most admired sports figures, unleashed an outpouring of grief and tributes from fans, athletes and politicians around the world.“My girls and I want to thank the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time,” wrote Vanessa Bryant, 37, a former model, on her Instagram account.“We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe – the amazing father of our children and my beautiful, sweet Gianna – a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri.”The message continues: “We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now.“I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon.”She directed anyone wishing to “further Kobe and Gianna’s legacy in youth sports” to visit the Mamba Sports Foundation site. There has been no word yet on funeral arrangements.

To him, 38 probably does not feel much different to 36, when he won his 20th grand slam title here. “You never know what the future holds,” he said. “But especially my age, you don’t know. I’m confident. I’m happy how I’m feeling, to be honest. I got through a good, nice training block. No plans to retire. From that standpoint we’ll see how the year goes, how everything is with the family. We’ll go from there. Of course, I hope to be back.”But playing in pain is no fun. Having pushed his body to the limit in beating John Millman in a final-set tie‑break in the third round and then picking up the injury against Tennys Sandgren in the quarter-finals, Federer was determined to play, even though he had agreed with his team that if the injury worsened he would stop – something he has never done in his career. Entering his 50th meeting with Djokovic with very little chance of winning was a difficult pill to swallow.Federer’s other regret on the night was not being able to close out the first set, having led 4-1, and 0-40 on the Djokovic serve as the Serb, seven times the champion here, found himself trying to gauge the level of Federer’s fitness rather than focusing on his own game.At 5-3, he could not serve out the set and Djokovic took the tie‑break, before pulling away to set up a final against Dominic Thiem or Alexander Zverev.“I was playing with nothing to lose,” he said. “I was just trying to take big cuts at the ball, trying to keep the rallies to a minimum, make sure I keep him off guard, mix it up as much as I can. “I returned really well in the beginning. Got some really good connections going. Unfortunately I was not able to serve it out. To be honest, I feel like I should have found a way to do that, but wasn’t able to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb122abc508405a3218e1a19551d717a1f1992e/314_590_4553_2733/master/4553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ac16332e1bbc89f74c7c740ea0dfa3a","title":"six nations championship preview europe differences new coaches","story":"These are changing times – politically, environmentally, societally – but some things remain resolutely the same. Come rain or shine, for richer or poorer, the Six Nations retains its prominent place in the sporting calendar, not just the perfect vehicle to help navigate through winter into spring but an annual reminder that Britain and Europe still have plenty in common.Regardless of everyone’s EU membership status, the start of a new championship season is an antidote to most woes: a feelgood milestone offering the chance to make a point on the field and raise a glass to shared friendships off it. The day rugby loses its fond tradition of cross-border camaraderie and the Six Nations is reduced to also-ran status it might as well pack up its old kitbag.For now, as Eddie Jones reiterated in his recent autobiography, it remains “the greatest annual tournament” in rugby. “In my experience, nothing comes even remotely close to it,” said Jones, who has spent enough time in the southern hemisphere to know his subject well. Whether it is the pilgrimages made by the travelling fans, the evocative backdrops, the ancient rivalries or the overflowing passion during the anthems, it still seems to capture the imaginations of all ages.There is, however, one significant difference this year. The investment plans of the private equity firm CVC are due to be formally confirmed in March, heralding a new era that may or may not prove game‑breaking. Rather than preaching mostly to the converted, the Six Nations will shortly be reaching out to a whole new audience at a delicate time in the sport’s history. Sell itself successfully as the Greatest Show on Turf and its future will be assured indefinitely. Kill the golden goose of northern hemisphere rugby and history will not be kind to those concerned.Happily, we have not yet reached the stage where no one cares and the outcome is a foregone conclusion. In the 20 years since the Five Nations was expanded by the addition of Italy the statistics are fascinating. England have won the title six times but have claimed “only” two grand slams, in 2003 and 2016. How many would have predicted in 2000 that Wales would win as many slams as England and Ireland combined over the next two decades or that France would go a full 10 years from 2010 without a single title?If Scotland and Italy have largely wallowed around in the bottom half during that period, it is still within their gift to shape the tournament in some way or another. Those anticipating a comfortable romp this spring for England, for example, are overlooking the fact Scotland are unbeaten against them since 2017. Italy, under the new management of Franco Smith, will have Scotland very much in their sights when they host them in Rome next month.There is no hiding from the reality, though, that a trio of games in particular will determine this season’s top three. France v England on Sunday is the first one, with Ireland’s trips to Twickenham and Paris potentially the others. If France get it right first time under the unlikely duo of Fabien Galthié and Shaun Edwards, everyone will be catapulted into a crazy seven weeks of myriad possibilities. If, on the other hand, no one beats England in their opening three matches this month, the World Cup finalists will be short odds to complete the second grand slam of the Jones era.It all boils down to one big intangible: will England, having expended so much physical and mental energy in Japan, be able to reboot themselves psychologically against a series of opponents under fresh management? Human nature would suggest that, in addition to France, Ireland under Andy Farrell and Wales under Wayne Pivac will be bright-eyed and eager to impress. That does not always translate into instant results but history suggests that, in a post-World Cup tournament, it is not necessarily the obvious teams who prosper.That there has been a grand slam achieved in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 – by three different nations – bodes well for anyone who can start strongly. Will the Saracens saga affect England in any way? Not so much, one suspects, as the Finn Russell affair will affect Scotland and the absence of Jonathan Davies will hamper Wales.This is not a tournament lacking power runners well equipped to exploit backline weakness. If Virimi Vakatawa stays fit the France midfield will be a proper handful, while it will be a surprise if Farrell’s Ireland are as flat and anonymous as they ultimately were in Japan.By the final whistle in Paris on Sunday it should also be clear whether or not England’s World Cup final underachievement has had a galvanising effect. There is also the small matter of how swiftly Matt Proudfoot and Simon Amor bed in as assistant coaches. As one or two of their predecessors have discovered, Jones’s patience stretches only so far.If we are lucky, too, this will be a tournament illuminated by bright young things – Caelan Doris, Louis Rees-Zammit, Romain Ntamack, Rory Hutchinson, Ben Earl.Defence, either way, will be as vital as ever.

What is the best advice to give them about specifications etc, bearing in mind their finite budgets?A user who wants a desktop PC to deal with email and social media, office files, surfing the web and streaming some video will also need to buy peripherals, including a monitor. Some will need a printer. Often the advice will be to get the best PC possible, but they may not get the full benefit if other parts of the system are too compromised. DavidAlmost every PC on the market will perform basic tasks such as writing emails and browsing the web. Even cheap laptops can run Microsoft Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today’s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.Any PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.Either way, it’s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.I don’t want to repeat last week’s description of the desktop’s advantages over laptops in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the CPU is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.Short of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it’s done.Second hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges.You may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware. You will probably have to collect it, and you may be offered quite a lot of junk. However, people can develop hardware skills on junk PCs, and extract parts to sell on eBay. If not, securely wiping hard drives and recycling old PCs is still a useful social function.Thanks to two long-term trends, most PC buyers can now afford a system that will run Microsoft Windows 10 reasonably well. First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, Windows 10 usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.But the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for Windows and 2GB for browser tabs.When a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the Disk Clean-up app (remember to click “Clean up system files”) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.Today, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or Linux Mint is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and “power users” will want, and often need, more.Picking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)No one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it’s using without looking it up. Often, differences don’t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.Businesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It’s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it’s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don’t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn’t care. If you’re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won’t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.There’s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of “normal”.So, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.The good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today’s standards. In response to the market’s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more performance per watt, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a TDP of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.There are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip’s score on the PassMark benchmark and compare it with your own PC’s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don’t matter.)For a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.In general, you should be looking at Intel Core chips in the ex-corporate refurbished market, and Core i5 versions are often the best value. If you’re buying new, aim for the highest spec you can justify. Intel Core chips are still very good but the AMD Ryzen equivalents may be better value.Have you got a question?

In this opening episode of the 10th season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, belated felicitations join soft scones, wobbly tables and human bowls borrowed by dogs as the latest prompts for Larry David’s raging misanthropy. With characteristic cleverness, though, each of these minor irritants transitions into a crucial plot device with astonishing agility. After a two-year absence, this is a strong, confident and very funny return for the Seinfeld co-creator.Some fans thought season nine was underrated, but I felt it lacked the vitality of the best of Curb – occasionally, watching it could be a bit of an endurance sport.  described its slapstick as “fourth-rate Benny Hill”, Vulture said it felt “like a throwback in a bad way”. It got better as it went along, but pegging the whole season to Larry writing a musical comedy about the fatwa on Salman Rushdie, which turned into him dealing with a fatwa of his own, felt like a stretch – even if Hamilton’s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, did arrive to brighten everything up.For season 10, Curb appears to have gone for a back-to-basics reset. The show has been on the air for 20 years, and despite sometimes branching out into more high-concept ideas, it is often at its finest when it simply does what it does and does it well: Larry is a terrible person, and then everything goes wrong. In the hands of a lesser show, the fact that he never learns from his mistakes would be repetitive, but Curb rewards viewers for their masochism.Mocha Joe, last seen in the season seven finale, is back and Larry finds his new coffee shop to be lacking. The coffee is too cold, the tables are wonky and, worse, the scones are soft. “I’m not quite sure you know what a scone is, Mocha Joe,” he complains, though as a British viewer, watching him stuff what appears to be a flat cake into his mouth with no butter, cream or jam on it makes me wonder if he does, either. His fury at the cold coffee leads to a half-hearted boycott of the shop, followed by all-out war.This was the funniest episode of Curb I have seen in a long time, not just clever-funny, but laugh-out-loud, total idiocy funny. Larry’s “big goodbye” technique, an over-the-top farewell designed to disguise the fact that he has been avoiding the recipient of it all night, fails to work on Phil Rosenthal, who has seen it all before. So Larry goes nuclear, and procures a red Maga cap. In the fanciest parts of Los Angeles, it is a people-repellent, much to Larry’s delight and convenience.But it may backfire on him. It takes some skill to craft a running #MeToo gag predicated on the fact that women have misunderstood the situation, but here we are. Jeff complains that he is constantly being mistaken for Harvey Weinstein (the resemblance is certainly there, and it turns him into the human equivalent of the Maga cap). Larry is accused of ogling a waitress when he has been, in fact, ogling a tray of pigs in blankets. Curb has largely avoided being sucked into cancel culture and public shaming before now, but its world is a world of celebrities, so it’s hard to see how it could have avoided it.With the Mocha Joe feud, the Cheryl dilemma (Larry and his ex-wife share a moment at Susie’s party that blossoms into something more) and the #MeToo subplot, this is vintage Curb, weighed down by nothing but the need to be furiously funny. As Cheryl tells Larry, not without affection: “You’re such an asshole.” Would we have it any other way?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d12a008a0591a66f8046ad1e11aee55c85b9ff3/32_349_1115_669/master/1115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74800f5a14afb9478bb3f376c0602046","title":"the secret of life of us broke the mould with its honest depiction of twentysomething culture","story":"Followed by Love My Way and Tangle, the series was first in a triptych of Australian dramas that made a whole generation feel seen and heard• What’s your most unforgettable Australian TV moment? Vote in our pollLife in my 20s was a whirlwind of McJobs, casual sex, insane crushes, share houses, and intense friendships. I was trying to start a career, trying to write the great Australian novel, always poor, making bad choices while drunk, and somehow had hours and hours in the middle of the day, in the middle of the week, to just … hang out.It was unremarkable, but it felt somehow hidden. We were living these lives in inner-Melbourne that felt complicated and interesting and full of drama, yet strangely, we never really saw these types of (let’s face it, pretty privileged) lives in the TV shows we watched.Instead, people in their 20s in Australia at the turn of the millennium watched Melrose Place or Friends to see their generation reflected back at them. But the reflection never seemed quite right. Those shows were too glossy, the apartments too nice, the characters too well put together, their problems not really relatable. There was the BBC drama This Life, about a bunch of London barristers, that came close – it was full of fully realised characters whose messy, complicated lives seemed human in a way that the characters on American dramas were not. Later, Fleabag and Girls covered similar ground well. But for a long time in Australia, the lives of urban 20-somethings were passed over in favour of cop shows, dramas focused on communities in the bush or by the sea, or the lives of suburban families in soaps such as Neighbours.That is, until The Secret Life of Us.Premiering in 2001 on Channel 10, even the opening credits (backed by a Motor Ace song) provoked a thrill of recognition. There was St Kilda beach! And a neon-lit bar! And a tram!Secret Life of Us followed the relationships of a group of twentysomething Melbourne friends, played by Deborah Mailman, Claudia Karvan and Samuel Johnson. Kelly, Alex and Evan were the housemates that seemed eerily familiar – starting careers, trying to write books, losing jobs, sleeping with the wrong people.The show was the first in a triptych of excellent Australian dramas produced by John Edwards that tapped into the sensibility of a generation. It was followed by the thirtysomething drama, Love My Way, and Tangle, which focused on fortysomethings. They were distinct, unrelated storylines, but the cast and creative team overlapped, and all three were distinguished by their superior scripts, a keen eye for location, excellent cinematography and talented casts.In lesser-hands, The Secret Life of Us could have easily been embarrassing or tone deaf – always a problem when people try to make edgy, youth-focused drama. But it aired for four seasons on free-to-air television and reflected a very contemporary Australia.Love My Way, airing a few years later on pay TV, was its more complex, richer and ultimately more satisfying older sibling, focusing on complex family structures, both traditional and patched together, of a group of thirtysomethings in Sydney. Karvan also co-produced and wrote much of the series, describing it as “rawer and darker” than its predecessor. Love My Way also contained some of the best Australian acting talent ever assembled – Karvan, Sam Worthington, Dan Wyllie, Asher Keddie, Brendan Cowell, Lynette Curran and Max Cullen – and it looked beautiful and sounded real. (Although the first episode, in which Karvan’s character gets drunk at the Walkley awards and goes home with an ill-chosen colleague, was perhaps more real for some of us than others.)The third in the triptych, Tangle, brought the action back to Melbourne and focused on fortysomething adults and their teen children. It lasted for three seasons, starring Justine Clarke, Catherine McClements, Ben Mendelsohn, Kat Stewart and Matt Day. Frequently described by critics as “dark” and “noirish”, once again the emphasis was on relationships, with strong writing, a top-shelf cast and memorable cinematography elevating it above others.Tangle found its fan base, but it never quite captured the zeitgeist like The Secret Life of Us. That show has now shifted to 7Plus, and holds up well even two decades later. Many of the young leads – fresh faces at the time – are now Australian acting royalty. And the stories of finding your place in the world and working out what you want to do and who you want to be with, are universal – albeit with local flavour.There is nostalgia too, for the pre-iPhone age. None of the characters sat scrolling through apps to find “the one”. Instead, sex, love and friendship was found in share houses or at work or in the bar. The mobile phones were massive, flatmates found through advertisements in the paper, and you got directions by carting around the Melways.The show immediately became a classic, becoming wildly popular and netting critical acclaim. I remember DVD box sets being passed around groups of friends, many of whom still describe it as one of the best Australian shows ever made. That’s what I think, too. The Secret Life of Us showed us a side of ourselves we hadn’t seen much on the small screen before, and helped remind us that maybe our messy, complicated, unconventional lives and loves were OK after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74b6252f19e850213fe5265f87bf52c32ad6f441/145_266_1135_681/master/1135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eec9e91700865daef857d575b91ffa6e","title":"british families choose to stay in china rather than be separated coronavirus","story":"Relatives remain at centre of coronavirus outbreak as those with Chinese passport barred from leavingTwo British families trapped at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak have chosen to stay in the country after they were told they could not bring their loved ones with them on an evacuation flight.After the flight for UK nationals leaving Wuhan was delayed to Friday morning, the Chinese authorities maintained their position that no one with a Chinese passport would be allowed to travel.Along with not wanting to split up, the families also expressed concerns about the possibility of contracting the virus on the flight or in the airport.Matt Raw has lived in Wuhan for the past year with his wife, Ying, and 75-year-old mother, Hazel, who suffers from dementia. Ying has a UK visitor visa valid until July but her Chinese passport means she is not allowed on the flight and the family has decided to stay put.Raw, from Knutsford in Cheshire, said: “My mother is old, and who’s the virus affecting worst? Old people. I would hate for anything to happen to her and I would much rather be somewhere where the virus isn’t.”However, he said the family had plenty of food to keep them going and enough of his mother’s medication to last at least a couple of months, and had been assured by the Foreign Office that if China did change its stance on the issue, the UK would work with partners to get them on to another flight out the country.He said his wife had concerns about the safety of the journey and the risk of contracting the virus from other passengers en route.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.A British father and daughter also decided to stay in the country rather than leave behind their wife and mother, who has a Chinese passport.Previously the father, who does not want to be named, said: “It’s just awful weighing up taking my daughter out and keeping her safe, but leaving my wife behind.”The family also experienced problems getting hold of paperwork to enable them to pass through roadblocks that have been placed throughout Hubei province to limit movement.Raw said the FCO sent an email to all British nationals heading to the airport with a letter explaining their situation in Chinese, to help people pass through. But for many, the email ended up in their junk inbox, and he said that on a group chat for Britons in Wuhan there was much confusion over how to make it to the airport.He said: “The FCO has let us down so badly. They’ve told us so many things and communicated so badly with us that we just take everything they say with a pinch of salt. We don’t believe anything they say any more.”An FCO spokesperson said: “Our priority is to keep British nationals and their family members together and have urgently raised this with the Chinese authorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0a2a57b22edb825c00af91fb23995056de44fe/0_82_6008_3604/master/6008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9563fef2218414e301c9a232c12d40d8","title":"coronavirus hundreds stranded wuhan uk evacuation flight delayed","story":"Flight due to land at RAF Brize Norton on Friday and returnees will face 14 days quarantineAround 120 Britons will fly from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak overnight and land in the UK on Friday morning where they will be taken to Wirral for a fortnight’s quarantine.It news came shortly before the risk level from the virus in the UK was raised from low to moderate and the World Health Organization declared it a global health emergency.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, announced that the emergency flight, which was delayed by 24 hours, would be taking off from Wuhan and was due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire at around 9am.Military doctors will be onboard the chartered plane in case immediate treatment is necessary, although any passengers displaying symptoms of the virus – which can include a sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties – will be barred from boarding.It is understood there will be a quarantine area in the plane in case somebody falls ill during the flight.The returnees will be bussed to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral where they will be monitored and treated if any symptoms develop. They will be staying in an accommodation block usually designated for NHS staff. Margaret Greenwood, the Labour MP for Wirral West, said she had spoken to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who told her that experts believed it was unlikely that those quarantined had the virus.Passengers were asked to sign contracts agreeing to the 14-day quarantine as a condition of getting the flight home. A further 50 EU nationals will also be on the chartered flight, which will fly on to Spain where it will complete its journey.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of January 30, the death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 70 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Raab said: “We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January. The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need.”Some Britons with family members who hold a Chinese passport have decided to remain in Wuhan because they faced being separated if they had chosen to travel.Matt Raw and his 75-year-old mother, Hazel, were entitled to a place on the flight but are staying in Wuhan as Matt’s wife, Ying, a Chinese national, was not allowed to board because of strict rules imposed by the Chinese government.The death toll from the virus, which has spread to at least 16 countries, has reached 170, and there are more than 7,700 confirmed cases in China. A total of 161 British nationals have so far tested negative for the virus.Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said it was “highly likely” there would be a positive case in the UK in the coming days.On Thursday night the four chief medical officers of the UK increased the risk level ofcoronavirus from low to moderate. They said they “do not think the risk toiniduals in the UK has changed” but that the government should “plan for all eventualities”. A British woman in Wuhan who claimed she was told she would have to leave her three-year-old son behind if she flew out because he had a Chinese passport said the Foreign Office was in discussions with counterparts in the country about her situation.Natalie Francis, originally from York, said on Wednesday that Foreign Office staff in London told her she could leave on a flight but that her son Jamie must stay. She said she was told “nothing can be done”.The first US case of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus has been confirmed by health officials. The inidual is married to a Chicago woman who was diagnosed with the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan.Elsewhere, an Italian cruise ship carrying 6,000 passengers was held at a port near Rome after two Chinese passengers fell ill with suspected coronavirus.The couple boarded the Costa Smeralda on 25 January and later came down with fevers and breathing problems. However, local reports suggested they had tested negative.An apartment-hotel in Yorkshire was put on lockdown after a man believed to be a Chinese national was taken to hospital on Wednesday evening by paramedics clad in quarantine suits.York’s Staycity Hotel confirmed that the apartment where the man was staying had been sealed off and would undergo “a thorough environmental clean and disinfection”.British Airways announced it would suspend flights to and from China to the end of February, one of a number of carriers stopping or reducing services to the affected country.Russia closed its border with China and moved to stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, pledged: “We have to do everything to protect our people.”As China reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths, the country’s football association cancelled all domestic games.

In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 160 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which started on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities in Hubei province are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

It is estimated there are eight Irish citizens in the affected region, which has been in effective lockdown since the Chinese authorities imposed severe transport restrictions in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.On Monday, the mayor of Wuhan, in Hubei, acknowledged criticism of his handling of the crisis, and offered to resign. There is growing anger among residents that they were not informed earlier about the risk posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December.The number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3,000, with 400 of these critical. The number of suspected cases now stands at more than 5,700, but experts believe thousands more could eventually be infected.Stocks markets tumbled worldwide yesterday following concerns about the possible economic impact of the coronavirus.ConcernMembers of the Chinese community in Ireland have expressed concern about the presence here of a tour party from the region of the country where the coronavirus originated.The group left China before restrictions were imposed on travel there, came to Britain and then travelled on to Ireland on the ferry from Holyhead at the weekend. Chinese social media posts show a woman member of the group posing at various landmarks, including Trinity College in Dublin and the Titanic Centre in Belfast. “We are the only tour from Wubei that can travel in UK. That’s not easy,” the woman posted on Weibo, a social media site. She also posted a picture from the Holyhead ferry, on which members of her group had played poker.While there is no evidence the group posed any health threat, its presence in Ireland prompted criticism on Chinese social media. One poster warned the community in Ireland, and in particularly Chinese restaurants, to “be aware” of their presence.Surgical masksMedical suppliers are reporting a big jump in demand for surgical masks in response to the coronavirus outbreak in China, with some Dublin stores saying they have run out of stocks.Demand has been particularly high among the Chinese community, especially from those who travelled home to mark the Chinese New Year at the weekend.The Department of Health said its National Public Health Emergency Team met on Monday to review the ongoing preparedness of the Irish health system for any cases of the virus that occur in Ireland. A statement gave no details of the group’s deliberations but pointed out that no confirmed cases had occurred here.Waterford Institute of Technology said one of its students was in self-isolation after travelling from Wuhan at the weekend.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim Wilson: \u0027This isn’t what I signed up for: to be told by the British government to just ‘suck it up, and too bad this is the way it is going to be’.\u0027  Photograph: Enda O’Dowd In the distance over Jim Wilson’s shoulder stand the famous yellow Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes Samson\u0026nbspand Goliath, symbols on the landscape reflecting Belfast’s one-time economic might.Directly behind him is the only loyalist mural in Northern Ireland – in east Belfast – paired with another in the nearby nationalist Short Strand.Wilson, a former loyalist paramilitary in the Red Hand Commandos, is now a community worker committed to peace, and proud of the mural and the journey it represents.The murals depict two children, one Wilson’s grandson and the other the niece of a former Sinn Féin deputy lord mayor. The children are reaching out to shake hands in the murals, based on a poem called No More. The message is clear: the next generation wants no part in the violence of the past.This mural was unveiled 10 years ago, but the recent political ructions caused by Brexit in the North have stirred new concerns and tensions within the loyalist community, particularly among the younger generation.Loyalists oppose a trade border in the Irish Sea, the compromise agreed by British prime minister Boris Johnson and the EU in October that paves the way for the UK’s orderly departure from the EU on Friday.Loyalists see the new border in symbolic terms as eroding their political identity as unionists and British subjects of the crown.They see the new customs and regulatory frontier on the Irish Sea not as London, Dublin and Brussels see it – a compromise to avoid a hard Irish land Border that could have sparked republican anger and potentially violence – but as a step to Irish economic unity.For this they blame Johnson, who vowed at the DUP conference in 2018 not to create any economic barriers in the Irish Sea. Their anger is not helped by the confused messages from Johnson and UK officials about the checks required on goods moving between the North and Britain after Brexit.Days after Johnson said there would “emphatically” be no checks on trade across the Irish Sea, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, on a visit to Belfast on Monday, said checks on goods entering the North from Britain were “indispensable” consequences of the deal.‘Suck it up’Wilson says there is “a lot of anger” in the loyalist community that Johnson “totally betrayed” the British people of Northern Ireland.“This isn’t what I signed up for: to be told by the British government to just ‘suck it up, and too bad this is the way it is going to be’.”After the deal was unveiled in October a series of public meetings and rallies brought together a broad sweep of unionists and loyalists to protest against the deal they call the “betrayal act”.Wilson says Johnson’s deal was a “complete somersault”, and “the ultimate sell-out” which breaches the 1998 Belfast Agreement that underpins the peace process.“Economically he is tying us to the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. It might seem like it is the EU but that’s not the way the loyalist people look at it: they look at it as we are being tied to an economic united Ireland, which was not in the Good Friday agreement.”Wilson fears a repeat of the 2012-13 flag protests when loyalists protested over the limited number of days the union flag was flown over Belfast’s City Hall. He said the protests left hundreds of young Loyalists with criminal records that hurt their future prospects.“Those sort of things are not realistic anymore. I would hope that there are a few things up our sleeves that we could do, but I wouldn’t want to ulge it now. It is hard to explain how you feel when you have been betrayed by your own prime minister.”The former member of Red Hand Commando – a group affiliated with the Ulster Volunteer Force that was responsible for 500 murders in the Troubles – is clear there is “no appetite” to return to the violence of the past.However, Wilson is fearful of the impact of the “armchair generals” and “Facebook warriors” provoking the anger of younger loyalists via well-followed social media channels, some of which are saying “we will not be the generation to fail Northern Ireland”.“I couldn’t tell you where it’s going to go, to tell you the truth,” Wilson says.Criminal elementsEarlier, Wilson had shared his concerns on how Brexit might be used by some criminal elements within the loyalist community during a talk on post-conflict Northern Ireland with a group of US students hosted by Queen’s University.Some in the loyalist community would “saber-rattle”, he warned, speaking alongside Sinn Féin Belfast city councillor and republican Séanna Walsh, who famously read out the IRA statement announcing the end of its armed campaign.“This is not about their loyalism or their Britishness. This about giving them a reason to exist so that they can turn around and can continue to do their drug-dealing, their gangsterism, their money-lending.” These people would “love nothing better than a conflict to start up again because it will mask what they are doing”.He said “loyalism is not in a good place at the moment”.East of Belfast on Bangor’s loyalist Kilcooley estate – one of the biggest in the North – Alison Blayney, who runs the Kilcooley Women’s Centre (part-funded with EU money), says younger loyalists who are active on social media are “hopping mad” and feel “hugely betrayed” over the Brexit deal, which they see as “a one-way route to an economic united Ireland”.She does not believe there will be violence from the loyalist community in response to it: she feels people are “passed that stage” and “wise to the fact that it doesn’t achieve what it used to”.“They are moving towards thinking things through, thinking their politics through, but how they channel that I am not sure. It is a worrying time because I think they won’t accept it.”Blayney is hopeful that the EU and UK can tweak the Irish Sea border arrangements in this year’s trade talks, but she warns against the “dangerous words” being used on the checks.“It’s dangerous terminology because no one really understands what is going to happen because there are different messages coming out.”DivisionsAt Ledley Hall Boys and Girls Club in east Belfast, young loyalists are worried that Sinn Féin is trying to take advantage of the isions over Brexit in the North to push for a Border poll on Irish unity. The party has pledged to secure a poll within five years as one of its manifesto promises south of the Border in the run-up to the February 8th general election.This, as loyalists see it, will inevitably cause tensions between the North’s two communities. “Sinn Féin’s election posters will be ‘we got the sea border, next we are going for the Border poll.’ We will be reminded of it every day,” said one of the youth club’s workers, who only wanted to be identified as ‘KC’.“Anything that we take as a win they take as a loss, so if they are taking it as a win we will be wary of it.”Nationalists will, he says, see the Irish Sea border as a “financial united Ireland” and “the first step to a united Ireland” – a prospect that loyalists abhor.“The words ‘united Ireland’ to a unionist or a loyalist is just petrifying because you have been told by your granny growing up, ‘it is never going to happen, not in your lifetime’, and now it possibly could,” he said.Wayne Gilmour (25), a self-declared loyalist activist from a working-class background who was a regular demonstrator in the flags protests, sees the Brexit deal as in effect giving Northern Ireland as “a delayed gift to the South”.He said it has created “great mistrust”, and fed “the paranoia and siege mentality” among loyalists-unionists.“I know people that would never have been political, wouldn’t have been openly hardline about anything, and they are falling into the fringes,” he said, sitting in a community office in the loyalist Tiger’s Bay area of north Belfast.Loyalists are angered by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s failure to take account of their community’s views or worries during the Brexit process. Gilmour was incensed by Varadkar’s comments in October that people in the North would still be able to post letters in red postboxes after the Brexit deal.Arrogance“Who does he think he is? The arrogance is unbelievable. He is the representative of a foreign state he shouldn’t have any say in the affairs of our state at all.”Although Gilmour is not suggesting violence as a means to oppose the deal, he said he could understand why it is seen as a possibility given that the compromise deal came about in response to the “threat of violence from Irish republicanism” over a potential hard land Border.“It would be foolhardy and naive of the British government to mistake or think that loyalism will be quietly pushed into a corner, and will be pacified and accept the deal as it is,” he said, anticipating “mass protests” from the likes of the Orange Order and other bodies opposed to it.Gilmour says Loyalists are “stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment”, and that “any deal that dilutes the sovereignty of Northern Ireland will be resisted”.He says he is too young to have experienced the height of the Troubles, but is fearful of a possible return to violence.“I fear the night when you hear the rumble and you know what’s happened. It is that sinking feeling. It is just shared among the loyalist community at the moment there’s a feeling of despair that it is going backwards and we can’t stop it.”He says violence is horrible and wrong, but he warns of a “strange duality” within loyalism.“If it does fall backwards you are going to have to do what you can to protect your people’s birthright. If the state can’t do it, you do it.“That in-built sense, that I know it’s not normal to have, but that lies in the back of your head: what if? What are you prepared to do? And no one should be asking themselves that, but we feel that neglected and pushed.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe There is usually a decent amount of time between the break-up of a boy band and the first reunion tour, the timing of which has a lot to do with a need to start making money again.Not so with Independent Alliance, barely a wet weekend out of Leinster House with an emotional nation still coming to terms with the break-up and the members are back on the road collecting votes again.It’s a familiar scenario. The split has happened, but one of them is still gigging away and the others, out of a sense of duty and an unquenchable thirst for the limelight, consent to a short run of comeback performances.So here they are again, limbering up for another tilt at greatness. The Three Amigos. The lads. The state of them.Shane Ross, the lead singer. He’s looking a bit battered now. One arm in a sling, election rosette pinned defiantly above his heavily strapped left hand.Bring it on.Dapper John Halligan, rocking the black suede shoes and natty tweed coat. The bohemian hair a symphony in pepper and salt. He casually mentions he’s just come from Áras an Uachtaráin, where he’s been hanging out with the President.Finian McGrath, chillin’ in the car park. Sitting in the boot of his car, under the lid, smoking a cigarette.It’s Ross – known to fans as Winston Churchtown – who can’t leave the Dáil scene. And his boys have his back.‘I’m lost’Thursday afternoon and they’re in the middle of their three week “For One Campaign Only” tour of Dublin Rathdown. They have a gig in Ballinteer at half-three after Winston completes a press conference in the Department of Sport on the bailout of the Football Association of Ireland.A very welcome move. That’s one way to drum up votes.“To be honest,” he says, “the timing was not of our choice. I know what people are saying but there’s a compelling reason why it should be done very urgently because of the finances – they’re perilous and the urgency comes from their condition, not from any electoral consideration. It had to be done.”Speaking of timing, he’s late. The other two (both outgoing junior ministers) wait inside the main doors of SuperValu, until they are thrown out for canvassing.Halligan has come up from Waterford to give the senior man his support. McGrath, formerly of Dublin Bay North, has made the more arduous trip across from the Northside. Clearly disorientated, he hasn’t brought his guitar.Finian, do you know where you are? “No. I don’t a clue where I am. I’m lost. I’m not okay with this part of the city.”John wanders over. “I was in Churchtown last week. We were both in Churchtown, Finian.”Ruth Buchanan, Ross’s wife, is keeping an eye on proceedings. “We have great guides for them. They’re a wonderful team of girls. We’ll make sure they don’t get lost.”Since the Dáil was dissolved, Halligan (Minister of State for Training and Skills) and McGrath (Minister of State for Disability) have been beating a track up and down to Áras An Uachtaráin on official duty.As they are still office holders but not standing for election, the pair are being drafted in to replace senior ministers – who are busy defending their seats – at formal events.“I was there on behalf of Simon Coveney today. It was excellent. Michael D was meeting 61 ambassadors. I had a great chat with the Palestinian ambassador.”“They’re great gigs,” says Finian, who has subbed on a couple of occasions in the past two weeks. “I have a few more coming up.”The two men will remain in office until at least February 20th, and maybe much longer, depending on the election outcome and subsequent horse-trading.John Halligan brought volunteers from Waterford to join team Ross. He intends to step up the effort next week. “I’m going to stay with Shane for two nights and canvass for two nights. I’ve good time for him and I hope he gets elected. He helped me in the constituency when I asked him.”He tells Ruth. “I’m up with you next Wednesday, Thursday.”“I know,” she says. “You’re not vegan, are you?”“No. I just don’t eat red meat.”“Do you eat fish.”When he finally arrives, the outgoing Minister for Transport and Sport says he will do the cooking. Ruth laughs. Her husband, one arm out of action, is explaining how he sustained his injury to yet another curious potential number one vote.Recognition factorThe two junior ministers hand out leaflets to shoppers in SuperValu’s porch. It’s mid-afternoon and not very busy. Halligan writes down a constituent’s concerns on the back of a canvassing card. She wants help in setting up a residents’ association.There’s a triumphant cry from McGrath, who has been chatting to an elderly woman. “Four number ones in this house!”Winston Churchtown, meanwhile, is deep in conversation. “I wasn’t running. No, I was running to the car . . . tripped over a kerb . . . Two broken fingers, one dislocated, one split . . . big operation . . . four hours . . .”He may not be mopping up votes but he’s certainly mopping up sympathy. Some people are saying he hurt himself on purpose. “A bit extreme, I would have thought,” he says.Then again, every cloud and all that: “They all want know what happened. It’s a good recognition factor. It’s a big plus.”The three amigos have been out and about doing the housing estates. Having a good time. They love having group photographs taken. On three occasions, they miss sets of twins being wheeled past them into the shopping centre. The  photographer is heartbroken.Eventually, after the candidate has\u0026nbspfilled a very concerned young woman in on the extent of his injuries, somebody asks if the group might pose for a photo with her gorgeously gurgling and photogenic twin baby girls.“Oh no, they’re not mine.”“It was Crumlin Road,” laughs Donal Donnelly. His wife Caitríona tells us he escaped “60 years ago last year. He was only 21 at the time. And he was the only prisoner they never caught.”Finian pointed over at John. “The Marxist wing is over here!”Dog fightIt’s all good fun, but Shane Ross knows his seat is in danger. The word in the constituency is that sitting Green Party TD Catherine Martin will top the poll with more than a quota.“Catherine’s number twos are key,” said Finian sagely, uttering\u0026nbspa sentence that nobody expected to hear during the Dublin Rathdown campaign.It might explain why Winston has a very visible green “recycled” printed inside a recycle logo on all of his posters. It might win a few of those valuable green preferences.Halligan and McGrath say it will be a hard slog for their colleague. “I’ve been out a few times. He’s in a tough battle, you know. He’s fighting for that last seat. There’s no point in saying otherwise – it’s a very difficult one.“That’s the vibe I’m getting. But he knows that. He knows he’s in a dog fight but I still think he’ll survive, says Finian.Ross is under no illusions. He knows he is fighting for the last seat in a three-seater, with the first two going to the Greens and Fine Gael. “I think the bookies have me getting in just marginally. I don’t know, it’s very difficult to tell.”As for the end of the Independent Alliance – he is sorry his two amigos have retired. But he fully expects a reformed line-up in the next Dáil. There will be another group of Independents who will want a platform.But for now, the Three Amigos are enjoying their encore.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4156201.1580416110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus declared public health emergency by who","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople wait in a queue and gather outside outside a pharmacy selling masks in Hong Kong on January 30th, 2020, as a preventative measure after a virus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Photograph: Dale de la ReyGetty ImagesThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared an international public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak just hours before an evacuation flight to bring British nationals back to the UK is due to leave the Chinese city of Wuhan.Health experts made the announcement on Thursday evening following a meeting of the WHO emergency committee in Geneva.It comes as about 150 UK citizens are due to be brought back from China on a flight leaving Wuhan city at 7am local time on Friday – 11pm Thursday UK time.Speaking to reporters, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.”Last week, WHO said it was “too early” to declare an international public health emergency but on Thursday said action was needed to help countries to prepare for the possibility of it spreading further.The new virus has now infected more people in China than fell ill during the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak. The number of cases has jumped to 7,711, surpassing the 5,327 people diagnosed with Sars.The death toll, which rose to 170 on Thursday morning, is lower than the 348 people who died in China from Sars.In the UK, 161 people have tested negative for the virus as of Thursday.The Department of Foreign Affairs also updated its travel advice on Wednesday to Irish citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China.The Irish ambassador to China, Eoin O’Leary, advised the Irish community there of the travel warning in an email on Wednesday.“We also advise that if you are thinking of leaving China, it would be better to do so sooner than later,” he said.“We are doing this primarily in case there are further restrictions on travel to, from or within China by the Chinese or other authorities.”EvacuationThree Irish citizens who have been under lockdown for the past week will be evacuated out of Wuhan early on Friday on a flight arranged by the British government for its nationals.The flight was originally supposed to leave on Thursday but there were delays obtaining final permission from the Chinese authorities.The plane, with approximately 200 passengers on board, is scheduled to depart at 5am on Friday local time and fly to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.The evacuees will then be taken by bus to a National Health Service facility in north-west Britain for a 14-day quarantine period, sources said.Fifty foreigners — mainly from EU countries — will also be on the evacuation flight which will head to Spain afterwards.British nationals and the three Irish people have been asked to make their own way to the airport, and it is understood the British Consulate has provided letters to help people in cars get past security checkpoints.Passengers say they have been told only to take hand luggage on the flight.Of 1,466 passengers and 95 staff who arrived in the UK from Wuhan between January 10th and 24th , some 162 have already left the UK and 760 are now outside the 14-day incubation period for the virus.Meanwhile, British Airways has extended its suspension of all flights to and from mainland China until Monday.Virgin Atlantic flights between Heathrow and Shanghai are continuing to operate as scheduled. – Additional reporting from PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4156519.1580412104!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus three irish people to be evacuated from wuhan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDoctors watch as  medical supplies from Beijing are unloaded at a hospital in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province on Thursday.

The Kremlin said it was closing its 4,200-kilometre border with China, and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals.“We have to do everything to protect our people,” prime minister Mikhail Mishustin said.While some flights between China and Russia are still operating, the foreign ministry warned Russians to avoid non-essential travel to the country.Russia hasn’t yet reported any cases of the deadly virus, which has now spread to at least 20 countries and territories around the world.China reported 38 new deaths on Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities from the illness to 170, with confirmed infections up to 8,000.One of the new fatalities was reported in Chengdu, Sichuan province, while the remaining where in Hubei, the province where the virus originated.Tibet confirmed its first case on Thursday, meaning the coronavirus has now spread to all of mainland China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.A growing number of governments have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to mainland China, and more than 30 airlines, include British Airways and Lufthansa, have suspended or cut back flight services.Hubei has been sealed off for more than a week since the emergency was declared, with more than 50 million people self-isolating in effective lockdown.Several countries have been evacuating, or making plans to evacuate, their nationals out of the province this week.Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China consider its territory, has also requested permission to repatriate its passport holders, but Beijing has not responded to the request, Taiwanese officials said.Japan’s number of confirmed cases climbed to 11 on Thursday after three Japanese citizens who were among the 200 passengers evacuated out of Wuhan on Wednesday tested positive.Two of the three new confirmed cases showed no symptoms, officials said.Off the coast of Italy, some 6.000 passengers and 1,000 crew aboard a cruise ship docked north of Rome have been quarantined for more than 24 hours after one passenger from Macau had a fever and showed flu-like symptoms.Tests are being carried out on the woman and her husband, and the case has been reported to the Italian maritime authorities. Initial tests have come back negative, officials said.US health officials announced America’s first case of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus on Thursday. The patient, who has not been to China recently, is married to a woman who was confirmed with the infection after she returned from a trip to Wuhan.This is the sixth US confirmed case, with the other five all travellers who developed the illness after returning from China."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4156519.1580412104!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish in wuhan life is quiet and peaceful i ll miss that when it goes back to normal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDoctors watch as  medical supplies from Beijing are unloaded at a hospital in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province on Thursday. Photograph: Chinatopix via APToday the sun came through the blinds, bright and yellow. It was a nice change, the last few days had started dull and grey. Two noses, eight paws, and two tails are dancing, walking and jumping around the bed telling me it’s time for the day to begin.Up, washed, dressed, masks and leads on, ready for road. It was time to make our bi-daily pilgrimage around the community, with the two dogs.The first thing to hit when the elevator arrives is the smell of bleach. The doors open, it’s so bad I’m thankful that I’m wearing a mask and I pity my two furry friends. I have to carry one because she’s repelled by the wet bleach they’re spraying around the elevator – it’s on the walls, the floor and the ceiling.Outside it’s a pleasant day, warm – no wind. Usually, there are very few people outside, you might catch one, like an apparition or a shadow haunting a faraway corner or gliding along a path. A few days ago, it was strange, we met two men in full, yellow hazmat suits.My girlfriend went pale, the dogs thought it was for their amusement in the end, we just kept to our side of the road and they stayed on theirs. Scary sight but it turns out they’re volunteers driving medical personal around the city. There are actually a few people doing it living in my community.Today was different, we met quite a few older people out having a walk. The pleasant weather and the monotony have encouraged people to venture out. Everyone was wearing masks, everyone was careful, everyone kept their distance.We dallied and played a little at the very back of the community. The dogs like it there and it’s usually pretty empty, just abandoned refrigeration units, street food carts and rusty trucks that never seem to move. On the way back we met and startled a young woman who was sitting on a kerb enjoying the sunshine. When all of this began a rumour had circulated about dogs spreading the virus so people are wary of them. People have even been dumping their pets.As we walked into our apartment building, I saw a sign that looked official so I snapped a photo to translate it. Turns out there are two people who may have the virus living in the building. That explains the excessive amounts of bleach in the elevator.Breakfast was uneventful, we cooked a simple meal and once it was eaten, we cleaned the whole place. The apartment was starting to get a claustrophobic feeling so we opened all the doors and windows, got out the Chinese “Mr Muscle” and now the place is gleaming.Chat groupsThe rest of the day is spent, like every other day since we’ve been locked down, checking social media, watching movies, TV shows or reading. Our phones are constantly on the go we’re both in lots of chat groups and recently there has been a lot discussion about evacuations. I’m not leaving. My life and loved ones are here so Ireland will have to wait until July or August to see me again.Tonight, just like every other night, darkness slowly crept into the room. It always seems to seep up from the floors, up along the walls slowly turning the whiteness and gleam to grey and then quickly turning everything to black. We’ll spend tonight watching another virus-themed movie. Herself wants to watch Contagion so we’ll watch that and The Outsider, walk the dogs, then go to bed. Another day done.There’s a lot of sensationalist stuff being written and said about the situation here in Wuhan. The tabloid media has painted this like it’s an “end of the world” situation. No one here thinks that. The Chinese are quite positive. They’re confident - since new medical teams from Beijing, the military and even specialists from Europe have arrived - that a solution will all be found soon and everything will go back to normal.A few nights ago, in a dramatic outpouring of solidarity, people in apartments throughout my community, and all over China, opened their windows, shouted slogans of support and encouragement and even sang the national anthem. It was all organised through social media but people really got behind it and the racket went on for the best part of 30 minutes. It was a truly unique and unusual experience. Apart from that, life is quiet and peaceful. I’ll miss that when everything goes back to normal.* Liam Griffey is originally from Ennis, Co Clare"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4156353.1580389036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer friday is brexit day so what happens next","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish members of the European Parliament react during Wednesday’s vote confirming  Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Photograph: Yves HermanEPAAt 11pm on Friday, January 31st, after 47 years in the European Economic Community and European Union, the United Kingdom is formally leaving the bloc, some 1,317 days after the Brexit referendum. It is the first time in the history of the European economic and political bloc that it has lost a member.What will change on February 1st?In practice, everyday life will look like it was on January 31st. A business-as-usual standstill agreement, known as the transition period, means that until December 31st, 2020, the UK will continue to be bound by EU laws but will no longer have a say in how those laws are formed because Brexit means that it must leave the EU’s political institutions, bodies and agencies. The UK’s 73 MEPs have lost their jobs, freeing up two additional seats in the European Parliament for Ireland. These will be taken up by the two “cold storage” MEPs Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews and Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune who were elected last year but did not take up their seats pending the UK’s exit.During the 11-month Brexit purgatory period, the European Commission will monitor the UK’s compliance with its laws and the European Court of Justice will retain the power to make rulings and fines against the UK if breaches of EU rules and laws are identified.What does it mean for the people?British subjects will no longer be EU citizens but they will continue to enjoy free movement across the EU for the transition period. From January 1st, 2021, British people living in the remaining 27 EU member states will have their rights to live in those countries protected under the Brexit agreement. The three million EU citizens living in the UK have until June 2021 to apply for “settled status” allowing them to stay and enjoy existing rights after Brexit. Irish citizens in the UK may apply for “settled status” but do not have to because they enjoy a right of residence in the UK through the separate Common Travel Area agreement between Ireland and the UK. This long-standing relationship is not reliant on the UK’s membership of the EU.What will happen to Northern Ireland during the transition period?Nothing. The “protocol” for Ireland and Northern Ireland will not be activated as the UK will remain in the EU customs union and single market for the 11-month period. The Brexit deal’s so called “front stop” compromise - an Irish Sea trade border chosen to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - will only come into effect on January 1st, 2021.Can the transition period be extended?Yes. The Brexit deal allows the UK and EU to decide by July 1st to extend the Brexit limbo by up to two years, but UK prime minster Boris Johnson has legally blocked himself requesting an extension under legislation passed to implement the withdrawal agreement. Legislation could be amended to bypass this ban, though it would be seen as a political climbdown by Johnson.So is that the end of EU-UK negotiations?Eh, no way. Exiting was only the first part of the orce. The second involves the EU and the UK reaching an agreement on how they will work and trade with each other in the future and this is regarded as the most difficult part. The aim of the negotiations is to agree a deal that will come into force by the end of the transition period.Will that be enough time?It will be extremely difficult given the depth and range of the issues and areas to be discussed. Boris Johnson says a deal is possible by the end of the year the EU thinks otherwise. The EU’s chief trade negotiator Phil Hogan, Ireland’s commissioner, has said there will be only “four or five” negotiating rounds before July when the UK must decide whether to extend the transition period.What will those negotiations touch on?In addition to trade issues around services, fisheries, agriculture and state aid, the talks will also cover security and intelligence co-operation, data sharing, energy and transport links, research collaboration and the UK’s participation in EU science, space and education programmes.When will the negotiations begin?The European Commission will publish its draft negotiating mandate on February 3rd that must be approved by EU leaders at a summit on February 25th. Talks should begin in early March.How difficult could these negotiations be?Potentially extremely difficult. The more the UK decides to erge from the rules and standards of the EU single market, the more difficult it will be to agree a free trade agreement. One British government minister has said the UK will not align itself with EU rules after Brexit. If there is no trade deal agreed by December 31st, 2020, then the following day a “hard Brexit” will kick in: World Trade Organisation rules with hefty tariffs will automatically apply on each other’s goods.What will the early flash-point issues be?The biggest sticking points, initially at least, are likely to be on access to fishing waters and the EU’s demand for a “level playing field” where there would be no advantage between the EU and UK in competition and business subsidies, social and environmental protections, and tax.So could there still be a disorderly, cliff-edge Brexit at the end of this year?Yes, if the EU and UK cannot agree on a future trading relationship.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Alcohol? Meat? Dairy? Shaving your legs? (Yes, that’s a real thing: Janu-hairy.) Did you take up fasting, or renounce internet shopping? Did you, in fact, sit cross-legged on a pillar in prayerful silence, eating only dry bread sent up in a bucket by admiring townsfolk?If so, congratulations. You chose the easier path.I didn’t give up anything for January. I’m not keen on self-denial, least of all in midwinter. And I thought it might be fun to be the only hedonist left in town, putting real milk in my coffee like I just don’t care.But God, it’s boring, being bad when everyone else is good. It’s a well-known fact – remarked upon all in those “Why I gave up booze” articles that sheet down as unrelentingly as January rain – that drunk people seem incredibly dull once you are sober. But this turns out to be even more true in reverse.For the past 31 days, all my friends and neighbours have been consumed by abstinence. It’s all they talk about: the drinks they’re not drinking, the food they’re not eating. Worse, it’s been happening under my own roof. Two of my children have given up eating meat for January. My husband, not to be out-deprived, has given up meat, wheat, sugar and alcohol.I admire their discipline, but deplore its effects. Our evenings, which once were filled with friends and laughter and the pulling of corks, are now spent trawling the internet for child-friendly tofu recipes. My husband goes to bed at 8.30pm to read a book – “Might as well, there’s nothing else to do” – while I sit in an empty kitchen, rattling a lonely gin and tonic. I don’t even particularly want one. It’s just a gesture of defiance.“Neither abstinence nor excess ever renders man happy,” said Voltaire. Being the lone contrarian in a mass abstinence movement is a whole new category of woe.Lock up your smartphonesThere is one vice I would like to give up. Wouldn’t it be nice to be cured of the smartphone itch? To no longer feel your nervous system being tweaked and tugged at by the gadget in your pocket?On her Madame X concert tour, Madonna has resorted to confiscating her audience’s mobile phones. On arriving at the concert venue, they are ordered to switch their devices on to silent and then place them inside a special lockable pouch. They can keep the pouch with them, but it can only be opened by security staff stationed at the exits. (There is a special phone zone for the worst-afflicted addicts, shuffling and twitching as they refresh their Insta-feed.)Yondr, the Silicon Valley firm that makes these simple fabric pouches, claims to be on a mission to restore the human attention . It has started supplying pouches to hospitals, schools and even churches across the US. On any given day, there are 2,000 Yondr pouches in use in the courtrooms of Philadelphia alone.But the tech giants aren’t worried by this insurrection. On the contrary: last week Google unveiled its own paper envelope that can be slotted over a smartphone to make it stupid again. All smartphones now have built-in apps that are supposed to limit screen time. It’s rather sinister, this apparent solicitude. Why are tech firms offering to save us from their own products? Because they know it won’t work.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for pants. No rummaging through Primark for\u0026nbspsocks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress​, writes Olivia PetterI despair when I watch Love Island. It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater. It’s about what they wear.\u0026nbspEvery year, the same cohort of aspiring Instagram influencers bounds into that sun-soaked villa claiming to be “looking for love” when in fact, the only thing they’re looking for is a contract with Boohoo. Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man. They follow in the footsteps of former contestants like Kem Cetinay, Amber Davies and Olivia Buckland, who have also gone on to partner with fast fashion brands since leaving the show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.Winter Love Island 2020: Meet the 12 contestants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shaugna is a democratic services officer from London.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest version of Apple’s wireless earbuds\u0026nbspAirPods sold well during the festive season.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShares in the company rose 1 per cent after the announcement. Apple has more than doubled in value since a low last year, adding more than $725bn\u0026nbsp(£560bn)\u0026nbspto its market capitalisation and cementing its position as America’s most valuable company.Apple sold $56bn-worth\u0026nbsp(£43bn) of iPhone 11s in the quarter, following the launch of the latest iteration of the firm’s flagship handset in September.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It would work like products already offered by companies like Tile: allowing people to stick the tracker to items such as keys or a wallet, and use the phone to find them.iPhone availability could be hit by rise of coronavirus, Apple warnsThe tracking chip has been rumoured since last year, and an ultra wide band chip that was included in the latest phones appears to have been targeted at that precise feature. Updates to the Find My app on iPhones\u0026nbsp– which currently only locates friends and Apple devices – also suggest that the tracker could be used from within there.The tracker had been expected to arrive last year, potentially alongside the iPhone 11. The new report suggests that it has not been cancelled and is still expected to arrive later this year.Apple is also rumoured to be working on new headphones, which would include the technology from the AirPods put them in a design that goes over the ears rather than inside of them. Beats already makes headphones with some of those same features.The return of the charger is perhaps the most unexpected of the newly rumoured updates. Apple first unveiled its AirPower charging mat in 2017 and then cancelled it last year amid rumours that the technology was proving too difficult, but Kuo claims it will return though perhaps in a different form.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company has been working to improve it ever since, as well as adding new features to the app.Apple Maps adds indoor airport info to make travelling less stressful“We set out to create the best and most private maps app on the planet that is reflective of how people explore the world today,”\u0026nbspEddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of internet software and services, said in a statement. “It is an effort we are deeply invested in and required that we rebuild the map from the ground up to reimagine how Maps enhances people’s lives — from navigating to work or school or planning an important vacation — all with privacy at its core.The completion of the new map in the United States and delivering new features like Look Around and Collections are important steps in bringing that vision to life. We look forward to bringing this new map to the rest of the world starting with Europe later this year.”Apple has repeatedly stressed the privacy features of Maps, which include a design that prevents the company from tracking users as they navigate around, unlike competitors such as Google Maps.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What exactly did you achieve by meeting that fool? And what’s with the hands draped all over him? Enlighten me as to the benefits you can now share with us all, after your meeting with him.”Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show.

So sad to see so many people in their little bunkers, in their teeny little helmets, sniping at the world outside. I’m surprised that there are so many of them...”In another tweet, she wrote: “I talk to and take pictures with whomever I like. Always have. Always will. Tra-la-la, #haters.”Greer also commented several time on Fox’s “incredible” and “amazing” shoes, which she said she was “fixated by”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and we have world-leading clinicians and expert teams working to protect UK patients and staff to the highest standards possible.Twitter said the tool had been introduced in response to increasing online discussion about the virus outbreak.Given the rapidly evolving nature of the issue and the growing international response, we\u0027ve launched a new dedicated search prompt to ensure that when you come to the service for information about the coronavirus, you\u0027re met with credible, authoritative information first, the company said in a blog post on the feature.The number of cases of coronavirus has jumped to 7,711, with 170 deaths.India confirmed its first case on Thursday, as did the Philippines.In the UK, 161 people have tested negative for the virus as of Thursday.An evacuation flight to bring British nationals back to the UK from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak will leave on Thursday night, the

When they arrive at the Earth\u0027s ionosphere, they excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms found in the upper atmosphere, and that energy is released as lights.Created with Sketch.Northern Lights across the UK - in pictures Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireThe beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireWhile the northern lights are often seen as one phenomenon, they are something like clouds: there are a whole host of different kinds, each of which are formed in their own particular ways.The new discovery began when the University of Helsinki\u0027s\u0026nbspMinna Palmroth looked to collect these different kinds of northern lights, in collaboration with enthusiasts. Those hobbyists took photographs of thousands of different examples of the northern lights, which she picked through and categorised for a book to guide those watching the\u0026nbspaurora borealis.A complete guide to the Northern LightsBut as the hobbyists collected those images through Facebook, they found that many of them included a kind of auroral form that was not part of the existing classification. Those were set aside to be examined later, and the book was published.Just days after it came out, enthusiasts spotted the mysterious form again: they saw a green-tinged, even set of waves that looked similar to dunes on a sandy beach. They told Professor Palmroth, who was able to get to work looking into it.One of the most memorable moments of our research collaboration was when the phenomenon appeared at that specific time and we were able to examine it in real time, says Northern Lights and astronomy hobbyist\u0026nbspMatti\u0026nbspHelin\u0026nbspin a statement.The hobbyists and space researchers worked together to collate photos from across Finland. Combining the images – and looking for clues such as stars in the background – allowed the scientists to discover where exactly the lights were coming from.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their waveform stretched 45 kilometres across.That height put them in a particularly neglected part of the sky: it is where the Earth\u0027s atmosphere collides with the edge of space, and is difficult for satellites to see.Due to the difficulties in measuring the atmospheric phenomena occurring between 80 and 120 kilometres in altitude, we sometimes call this area \u0027the\u0026nbspignorosphere\u0027, she said in a statement.The phenomenon appears to happen because of the bore phenomenon. Scientists say that gravity waves are born in the atmosphere and then rise up – but when they hit a particular layer, they can be bent and stretch out for long distances.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in Hawaii — which is twice the size of the next largest solar scope — have captured an array of cell-like structures that cover the surface of the sun, each taking up space roughly the size of the US state of Texas.It is hoped that by focussing on these areas, scientists may be better able to predict changes in the sun’s surface — including solar flares that can knock out power grids and put satellites at risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrance Córdova, National Science Foundation (NSF) director, said: “Since NSF began work on this ground-based telescope, we have eagerly awaited the first images.\u0026nbsp“We can now share these images and videos, which are the most detailed of our Sun to date.

Viruses may also reach the eyes.Coronavirus fears after York paramedics treat man in hazmat suitsJimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Independent: “There’s little evidence that they are very effective. They’re more beneficial if you have a virus and don’t want to pass it on than to prevent catching anything.”People touch their faces often, allowing bacteria to get close to the eyes, although masks do at least prevent people touching their mouths, he said. But masks do need to be changed frequently.“Better ways of preventing infection are washing your hands with warm water and soap, not touching your eyes or nose, and if you cough, cough into a tissue that you put in the bin.”Prof Whitworth said he himself would not use a mask even if coronavirus came to London.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The provincial government there has bought more than 3 million face masks.In Hong Kong and the Philippines, long queues formed outside stores with supplies.In Britain, health officials are still trying to trace about 2,000 people who flew into the country earlier this month.Boots said it was working to get more face masks in stores and online, which it hoped would arrive over the next week, but meanwhile they could be ordered at pharmacy counters.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, and B\u0026ampQ has been contacted for comment.Britons arriving from Wuhan to be quarantined for two weeksNathalie MacDermott, of King’s College London said masks meant people were not coughing or sneezing into their hand so were less likely to spread viruses when touching surfaces. But she added: “The very basic, flimsy surgical mask offers limited protection because the fit may be inadequate and they can become moist quite quickly through the act of breathing in and out.“They were not designed to protect the wearer from becoming infected with a virus, they were designed to be worn by surgical staff to protect a patient being operated on from any viruses or bacteria carried in the nose and mouth of operating theatre staff.”N95 respirators, a stronger type of mask designed to filter out pollutants, offer more protection than surgical masks, according to the New Scientist, but may also make it more difficult for a person to breathe, so could be dangerous for someone showing symptoms of infection, which include coughing and shortness of breath.The WHO’s advice on avoiding coronavirus includes hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices.

His partner, Jade Samuel, is currently on maternity leave and is due to return to work in two weeks, but won’t be able to if he\u0026nbsphas left the country, which he said would leave her “struggling to cope”.Mr\u0026nbspNembhard, who has been fighting his immigration case for years, said: “I’m really depressed. I cry when I think about my child. It’s really sensitive because I’m the world to her, and she’s the same to me. We have a really close bond and this is all starting to affect her.“My partner will struggle to cope. I don’t know what I’ll do if I have to leave my kids. The Home Office is destroying their lives.”The Jamaica charter flight is an outrage – but so are many othersDozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushThe Jamaican national arrived to the UK on a visit visa in\u0026nbsp1999. He met his ex-wife and applied to remain in the country with her but his application was refused.He continued to fight the case but was accused of assault by his ex-wife\u0026nbsp– whom he had by this point separated from and got together with Ms Samuel – an allegation he still denies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe courts found him guilty and he was sentenced to prison shortly after his daughter was born. He was then immediately detained under immigration powers, before being released on bail and settling down in\u0026nbspLondon with Ms Samuel\u0026nbspand their daughter.In February 2019, he was one of several Jamaicans\u0026nbspthreatened with deportation despite being key witnesses in the inquest into the death of an immigration detainee – but he was granted last-minute reprieve after solicitors intervened.Without immigration status, Mr Nembhard has been unable to work, but Ms Samuel, who works as a supervisor at a jewellery wholesalers, said the family “makes it work” as he is able to care for the children while she works.“He’s an amazing dad. He is their primary carer. I want to be able to work and continue providing for my family. If he is deported I’ll become a single mum, I’d have to rely on benefits. I’ve never had to do that. It took me a long time to get to this position at work but this means I will have to stop working,” she said.“When he was detained on Monday, I did the school run instead of him. My daughter asked, ‘Where’s dad? Has he gone to that place again?’ She’s been emotional. I’ve had to let her school know. She keeps asking when he’s coming home. They’re really close.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since Windrush“The immigration situation has really shaken us up over the past few years. Every time we get a bit of stability, they seem to take him away again. He deserves to be with his family. Here is where his life is.”Mr Nembhard was detained despite the fact that he had a “further submissions” appointment with the Home Office in March where his immigration case was going to be reconsidered.David\u0026nbspLammy, the family’s local MP, condemned the Home Office for putting them in this situation, saying the lives of Mr\u0026nbspNembhard’s\u0026nbspBritish wife and children were being “devastated” by the department’s “gross mishandling” of the case.The Labour MP said more broadly\u0026nbspthat it was wrong for the Home Office to be chartering deportation flights to Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean before the delayed\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspreview has been published, adding: “How can the home secretary be sure she is not making the same mistakes?”Naga Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, who is representing Mr Nembhard, said his detention was making it difficult to effectively prepare for his Home Office interview in March, and accused the Home Office of acting in a “harsh and heartless” manner towards\u0026nbspBritish children and their parents.“Without notification, Mr Nembhard was detained. Due to the complexity of his case, we need to obtain all of his past papers from previous solicitors, coroner’s inquest papers, instruct medical and social worker reports, but we cannot do this as effectively as he is incarcerated,” he said.“His family are suffering due to the absence of Mr Nembhard at home. His British wife and British children are not only deeply worried by him being incarcerated with no certainty, but also, struggling to cope as a family unit in day to day activities.”The Home Office confirmed that it would be operating a charter flight to Jamaica in the coming weeks and said those being deported had all been convicted of crimes in the UK.A spokesperson added: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK\u0026nbspshould be in no doubt of our determination to deport them. Our priority will always be to keep the British public safe.“The UK, like many other countries, uses charter flights to return people to their country of origin when they have no legal right to remain.\u0026nbsp“The majority of those returned are on scheduled, commercial flights but this isn’t always an option, especially if the inidual is a foreign national offender.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If there is something wrong, you would expect the process to find it.“I’m making no judgement, I’m making no decision. All I’m saying is, let’s do it right way not the wrong way.“On his own dealings with Bercow in nine years as his deputy, Hoyle said: “We had a working relationship - I think that’s the best way to describe it. Only once did we have a slight disagreement. I will stand my ground. I will stand up for others.”In a clear attempt to draw a line under the Bercow era, he told the parliamentary press gallery lunch that he wanted to “change the image of parliament”.“The bullying culture is over,” he said. “We are not going to tolerate it… Let’s have a new beginning. Let’s have a new start.”Sir Lindsay said that the House of Commons had been “an unhappy place to work” for MPs and staff.He admitted that MPs haven\u0027t always been the best employers, as he backed trade union recognition for staff.“I think there has been bullying in parliament. I’ve never shied away from that,” said Sir Lindsay. “It could be MP on MP, it could be staff on staff.“When an MP says to me ‘I don’t want to stand any more, it’s not a place I want to be’, we do know there are issues.”He warned that MPs’ behaviour in the House had damaged public perceptions of democracy, and said it was time for a “culture change” to counter its negative reputation.And more broadly, he added: “I think people have reflected on the way we speak to each other, the threats and intimidation, it was not a nice place. What I wanted to do was change that.“In the end, if the chamber is more calm and the way we speak to each other is better, I think that people reflect differently.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

It seemed like there\u0027s a disconnect.When he approached the candidate at a small campaign event at Urban Dreams in Des Moines, Mr Fallon says he was expecting Mr Biden to address the concerns I was raising about climate change.Instead, he says, he was surprised that Mr Biden appeared to deflect his support, should Mr Biden be selected as the Democratic nominee in the general election, during which he ostensibly would want to earn Mr Fallon\u0027s vote.He just made it more difficult, Mr Fallon says.Mr Biden has pushed back against several would-be voters throughout his campaign, including telling an immigration activist in South Carolina to vote for Trump and telling another man in Iowa — who the candidate also called a damn liar —\u0026nbspthat he\u0027s too old to vote for him.On his website, Mr Fallon writes that his most recent exchange is disturbing on a number of levels.He said: His propensity to violate personal space is a huge non-asset in politics, and his frequent gaffes are prime fodder for opponents and the media. ... Most important, Biden is simply wrong on climate change, and out-of-step with voters on so many issues.Mr Fallon says he supports Mr Steyer for his track record of environmental advocacy and promise to declare a climate emergency on the first day of his administration, if elected.On Twitter, Mr Steyer addressed Mr Biden, telling him: This is no way to treat an Iowan. He said he\u0027d vote for the Dem in the general bc he knows how important it is to beat Trump. We need immediate action on climate. If you don\u0027t agree, happy to talk @ debate.

Following the vote, members join hands and sing Auld Lang SyneIn the German village of Brunsmark, Brexit is forcing Scotsman Iain Macnab to cut short his third term as mayor which was not due to end until 2023.German authorities told him last year that his voting rights and his mayorship of the village of 170 people must end with Britain\u0027s EU withdrawal.“I will have a glass of sparkling wine with the local council on Friday and then thank them for doing an excellent job, and I will disappear into the twilight, ride off into the sunset.”Many details of Britain\u0027s separation from the EU still must be sorted out, and there will not be many visible changes on Saturday, after the tortuous orce process finally becomes official.However, the loss will be felt by Britons who left years ago to make new lives on the continent.Already disenfranchised by British electoral law, which prevents expatriates from voting in the United Kingdom after 15 years overseas, Brexit will for many usher in an uncertain future with no ability to vote anywhere.The problem could be fixed by becoming citizens of where they have chosen to live - which can be a drawn-out process.EU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rightsHowever, some expatriates do not meet the requirements, some have applied but are still awaiting the paperwork, and some simply do not want to change citizenship. Others have not got round to it, waking up late to the fact that they will soon have nowhere to vote at all.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Macnab said he does not want to be a German citizen, despite having lived in Germany for 40 years, because he may choose to move back to the UK some day.“I have been 70 years a Scot,” he said.“I don\u0027t want to ruin the chance of going back to Britain and being covered by the National Health Service.”The right for all EU nationals to vote and stand in municipal elections where they live, even if they are not citizens of that country, was enshrined in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty which established the EU.However, rules in Europe are not uniform for non-EU citizens, which is what Britons will become after Friday night. Some countries allow non-EU citizens to vote in municipal elections. So even after Brexit, Britons should still have a voice at the local level in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and in two cities in Slovakia. In Finland, they will need to have been residents for two years, while the residency requirement is five years in the Netherlands.Britain also has been negotiating directly with other EU nations to extend the ability of British expatriates to vote and run for office after Brexit. The UK Government said it has deals with Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg and is continuing talks with other administrations. It said British expatriates should also still be able to vote locally in Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia. But they will no longer be able to vote or stand locally in France, which has tens of thousands of long-term British residents and many more part-time residents of holiday homes.The French interior ministry said 757 Britons serve on municipal councils, more than any other expatriate group. They will keep their seats until municipal elections in March, but they will not be able to run or vote then if they have not gained French citizenship.For Elaine Bastian, this has come as a blow. She has been proud to serve as an elected councillor since 2014 in the village of Blond, which has 700 residents and boasts a fortified medieval church.She said: “I do feel robbed, almost, of my little crown, my hat of responsibility.“It makes me angry more than anything. I really don\u0027t like other people being able to make my life choices. It was my life choice to be a councillor.”Mr Nixey said his application for French citizenship is stuck somewhere in a Brexit-induced backlog. He is not optimistic that he will get it in time to stand again for re-election in Saint-Martial-sur-Isop.Mr Nixey said that serving on the village council, dealing with the minutiae of local services like refuse collection and road repairs, helped integrate him and his wife, Margaret, into the rural community where they raised two children. He also feels it allowed him to play a bridge-building role between newly-arrived Britons and their French neighbours.Britons in Spain bid sad adios to EU with poems, parties and pintsAbout one-third of the 140 residents of Saint-Martial and its immediate surroundings are British, many of whom were attracted by cheap housing and land. Mr Nixey worries that communication will suffer if he is not around to translate and help smooth out problems and misunderstandings.Mr Nixey said: “It\u0027s one more wall being built to prevent the further integration of people.“It is a real shame. I know the ropes. My French is good enough.”Saint-Martial mayor Pierre Bachellerie said that excluding the British expatriates will be “a big loss” for his and other villages which have been revived by the arrival of British workers and retirees.He said: “What really upsets me is that they repopulated our villages. We are lucky to have them.“For me, it\u0027s an aberration that they can no longer vote.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The police denied her a lawyer. The Mayor of Ayia Napa threatened to sue her unless she withdrew the rape allegations. And the judge conducting her trial refused to hear crucial evidence.Now, her harrowing diaries reveal just how much she suffered at their hands.If the British Government is to prevent others going through a similar ordeal, it must act without delay.First, the Prime Minister must throw his full weight behind her brave appeal to clear her name.If that doesn’t work, the Foreign Office should make no bones about advising Brits not to travel to Cyprus.Why  Because the island clearly needs a kick up the backside to reform its broken legal system. And a financially devastating exodus of British tourists would provide exactly that.We don’t believe it’s at all likely that a woman would consent to sex with a dozen strangers.

If British businesses won’t invest to train British workers, then who on earth do they think willWhich is why we’re delighted that the Government is stepping in.Under our new, improved post-Brexit immigration system, foreign workers prepared to plug jobs that don’t interest British nationals will be prioritised.And those looking to undercut our eager workers will be sent packing.Big companies that have grown used to taking shortcuts are in for a shock.But the lives of ordinary working Brits will be improved immeasurably.HAS there ever been a politician as pig-headed as Jeremy Corbyn Having led his party to its worst defeat in living memory, he plans to launch an organisation named after himself.He evidently has delusions he’ll be remembered for defeating imperialism.But his true legacy is a party on its knees, a red wall gone blue and a bunch of hard-working MPs out of jobs.If he had any sense or self-respect, he would slip quietly back into obscurity. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King. Bring Back The Bush  Bring back National Service first, please.But I honestly don’t think they’d get it even then.THIS week’s winner is Susanna Reid and Penny Proud from the Proud Family cartoons.Emailed in by Ricky J.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The figures lay bare that the five-week policy simply isn’t working - it just drives people further into poverty.Unless the DWP moves to a policy where benefits are paid promptly the queues for food banks in Glasgow, and across the country, will continue growing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. In the written question, DWP minister Will Quince said: The Department’s deductions policy strikes a fair balance between a claimant’s need to meet their obligations and their ability to ensure they can meet their day-to-day needs.From October , Universal Credit deductions have been reduced to % of a claimant’s standard allowance down from % to better achieve these objectives.If youre struggling to make your benefits stretch to cover the bills then here are a few ways that you can get extra cash.You could also be missing out on much-needed cashyou arent on the right benefits, so make sure you check what youre entitled to.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

The first one is of a young man holding a sign that reads: ‘Be kind to everyone you meet. It goes a long way.’Other messages included in the story read: ‘Kindness is when my teammates lt me up in tough times,’ ‘kindness doesnt cost a thing,’ ‘be there for each other,’ and ‘were all in this together.’The story concludes with a final message from the Duke and Duchess: We are so happy to be supporting Bells mental health campaign.”“Each time you watch @bell_letstalk official video on Instagram, Bell will donate  cents towards Canadian mental health initiatives.So please share, please talk and be part of the solution.The plea was finished with a Canadian flag emoji.The campaign is the first new initiative Meghan and Harry have promoted on their social media accounts since they stepped down as senior royals.It could mark the beginning of the Sussexes’ path to collaborating with media and commercial companies, as they embark on their path to become financially independent.Until now Harry and Meghan have been “prohibited from earning any income in any form”, but this has now changed after they stepped down as senior royals.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have launched a new website, registered in March  and developed in Toronto – the young family’s new home town, as they split their time between Canada and London.When in Britain they will also continue to use Frogmore Cottage as a base - the homes in the grounds of Windsor Castle gted to them by the Queen.While they said they will continue to support the Queen, they will no longer formally represent Her Majesty.Prince Harry last week revealed his great sadness at leaving the Royal Family but claimed he had no other option.In a speech before leaving for his new home in North America, the royal told a Sentenable crowd: It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges. And I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.The Duke claimed he wasnt walking away from the Royal Family but it wasnt possible to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and the Military without public funding."},{"url":null,"title":"rod liddle andy speak to fbi","story":"Yep, Randy Andy’s back in the headlines.The lumbering and bumbling Duke of York, to give him his proper title.You have to say,  is not looking like a very good year for the poor old Queen and Prince Philip.It’s shaping up to be a bit of a bugger, frankly.And the problems with Megxit are as nothing to the crisis enfolding around the Queen’s supposed favourite son Andrew. He will surely find himself in court very soon.This week a senior US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the prince had offered “zero co-operation” to the FBI and prosecutors.This is over his friendship with the paedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew admits he kept his friendship going with this horrible financier for longer than he should.No kidding, your highness. You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course. With Andy, somehow, there always is.He is himself accused of having sex with a -year-old lass procured for him by Epstein.This is Virginia Roberts. She is one of five women bringing a suit against the now dead Epstein and they want Prince Andrew to testy.Andy denies ever having laid a finger on Roberts. Well, OK, maybe a finger , but nowt more.Andrew has been implicated in this grotesque scandal for a long time now. The sensible thing to have done would have been to speak to the US investigators right at the outset.Becauseyou’ve got nothing to hide, there’s nothing to worry about, is there, matey But Prince Andrew’s actions have not appeared as the actions of a man with nothing to hide. He has preicated at every stage. He needs to understand that just because he says he is innocent of everything, it doesn’t mean everybody has to believe him, you know And there are plenty out there who certainly do not believe him.Sources close to Prince Andrew say he is “angry” and “bewildered” over the accusation that he offered the FBI zero co-operation.Well sure. He’s always bewildered. He’d be bewildered by a piece of paper with “see other side” written on both sides. He’d be sitting there trying to work it out for ages. He is not the sharpest tool in the box.If you’re angry and bewildered, your royal personage, then give the FBI a ring first thing tomorrow morning, US time, and tell them you are anxious to help in their inquiries.Because until this business is sorted out, there is a dark cloud over the Royal Family. And thus a dark cloud over Britain.The terrible suspicion is that our Royal Family is coming apart at the seams.Put all of our minds at rest, Andrew. Talk to the police. And tell the truth.THE Scots have banned the smacking of children by their parents.Braying the bairns was a kind of national sport up there.

It doesn’t exclude women who like football, does it  Whereas it does exclude men who couldn’t give a toss about the Leeds v Millwall game.Should we continue this sexist stereotyping and ban women from talking about Strictly or vaginal yeast infections What, under your regime, Ann, would people be allowed to talk about  Every subject excludes someone.TURKEY – the world’s worst country, in my view – is to introduce a “marry your rapist” law.A man charged with rape will be let off scot-freehe agrees to marry his victim.What the woman – or perhaps more usually, girl – thinks about this will not be taken into consideration.All this is part of president Tayyip Erdogans fervent wish to drag Turkey back into the seventh century.And he is having great success in his ambition.WELCOME to the world of , a newspaper for rich, stupid people living in North London.In yesterday’s issue they were terried about what to put in their morning cup of tea, other than tea.Milk is out because of greenhouse gases caused by the dairy industry.

And we think that we are doing well when we’re not.“And we think we’re doing badly when we’re not.“And we just haven’t learnt how to understand the public.“And we should be out there amongst the publicwe really want to understand what’s happening.”The report was written by election co-ordinator Ian Lavery and was presented to the party’s NEC.The report said it would be “unrealistic” to say their Brexit policy played no part in the defeat.But it failed to criticise Mr Corbyn’s leadership or the party’s radical policies - laying the blame with the media.It said: “It should be noted, however, that our radical manesto and Jeremy Corbyn were attacked in  on identical grounds and with comparable venom, yet Labour secured the biggest increase in its share of the vote since .“It is unlikely that radicalism was in itself the problem in a country looking for change.”Brexit and the party’s second referendum stance were to blame, it concludes.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The new Commons Speaker was also questioned about allegations against his predecessor after vowing to shake up the culture. It comes after former Clerk of the House Lord Lisvane handed Parliamentaposs Standards Commissioner a file claiming he and others were bullied by former Commons Speaker John Bercow. Mr Hoyle said he never personally witnessed bullying behaviour by Mr Bercow, but admitted: “I do speak to people who may or may not have been subjected”. He suggested allegations should be examined by the House of Lords Appointments Commission before granting Mr Bercow a peerage, but only as part of the normal due process. “I think others should decide, to look into reports, and they should make a judgement on what evidence may be there,” he told a Westminster lunch. Mr Bercow flatly denied the claims saying: I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time.  Last month Mr Hoyle said it was wrong for  Downing Street not to offer a peerage to Mr Bercow. He is now thought to have been offered a peerage by Labour. Mr Hoyle stood by his claim yesterday but claried that the “normal due process” should still apply to any appointment.Mr Hoyle stressed he was not calling for any extra probe into Mr Bercow. But he said: “What I’m saying is, when someone’s name goes forward to the Lords, people are checked and issues are reviewed about whether they are a fit person. So it’s not for me to decide, far from it. It is for those who have a duty of care to ensure that people who go to the Lords are vetted. And part of that vetting will be looking into people’s conduct or whatever’s there. Mr Hoyle said there had been a bullying culture more generally in Parliament and it “was an unhappy place to work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk rules out sending prince","story":"NewsUK rules out sending Prince Andrew to US in exchange for Harry Dunns killerDominic Raab said no one had raised the idea of a trade-off with him adding: There is no haggle and no-ones raised Prince Andrew.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBritain has ruled out “haggling” for Harry Dunn’s alleged killer infor Prince Andrew speaking to the FBI. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said “no one” had raised the idea of a trade-off with him after it appeared to be mooted by -year-old Harry’s family. Motorcyclist Harry died last August after a collision with American Anne Sacoolas, .  She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving but an extradition request was blocked by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Meanwhile, Prince Andrew was accused by a US lawyer of providing zero co-operation with an FBI probe into his paedophile former friend Jeffrey Epstein. A source close to the Duke of York - who denies wrongdoing - told thehe denied the claim and hadnapost been approached. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger told The Times this week that in the spirit of reciprocity, Anne Sacoolas shouldto the UK while Prince Andrew should also go to the US to ensure that justice is served there. But asked todaya “deal could be done”, Mr Raab said: There is no barter, itaposs a rules-based approach. Thataposs what the treaty does. We both see that the extradition treaty serves both sides. And we want to make it work. There is no haggle and no-oneaposs raised Prince Andrew. Frankly, no-one has ever raised that with me.  Speaking alongside Mr Raab on a UK visit, Mr Pompeo added: “I am confident each of these cases will be resolved on their relative merits. Mr Seiger later told the Mirror the familyaposs campaign would not stop. On the Prince Andrew suggestion he added: This is not a aposswapapos as is being discussed... but the concept of reciprocity is at the core of every extradition treaty. Despite Mr Raab saying no one had raised the idea, Mr Seiger claimed he personally did so in a meeting on Monday.  He said: I turned to him [Mr Raab] and I asked the question, what are our options. And I followed it on immediately by saying would you send Julian Assange and Prince Andrew therethey donapost send Anne Sacoolas back  And he said to me... aposI am reviewing all of my optionsapos. Mr Seiger added: Whether he heard me or not... you take the point. aposThey want Andrew, they want Assange, youaposre not going to have them unless you send Anne Sacoolasapos. Thataposs my job to ask him that question. The Foreign Office declined to comment further. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Raab both raised the Harry Dunn case with Mr Pompeo today.

Thataposs because under the deal agreed with the EU, the UK is in a apostransition periodapos. We will continue to follow EU rules until the end of the year. It is only after that date that there will be any major changes. If we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . If not, we could crash out on aposWTO termsapos - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. Thereaposs more detail below on the things that might change in January . Driving abroad  After January , a UK driving licence is still the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel in the EU. But after  January  you may need to get an International Driving Permit. There are three types - make sure you get the right one for the right country. A full list is  here. The £. documents were once a niche bit of paperwork but million a year are expected to be handed out. After  January  you also need to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance . Allow a month to get this from your insurance firm. You also need a GB bumper sticker as drivers currently needthey are driving on the continent. You must comply with all local driving regulations. Travel firms are insisting everything will remain the same for UK holidaymakers in the EU after January . That is because there will be no restrictions on travel to the EU until at least January . Queues of lorries at ports arenapost expected either because there will be no extra checks. But again, these could spring up in January  - especiallythere is no trade deal. The shape of the future relationship, trading checks or any travel restrictions is not yet established, and will be part of trade talks over the next  months.  It is in both the UK and the EUaposs interests to keep travel as smooth as possible because so many businesses and iniduals rely on it.But, as with all things, it will depend on the kind of relationship Boris Johnson is looking to negotiate.Passports and visas  Brits will not need a visa to travel to the EU after January . You can keep using EU passport gates at airports. UK government guidance says you wonapost need a visa from  January  either -youaposre a tourist. But you will have a limited stay of up to  days in any -day period, and you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer. You may also need to show aticket, show you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. From , Brits must also have at least six months left on their passportsgoing to the EU.  Your passport must also be no more than  years old, evenit has time left, from  January . Healthcare  Nothing changes from pm on Friday - but you should start preparing for . From the end of , the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. After that there will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare. Instead it is up to the UK to strike reciprocal health cover with inidual states - a sort of aposweaposll fund your peopleyou fund oursapos system. Back last year the UK and Spain struck an agreement to continue health cover until the end of there was no deal. One might expect a pact after that too, but for other countries itaposs less certain. Because of this, travellers from the UK to EU are being told to ensure they have adequate insurance for the full duration of their trip in  and beyond. For EU migrants to the UK,there is no reciprocal agreement, there is a £-a-year charge to use the health service. Pet owners can carry own bringing their beloved animals to the EU on apospet passportsapos until December. But they must prepare four months in advancethey are planning a holiday on or after  January .  Current advice for after January  is the animal must have a rabies vaccination, followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But to add an extra layer of red tape, this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. So you need to get your timing right. EU citizens  EU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for settled status, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Those who havenapost lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for pre-settled status, then again for settled status when they hit the five-year mark.  After  January , new EU citizens who want to come to the UK will be subject to a points-based immigration system. They will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary.

Four years ago an aggressive form of glaucoma also attacked his left eye, and although he underwent surgery to try and slow the disease, it was unsuccessful. Jonathan was left only being able to see shapes and shadows. Since being registered blind, he requires day-to-day assistance from his guide dog, Sam.And whilst Samaposs support is a vital leline for Jonathan, there are some thingaposs heaposs unable to do, which thankfully the apos Be My Eyesapos app can.The app helps to connect blind or low-vision users with volunteers that will be able to assist them with whatever they may need help with.He told UNILAD that some weeks - depending on his plans - he could call volunteers up to four times.He said: Be My Eyes can help me with what might seem to some people the most simple of tasks, such as identying dferent tins in the cupboard or finding specic shops on an unfamiliar street. But one volunteer last summer helped guide Jonathan to his dadaposs grave so he could lay some flowers.  Whilst he knew the general area of the grave, he said it would have been pretty much impossible for a blind person to do this without assistance. He continued: I held my phone in the direction of the gravestones, so as I walked along they were able to let me know when I got to my dad’s stone. Jonathan said the tool has made a real positive impact on his le, and just knowing the app is right there in his pocket is extremely reassuring. The app was launched in , and soon became one of the largest microvolunteering s in the world. Anyone can sign up to be a volunteer by simply downloading the app, and when a visually impaired user needs help, they place a call which gets sent to multiple volunteers. It almost works on a first come, first serve basis, as the first volunteer to accept the call, will be the person assisting - it all comes down to time zones and languages. A furniture craftsman from Denmark, Hans Jørgen Wiberg, is the founder of the app that now has more than .m volunteers helping , visually impaired users - and being visually impaired himself the app is very dear to his heart. The idea grew when a blind friend of his told him he was video calling his friends and family to help assist him with day to day tasks.

The evacuation flight to bring  Brits back will leave Wuhan City tonight and land Friday before passengers are then held in an NHS facility on the Wirral for a quarantine period of  days, the Foreign Secretary has said. This comes as the first person-to-person spread of coronavirus in the United States has been confirmed in Illinois. The flight is due to leave Wuhan city at am local time on Friday morning, which is pm on Thursday evening UK time. The flight will land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire where UK nationals will disembark. Fty foreigners - mainly from EU countries and thought to be Spanish - will also be on the evacuation flight which will head to Spain afterwards. The death toll from the virus has hit  and the outbreak has spread to  other countries.  In a statement, Dominic Raab said: We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at am local time on Friday  January.The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our Embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that a patient in Illinois has contracted the virus after their we from Chicago became the second confirmed case of coronavirus in the US.  The man, who is in his s, caught the virus after his we brought it back from Wuhan. He is in a good condition despite some existing medical conditions while his we is still in quarantine at a hospital. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told CNBC: This is a very serious public health situation. Moving forward, we can expect to see more cases, and more cases means more potential for person-to-person spread. Speaking at a Policy Exchange event in Westminster earlier, Mr Raab said officials in the Foreign Office had been working tirelessly to get citizens out of Wuhan. He added: Weaposve been working with the Department of Health flat out,  , to try and make sure we can identy British nationals in Wuhan, get them to a muster point and get them to a flight, a chartered flight in and out. The flight, which will have military medics on board, will land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Passengers will then be taken to an NHS facility - thought to be former NHS staff accommodation - on the Wirral for a quarantine period of  days.  The Liverpool Echo reported they would be taken to a former student accommodation block in the grounds of Arrowe Park Hospital. Janelle Holmes, chief executive of Wirral University Hospital, sent a message to staff on Thursday evening, saying: Around  British citizens will be travelling to the UK from China tomorrow. We will be welcoming and housing them in the accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hospital. Before arrival they will be screened for symptoms. If anyone becomes unwell after arrival they will be treated following appropriate protocols. It is understood passengers will have access to the internet and be able to make contact with family.There, they will have access to medical staff, and it is understood they will have the internet and be able to make contact with family. Fty foreigners - mainly from EU countries - will also be on the evacuation flight which will head to Spain afterwards.  Officials have been working to secure a flight out of Wuhan for British nationals after one planned for Thursday failed to get clearance from Chinese authorities. The Government anticipates flying out around  UK citizens who have been in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province. Kharn Lambert, whose grandmother Veronica Theobald, , from Lancaster, is hoping to leave Wuhan, said he was waiting for a confirmation email with flight details. The situation is basically we wonapost go to the airport until we receive the confirmation email, he said. Passengers say they have been told only to take hand luggage on the flight. Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, told the BBC his family faced a terrible dilemma after he and his nine-year-old daughter were told they could fly back - but not his Chinese we, who has a permanent residency visa for the UK. The Chinese government does not recognise dual nationality, and currently anyone with Chinese citizenship is not thought to be able to leave the affected area. PA understands that the Foreign Office is working hard to ensure families are kept together and close relatives with dual citizenship can leave on the flight.  British nationals have been asked to make their own way to the airport, and it is understood the British Consulate has provided letters to help people in cars get past security checkpoints. It comes as the World Health Organisationemergency committee could declare an international public health emergency during its meeting on Thursday. The WHO has said the whole world needs to be on alert over the new coronavirus outbreak. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director at the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said on Wednesday that the decision to reconvene was due to the increasing number of cases and evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus. The number of cases of coronavirus has jumped to ,, with  deaths.  India confirmed its first case on Thursday, as did the Philippines. In the UK,  people have tested negative for the virus as of Thursday. Of , passengers and  staff who arrived in the UK from Wuhan between January  and , some  have already left the UK and  are now outside the -day incubation period for the virus. Meanwhile, British Airways has extended its suspension of all flights to and from mainland China until Monday.

The pair were swept away on a tide of passion after striking up a friendship on Facebook.And Iris, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, has also insisted there is no way her young lover is after her money.The former cleaner lives on £-a-week pension and disability benefit.Meanwhile, speaking from his home in Giza, Mohamed admitted that most people have been skeptical, but when he finally met Iris, they fell into each otheraposs arms. He said: It’s not her appearance that interests me but what is inside. She has great mind and loving heart. It might seem a bit strange having a we who is  years older than your mother but that’s love.  Not wanting to go into too much detail about their sex le he added: We don’t talk about such things in Egypt, but it was very passionate and felt special holding such a wonderful soul.Grandmother Iris, was much less coy as she appeared on ITV yesterday morning, shocking daytime show hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Iris told the pair she felt like a virgin again before ulging further. The hosts were left stunned as she went on and continued describing their rough first sexual encounter and viewers were equally taken aback with what she had to say. She admitted: Nobody’s been near me for  years, I felt like a virgin again. We used a whole tube of KY jelly.  Speaking first to the Sunday Mirror, Iris said her family was concerned Mohamed was making a fool of her. Feisty Iris insists Mohamed isn’t after her money nor is he seeking a passport to Britain. She said: “If he’s marrying me for my fortune he’ll be sadly disappointed because I live on a pension. “I don’t suffer fools gladly. I’m honest and I’m truthful and I told him straight away he couldn’t be a freeloader.

Former church minister Doug Curry, , was celebrating his th wedding anniversary with a staycation with we, Margaret, and went to visit their favourite beach on July  last year. When they arrived at Sandymouth Beach in Bude, Cornwall, Mrs Curry went into the water with her body board and Mr Curry went to go string his hammock. But for some reason he picked a dferent spot to usual and strung his hammock in an area with dangerously unstable clfs - and a huge boulder fell right on top of him. The inquest heard he was killed almost immediately by the impact. Mrs Curry, from Gretham, Hampshire, told the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, she initially had no idea her husband had been killed until she saw the emergency services. In a statement she said she had met Mr Curry when she was just  at a Christian study group and they married when she was . The father-of-four went on to be a minister - a position from which he had only recently retired - and was given a green cloth hammock when he did. Mrs Curry said in her statement: “We left the campsite in the morning and went to get provisions. We arrived at the car park for Sandymouth Beach at .am. “Doug got out his tea making stove that he always took to the beach and I headed into the sea with my body board. “I ed from the water and saw that Doug had got his hammock out. He had used it for years. This one had been given to him when he retired so it was not that old.”  Mrs Curry said that whenever the couple visited the beach, her husband would use his green cloth hammock and he had attached it to a clf recently in Greece. It had two loops on either end and would be secured in place using ratchet straps similar to those used on lorries. She added: “He didn’tfor some time and I began to wonder where he had gone. “When I couldn’t see him anywhere obvious I called his name. I thought he must have been exploring. “I became aware of a search and rescue helicopter up the beach and I wondered why it was here.” Mrs Curry approached the scene and saw police officers there turning people away. She approached one to ask what was going on and after a brief interchange she learned it was her husband who had been involved in the incident. The widow said: “The officer ed and said my husband was dead. “I was in shock, I sat on a rock and started calling people to tell them what had happened. “He was not an adrenaline junky, he would always assess what he was doing andthere was a danger he would not do it. This was a terrible accident.”  The incident was witnessed by a beach user, Chris Latham, who also gave a statement that was read out at the inquest in Truro today. He said he saw Mr Curry above him on a clf face and thought he was in a precarious position, but ed to his family to look after his children. Then he heard a loud noise and turned to see a plume of dust in the air where Mr Curry was. Mr Latham added: “A rock the size of a hay bale was now in the area, I could not see the man but I could see an arm coming out from under the rock. “I could see the arm under the rock belonged to the man.” Mr Latham then approached to seehe could help. He added: “I could see his face, eyes and hands. There was a lot of blood on his face. “There was no movement to his face or hands.”  RNLI leguards who were on scene rushed to try and free Mr Curry. Giving evidence at the hearing, Josh Compton, leguard supervisor for the south-west, said he was notied of the incident by a member of the public and went over to help. He said: “A man was stuck under a boulder. He wasn’t breathing at that point. “The boulder was large, too large for us to move.” A post mortem revealed that Mr Curry had suffered multiple fractures, a ruptured trachea, and had obvious catastrophic chest trauma. The medical cause of death was recorded as catastrophic head trauma.

The sea animal was found at Carlyon Bay, where another dead dolphin calf was found just before Christmas.Julie Garrett sent the pictures to  Cornwall Live concerned after the smaller dolphin was found with a plastic bag in its mouth.She said: It was at Carlyon Bay in St Austell where the other two were found a month or so ago. They were not removed for ages. This one has been eaten by something as inners were hanging out. I donapost knowthis last one had been tagged as partly eaten. The tragic discovery was made on Thursday, December  and a seal was also reported to be washed up at around the same time.Christine Rosser, of St Austell, posted images of the marine animals on her Facebook page along with a “bit of a rant”.She said at the time: “We donapost all have to have our voices heard but we can all quietly do our bit to help the environment. I know some people do make the effort but on my beach walks I have only seen one other person pick up plastics, cans, etc and dispose of them in the bins provided. “Today the sea has washed up a seal and a dolphin. The seal may have been a victim of the storms but the dolphin had a plastic bag in its mouth.  “The beautul beach is free, as is the car park , and is enjoyed by dog walkers and beach treasure collectors, everyone could help. Rant over.” Christine, who takes her springer spaniel poodle cross Harvey to the beach three or four times a week, said: “It was a very upsetting sight – it was only a young dolphin. I told the beach’s security guard about the dolphin and the seal, and when I ed the next day both were still on the beach and tagged.” "},{"url":null,"title":"holy grail hoard 100 year","story":"w.mantis  Hidden away in a tatty box in lofts for  years, a horde of rugby union jerseys, described as the “holy grail” of the game, can at last be seen by the public.  nHistorian Peter Jones first set eyes on the collection in , while researching a book, and said: “It felt like the rugby version of finding and opening Tutankhamun’s tomb.”  nCharlie Pritchard, a First World War hero who died in the trenches in , collected the shirts while playing for Wales and Newport.  nThey include:  n  n A No New Zealand shirt from their first tour of Britain in , when they were given their All Blacks nickname.  n A  England shirt from the first ever game in Twickenham.  n Wales shirt from  season.  n  n  n Anthony Watson desperate to trade World Cup Final tears for Six Nations cheers  n Andy Farrell insists he is ready to lead after a letime preparing for role  nThe shirts now belong to Charlie’s great grandson Gareth Pritchard, who said: “I know they are priceless, but we will never sell them.  n“I see myself as the caretaker of this very special collection to look after and protect, and am honoured to be so.”  nNext week they will go on display at the World Rugby Museum in Twickenham, just after the start of the Six Nations on Saturday.  nCharlie kept shirts swapped after games, sometimes wearing them in charity games.

newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHidden away in a tatty box in lofts for  years, a horde of rugby union jerseys, described as the “holy grail” of the game, can at last be seen by the public. Historian Peter Jones first set eyes on the collection in , while researching a book, and said: “It felt like the rugby version of finding and opening Tutankhamun’s tomb.” Charlie Pritchard, a First World War hero who died in the trenches in , collected the shirts while playing for Wales and Newport. They include:A No New Zealand shirt from their first tour of Britain in , when they were given their All Blacks nickname. A  England shirt from the first ever game in Twickenham. Wales shirt from  season.The shirts now belong to Charlie’s great grandson Gareth Pritchard, who said: “I know they are priceless, but we will never sell them. “I see myself as the caretaker of this very special collection to look after and protect, and am honoured to be so.” Next week they will go on display at the World Rugby Museum in Twickenham, just after the start of the Six Nations on Saturday. Charlie kept shirts swapped after games, sometimes wearing them in charity games. After he died they were packed away by we Florence at their home in Newport, South Wales. Unwashed, they were handed down over the next  years.  Historian Peter, also an author, stumbled on the story of the shirts while researching a book on Newport Rugby Club. He said: “These shirts are the story of the birth of international rugby. It is an extraordinary find. “To hold the No New Zealand shirt from “The Originals” tour is spine-tingling. It has been a privilege to help bring them to light. They tell Charlie’s story – a story of a great sportsman and a great hero.” England legend Lawrence Dallaglio said: “This sounds incredible. What a find. It’s great they are going on show at Twickenham and the next time I am there I will certainly have a look.” Gareth, , an investment manager, from Wimborne, Dorset, said: “These jerseys have been stored in a cardboard box in lofts for decades. “Only after my move to the countryside recently did I place them in a plastic box as I was concerned about moths, rats or water damage.  “I wanted to make sure they were safe and secure, but they did remain in the loft – in hindsight, a good thing. It helped keep the colours of the shirts as good as they are after  years. “From a young age I knew that my great-grandfather had played rugby for Wales and that we had some international shirts and his Welsh cap. The jerseys were rarely seen, I recall just twice, once at a Pritchard family reunion held to view the shirts.” It was only when an All Blacks shirt from  went up for auction in  and a high value was put on it that he learned how precious the shirts were. He said: “When I met Peter Jones in  and opened the box, his enthusiasm about the jerseys was so exciting to me.  It was akin to being a child on Christmas morning, with each shirt a present and opening up the historical importance they held.” Peter has written “I Did My Bit”, a book about Captain Pritchard. The title refers to Charlie’s final words on his deathbed. In the Daily Mirror in , we quoted Company Sergeant Major Codling, who told how Charlie was shot as he tried to capture a German from the trenches, then stumbled back to his own side. Codling said: “He asked, ‘Have they got the Hun ’ and they said, ‘Yes’. He said, ‘Well, I have done my bit’.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA Lottery-winning NHS nurse who survived a cervical cancer scare has given birth to a miracle IVF baby, paid for with her winnings. Rebecca Brown pocketed a le-changing £, when her Mirror-reading family syndicate won the £million jackpot in August . But she was left devastated two years later when doctors found pre-cancerous cells of the cervix during a routine test. Rebecca, , was toldshe wanted children she should have them “sooner rather than later” amid hysterectomy fears. So she decided to spend a chunk of her National Lottery winnings on IVF treatment - and fell pregnant after two rounds. Rebecca is now celebrating the birth of daughter Ethel, who was born by caesarean section weighing lbs ozs last week. The orthopaedic nurse, who refused to quit her job despite the win, said her bundle of joy is “priceless”. She is being supported by her dad David, , mum Yvonne, , and sister Julie,  - the other three syndicate members. Rebecca told the Mirror: “When I won the Lottery I cried. I never thought I would use it to pay for fertility treatment, that’s for sure. “I never thought I’d be where I am now. It’s been a bit manic and full-on but totally worth it. “The day after she was born I was in a daze. I couldn’t believe she was my baby. I thought it was a dream I was going to wake up from. “I can’t put a value on Ethel. There is no value. She is priceless and worth every penny.” AskedEthel would have been born without the Lottery win, she said: “Ethel would probably be here, but not funded by myself.  “She would be here on contributions from mum, dad, sister. They would have helped me out. They know how important it was for me.” Rebecca, who works at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, had no plans to become a mum after her Lottery win.

Once the water is at its lowest at around .pm, the whaleaposs organs will begin to fail and toxins will be released into its body. Julia Cable, national coordinator at British Divers Marine Le Rescue - which is currently monitoring the animal - put its chances of its surviving at %. Itaposs stranded on a mud flat, she told MirrorOnline. Nature will take its course. We canapost save sperm whales. We canapost move them to deeper water. The coast guard are heading out there now, but the tide is now falling. It will die. I can be % sure. Because theyaposre such massive animals, their shear body mass cannot be supported without water. Toxins will leak into its body and then it will shut down. The whale is thought to be about ft long and was first seen swimming and spraying water in the air near Whitstable harbour It was reported to the HM Maritime and Coastguard by staff at The Bubble Cafe, on Whitstable seafront.  The outletaposs assistant manager Charlotte Bambridge told Kent Online: We look right out to sea, and he or she was quite close - sort of stuck in one position for quite a while. Then he moved slowly towards the harbour for about an hour, and he was spraying water in the air. Sperm whales rarely venture into the North Sea because their favoured food - giant squid - are not found in its waters. However, it is not unheard of for a sperm whale to become stranded off the British coast. A ft animal became beached off the coast of Northumberland in October. Earlier this month a ft male died close to Inverness in Scotland.  The sperm whale is the latest in a number of large sea creatures which have made it into the Thames Estuary in the last  months. In September  Benny the beluga whale was spotted near Gravesend, Kent and stayed resident in the waters for months before disappearing. In October last year Hessy the Humpback made headlines across the World after swimming up the River Thames as far Gravesend in Kent.

While the north east is being rocked by the hefty gusts, northern Scotland will get soggy under an evening of showers. In the south of England things are much more pleasant. Low cloud will do little to ruin an otherwise calm night in which unseasonable warm temperatures of around C will compliment a dry evening. On Friday the yellow weather warning will have been lted from the north east of England.  However, a wet front will work its way down from western Scotland and Northern Ireland towards the south east. At some point during the day rain will strike most parts of the UK. It is not all doom and gloom however.  The day will be brightened by unexpectedly high temperatures, peaking at around C in the south. Saturday will begin with the weather front hanging just off the south coast of England, meaning a few brief showers for those close to the sea.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTomorrow Britain closes the door on one chapter in our long history and opens the door to another.  For some this will be a moment of mourning, for others a time for celebration. A rupture as momentous as Brexit was always going to be isive and controversial.  No orce is easy.  The last three years have tested friendships, ided families and strained the bonds that bind us.  If the arguments were so passionate it was the because the issue was so important.  At stake is our future prosperity, security and place in the world. Some firms and industries will prosper, others could struggle.  People’s jobs and livelihoods will be affected.  There are some who even question whether the United Kingdom will survive as pressure grows for independence in Scotland and Northern Ireland finds itself on a dferent path from the British Isles.  This is not the moment to revisit the debate that has raged for the last three years.  At pm tomorrow we will leave the European Union and embark on a new era.  What happens next is ours to shape. We have to forge a new trade deal with the European Union.  Agreements on security, data sharing, fishing and aviation have to be revised and rewritten.  There will be years of extensive and sometimes dficult trade talks with dozens of other countries including the United States, India, Japan and Australia.  We must ensure there will be no watering down of labour laws, consumer and environmental protections and hard-won rights. Nor must there be any agreement that allows US health firms to plunder our National Health Service.  If the first stage of Brexit was fraught with frustrations the next few years could be even more testing and complex.  There is a danger that we conduct the battles ahead with the same acrimony that has characterised the debate since we voted to leave in June .  This paper recommended that we stay in the European Union but we have always recognised the democratic legitimacy of the referendum.  If the UK is to come together again, which it must, then it is time for those who lost the argument to stop fighting old battles and for those who won to reach out to the defeated.  Our national conversation has become too heated and too toxic.  The values once associated with Britain of tolerance, pragmatism and decency risk being swept away by a tide of furious finger pointing and point scoring.  We are saying goodbye to our relationship with the EU but we must not turn our back on our friends in Europe.

Majid Ali attacked Blythe Mason-Boyle as she got into her car after leaving the gym. The -year-old customer services assistant suffered a smashed skull and was left blind in one eye following the brutal barrage at pm on March  last year. Ali repeatedly smashed Blythe in the head after ambushing her in a bid to steal her Audi A in Sheldon, West Midlands. Detectives traced the stolen car within  hours and Ali - who was just  at the time - was identied as the prime suspect. A warrant was executed at his home and the hammer was found hidden underneath a sofa bed. He denied robbery, possession of an offensive weapon and wounding, but was found guilty following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Ali, now  of Sparkhill, Birmingham, was jailed for nine years today as police released shocking images of Blytheaposs blooded face. The ferocious attack left her with cuts across her face and a fractured eye socket. She now struggles to see clearly through one eye and also receives counselling to overcome the trauma of her ordeal. After the trial she said: This has been a challenging and frustrating ten months, but justice has been served. I would like to think this carries the message that under no circumstances is it ever justied to attack any vulnerable person for a materialistic object. I can finally move forward with a le thataposs been on hold and bring closure to this chapter. After the attack, Blythe posted pictures of her injuries on Facebook in a bid to warn others to take care while walking across car parks at night. She wrote: At around pm whilst leaving the gym I was attacked by two men with hammers for the sake of an Audi A. Ladies and Gents please all be extra vigilant when getting into your cars after dark. Take that extra bit of time to check your surrounding area and study the people around you. aposStay safe, You never know whataposs around the corner!

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA apossmart window posterapos which allows contactless donations to be made to the homeless has been installed for the first time on a British high street. Groundbreaking contactless technology is being trialled at Nationwideaposs Union Street branch in Bath, Somerset - which could revolutionise charitable donations. Each simple tap donates £ directly to homeless people in the area, with users being able to pay multiple times per visit. The trial, which raised £ in its first week, comes as the building society continues to invest millions in branches up and down the country to support communities. It is hoped the initiative will make it easier for people to donate money, in addition to instilling confidence in those who feel uncomfortable giving cash directly to homeless people. The aposGood Start Tap to Donateapos scheme, which is managed by local homeless charity Julian House, was developed with Nationwide Building Society and Bath Business Improvement District. All money raised will go towards the Julian House Good Start fund, which will help improve and eradicate homelessness in Bath and North East Somerset. Nationwide branch manager Stephanie Pritchard said: A contactless point in the window of the branch has bridged the gap at a time when many people donapost have spare change or may not wish to hand it directly to someone who is homeless. As a branch we are very much here for the community. This novel way of raising money for a fantastic cause is a great example of how technology is playing a role in helping society, one tap at a time. As a payment method, contactless usage continues to rapidly rise.During  the number of contactless payments made in the UK increased by  per cent, to . billion payments, according to a UK Finance report. Other charities and not-for-profit organisations, including The Big Issue, have also recently turned to contactless payments as a way of securing revenue.

But one thing that appears to be able to heal the deepest rts is a common enemy - and nothing can bring us together like the power of food. Itaposs an unwritten rule that Brits can criticise their homeland as much as they want, butanyone  has a pop itaposs simply not on. That sentiment extends to our few but untouchable national treasures, including Sir David Attenborough, sausage rolls and pigs in blankets. So when New York Magazine made an unforgivable error in its piece about pigs in blankets, it was time to unite. Ahead of Sundayaposs Super Bowl in Florida, the publication wrote an article naming our cosy porky pals as the best food to feast on during the game, describing them as the aposTom Hanks of party snacks universally beloved. Theyaposre unassuming, inoffensive, yet somehow still a joy to beholdapos. Clearly no issue here. Although for many pigs in blankets are a sacred Christmas time food, we hardly need an excuse to break them out for the second time in two months. The problem is, New York Magazine tweeted the article with a photo of hot dog sausages wrapped in pastry. We wish we were joking. Thataposs not a pig in blanket, thataposs a sausage roll. And itaposs fair to say it didnapost go unnoticed by Brits who decided to respond to the article in the only way we know how - sarcasm. For others the red mist had already descended and it was too late. One simply snapped back: That’s a sausage roll you wrong ‘uns. Another wrote: Heathens. Those are sausage rolls. But many found comfort in the rage, as one said: Nothing, and I repeat nothing, will bring this nation back together like the outrage at this headline photo combo.

A husband and we from Macau were isolated in separate rooms on the Costa Smeralda after the -year-old woman came down with a fever and breathing dficulties on Wednesday night during a seven-day Mediterranean cruise. The coupleaposs preliminary results came back negative after they were tested for the SARS-like virus, which has killed at least  people in China and infected more than , others. There are about  Chinese nationals on the Smeralda, including the Macau woman, who was isolated in shipaposs hospital with flu-like symptoms, and her husband, who didnapost have any signs of the virus and was in isolation as a precaution. Are you on board the Costa Smeralda  Email webnews@mirror. Holidaymakers were held on board for more than eight hours while the vessel docked at a port in Civitavecchia, north-west of Rome, on Thursday with an estimated , passengers and , crew. The Chinese couple arrived at Milanaposs Malpensa Airport on Saturday on a flight from Hong Kong and then travelled about  miles to the port of Savona, where they boarded the Smeralda the same day. The ,-ft long ship had made previous stops this week in Mallorca, Barcelona and Marseille en route back to Italy. Doctors from the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases boarded the vessel, which was locked down until the results came back.  Passengers, who were meant to go on a day trip to Rome, feared everyone would be forced to undergo medical screening. The ship was due to leave Civitavecchia at pm local time and arrive in Savona on Saturday. One crew member who disembarked the ship on Tuesday evening and travelled to Germany was sent home from work and told to stay there until further notice, the Mirror understands.  Gaby, a passenger from Argentina who was trapped on the ship, tweeted: Arriving in Rome on the Costa Smeralda cruise ship and they are not letting us get off the boat. They say there is a sanitary inspection.  We have gone  hours without information. She later wrote: The captain of the Costa Smeralda says that, because of the #coronavirus, the sanitary controls in the ports will be more exhaustive. Speaking from the vessel before the test results came back, Gaby told : We are worried. We have no information. We donapost know what will happen next oreveryone will have to be screened. Italian passenger Filippo Rossi, , posted photos of tired travellers sat on the floor and in dining or common areas as they waited for updates. None are wearing masks.  Another snap shows police officers stood on the dock. Mr Rossi, from Rome, wrote: Meanwhile in Civitavecchia we are stuck in Costa ship without knowing the reason . He told : People are mostly tired. We are worried because officially on board crew say nothing about. They talk about aposnormalapos controls. We donapost know when weaposll disembark the ship. Mr Rossi and another passenger, Marina Guerrero, , said British citizens were on board the Smeralda.  Ms Guerrero, from Badalona, Spain, said passengers were left in the dark after the Chinese holidaymaker fell ill. She posted a video showing a passenger wearing a mask as tourists were gathered on one of the outdoor deck areas. She said: We have no information about what is happening. All we know is what has been posted on the internet. Everything is normal on board. Serge Simard, from Saint-Jerome, near Montreal, in Canada, told : Everything is calm. Too bad they cancelled our tour to Rome. They said the sanitary inspection should last  minutes. That was around .am. Then once every  or  minutes we received an update saying to wait. Then at .pm they cancelled our tour to Rome. I personally learned why reading the news online. Mr Simard, , said he wasnapost worried about coronavirus, adding: Seems like the people we have met are enjoying their vacations, so are we. We may be more careful where we put our hands, washing often and never touch our face, things like that, but what can we do   No-one was being allowed off the ship while medical checks were carried out to seethe Chinese couple had the potentially deadly coronavirus, a Costa Cruises spokesman said. There was anger over the cancelled trip to Rome, but boredom didnapost appear to be a problem for many. Passenger Maria Cartagena tweeted a photo of holidaymakers in a swimming pool. She wrote: All normal on board #costasmeralda awaiting evidence of #coronavirus to passengers of Asian origin. Ship locked in #civitavecchia.  Earlier, she wrote: Does anyone know how long it takes for tests to detect it  They are doing checks on  Chinese passengers and for nowthey donapost tell us anything . A bit of burden. Another passenger, from France, tweeted: What do we do now   hours waiting to go on an excursion with  announcements to say that these are aposnormal checksapos,that were the case you would have anticipated and we would already be in Rome on an excursion. Where is the travel info  On board of #CostaSmeralda, few announcements from @costacroisieres, waiting since : this morning to find out who, why, how ... meanwhile we have more info here [on Twitter] than on board. The situation is delicate of course but leaving passengers in a fog is unacceptable. There are  Chinese nationals on the Smeralda, including  who boarded in Savona with the Macau woman and her husband, Ansa reported. The seven-night cruise began at Civitavecchia on the evening of January  with stops in La Spezia the following day and in Savona, where the Chinese couple boarded, last Saturday. From there it stopped in Marseille on Sunday, Barcelona on Monday and Mallorca on Tuesday before heading back to Civitavecchia.  A Costa Cruises spokesman said earlier: Costa Cruises confirms the sanitary protocol has been activated for a guest on board Costa Smeralda. The guest, a -year-old lady of Chinese nationality, has been in isolation in the on board hospital since last night together with her travel mate, in line with health protocols. As soon as the suspected case was detected, the medical team on board immediately activated all the relevant health procedures to promptly isolate and manage the clinical condition. The Health Authority has been immediately notied and is now on board to conduct all the pertinent measures.  It is our utmost priority to ensure the health and safety of passengers and crew. The company is at complete disposal of the Health Authority and their indication will be strictly applied.  Costa Cruises continue to apply the relevant national policies and epidemic developments, as per World Health Organisation and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indications. Costa Smeralda reached Civitavecchia this morning, coming from Palma de Mallorca. The ship is operating seven-day cruises in West Med, including Civitavecchia, La Spezia, Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca. As passengers were held on board, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government was ready to take further stepsnecessary, but did not elaborate. Weaposre not concerned, but we are absolutely vigilant and cautious in facing this prospect, he told reporters during a trip to Bulgaria. Ernesto Tedesco, mayor of Civitavecchia, told TRC Giornale: There is a suspected case of coronavirus at the port of Civitavecchia.  Before the rest results came back, the Harbour Masteraposs Office said the situation was under control. Vincenzo Leone, a commander of the Lazio coastguard, told la Repubblica: We are waiting for the outcome of the checks still in progress, but everything that needed to be done has been done. The situation is under control and at the moment, there is no reason for concern on board. The brand new ship, which made its inaugural voyage in December, has a maximum capacity for just over , passengers and , crew. Costa Cruises announced on Thursday that it was cancelled nine cruises from China due to the outbreak. Health experts have expressed fears that Chinese holidaymakers could spread the virus during journeys abroad.  It can take days for symptoms to appear and doubts have been cast on the effectiveness of screening measures at airports. Like other respiratory infections, coronavirus is transmitted between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. It has an incubation of between one and  days, and there are signs it may spread before symptoms show. Symptoms can include a fever, cough and breathing dficulties, and it can lead to pneumonia and other potentially deadly complications. As of Thursday morning, the virus has killed at least  people and infected more than , others during the outbreak in China.

The map shows locations where cases have been reported in China and more than  other countries around the world. So far, the flu-like virus has killed at least  people in China and infected more than , others, mainly in central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan. About  Britons who are trapped in the city of  million will be quarantined at a UK military base for  days once the Chinese authorities finally allow them to leave. Do you have a spot on the repatriation flight  Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The live map was created by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the US. Outside of China,  confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand,  in Japan and  in Singapore. Australia has seven, France and the US have five each, and Germany has four. The UK has not had a confirmed case yet, although health experts have warned that the virus is likely already here.  More than  people have been tested in Britain, but all results have come back negative. Johns Hopkinsapos live map uses data from the World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control. Prof Lauren Gardner, who helped to create the map, said: “We built this dashboard because we think it is important for the public to have an understanding of the outbreak situation as it unfolds with transparent data sources.  “For the research community, this data will become more valuable as we continue to collect it over time.” Britain aposmost at risk of outbreak in Europeapos Meanwhile, experts at Southampton University have found that a coronavirus outbreak is more likely in Britain than any other country in Europe. The UK is on the front line in the battle against the killer disease - owing to the number of Chinese visitors.  More than , tourists arrive in London alone between January and the middle of March every year. Researchers at Southampton University measured the potential global spread for the first time, finding the UK was the most at-risk nation on the continent. Globally, it was ranked th, after the USand Australia- with London the th most vulnerable city across the world. Thailand, which has the most cases outside of China as of Thursday morning, topped the list of countries most at risk.

And a home win over Dunfermline shows their form in Inverclyde is just as good as it’s ever been.Morton finding their feet both home and away makes what is always a dficult trip an even stfer test for Dundee.Win and their quest for consistency starts anew – lose and the Dee and McPake could be staring down the barrel."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19798931-897x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 2 hibs appere solo goal earns united cup replay","story":"Louis Appere earned Dundee United a Scottish Cup fourth-round replay as they twice came from behind to draw with Hibs.Christian Doidge gave the Hibees a dream start after eight minutes at Tannadice before Lawrence Shankland scored a classy equaliser in first-half stoppage time.Martin Boyle put the visitors back in front with a powerful drive on  minutes before substitute Appere curled home a leveller on  minutes which earned the Terrors an Easter Road replay and a place in the hat for the last- draw.United showed five changes from the team which faced Partick last weekend with Jamie Robson, Calum Butcher, Ian Harkes, Peter Pawlett and Paul McMullan coming in for Adrian Sporle, Declan Glass, Nicky Clark, Louis Appere and Mark Reynolds.It was Pawlett#s first start for almost three months, with McMullan and Harkes seeing their first action since the last Dundee derby.What had been billed as the tie of the round got off to a frenetic start. And it was the visitors who almost took the lead after three minutes. However, Mark Connolly was in the right place at the right time to clear Florian Kamberi#s effort off the line.Hibs weren#t to be denied five minutes later, though, as they opened the scoring through a low Doidge effort. Slipped in by former Dundee man Boyle, the Welsh hitman coolly slotted under Benjamin Siegrist for -.On  minutes, straight from a United corner, the Hibees broke. Boyle was again the creator-in-chief, with his surging run into the Terrors# half leaving United back pedalling before Melker Hallberg saw his shot foiled by Siegrist.Kamberi again fired towards his fellow-countryman just before the half-hour but this time it was an easy save for United#s Swiss stopper.The Tangerines were struggling to get a foothold in the match and had created few chances as proceedings approached the half-way point. When Liam Smith found Harkes at the edge of the box to fire in a fairly innocuous shot, however, the mood seemed to lt around Tannadice.On  minutes, Siegrist again halted a deflected Kamberi effort from a matter of yards as the Hibees continued to press. United were starting to enjoy more possession, though, and went in at half-time with the tie level thanks to Shankland#s th domestic goal of the season.In the last of three minutes of added time at the end of the first period, Harkes strolled through the heart of the Hibs defence before sliding in Shankland to slot home from eight yards despite being under heavy pressure.United weren#t level for long, though, as two minutes into the second period the men from Edinburgh were back in the lead.Scott Allan played provider as he laid in Boyle to drive home low beyond an outstretched Siegrist from fully  yards.Kamberi#s battle with Siegrist continued on  minutes with the goalie again denying the striker#s thunderbolt from distance with the rebound just evading Boyle on the follow-up.Allan fired over just after the hour as the Terrors, again, fell out of the game as boss Robbie Neilson ordered their first change of the afternoon, sending Appere on for Pawlett.And young attacker Appere had the desired impact  minutes after coming on, picking up possession on the left before twisting and turning away from Steven Whittaker and then David Gray to curl a delightful effort beyond the helpless Ofir Marciano for -.Both teams pushed for a winner in the closing  minutes, with Siegrist pulling off a top save from Doidge in injury time, but it never came, meaning these two will have to do it all again a week on Tuesday in the capital.Dundee United : Siegrist , Smith, Watson, Connolly, Robson Harkes , Butcher , Powers McMullan, Shankland, Pawlett .Subs not used: Deniz, Sporle, Reynolds, Sow and King.Hibs : Marciano , Naismith , Porteous , Hanlon , Stevenson Hallberg, Allan, Whittaker Boyle, Doidge, Kamberi.Subs: Bogdan , Slivka, Newell, Horgan and Shaw.Ref: Kevin Clancy.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e32a193a66212.99925684-558x372.jpg ","title":"exclusive dundee city council worker sacked over email tampering claims","story":"A high-profile Dundee City Council education officer has been sacked over claims he sent a ‘falsied email’ during the tendering process for a £, local authority contract.Kenny Christie, education support officer for arts and culture with the council, was hauled in front of council chiefs earlier this month over claims he interfered in the tendering process to provide sound technology for Dundee Schools Musical Theatrefor three shows last summer.Mr Christie, who worked for the council for the past  years, has strenuously denied the allegations and has confirmed he will be appealing against the decision.He was previously director with DSMT but has since left the company, which is funded by the council.The allegations centre on Blue Parrot Production and Events, based in Edinburgh.It is understood Blue Parrot missed the tender deadline for the DSMT contract and, when an email from the company was forwarded to the tender team, the date had been tampered with to make it look like it had been submitted on time.But Mr Christie has denied all links to the scandal and said: “I received a letter from Dundee City Council today, January .“I can confirm that I am not currently working for Dundee City Council in any capacity.“I have been removed from my post.“The council has accused me of deliberately forwarding a falsied email. There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone.

I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c519197883d69.98930876-376x564.jpg ","title":"eyes opened to vegan lifestyle","story":"I feel asI hadn’t even heard of veganism until recently – and now it’s everywhere.The practice of not eating meat, fish or dairy sounds extreme but I’m amazed at how widespread it is.In my head, it’s a fad or the domain of health nuts and trendy types but my eyes were opened last week while travelling away with Homes Under The Hammer.At breakfast in my budget hotel in Wolverhampton, I sat next to a table of lorry drivers.When one of them asked the waitressshe had an alternative to cow’s milk for his cereal, it sparked a conversation in which he said he’d been vegan for a year or so.Rather than give their pal a ribbing for not eating sausages, they commended him for keeping it up – and one of the men said he was trying to cut down on dairy and meat.A stop-off for lunch at Greggs and I opted for the vegan sausage roll which I’d had once before and marvelled at how tasty it was.

The blaze was described in council reports as #catastrophic# with #around % of teaching rooms signicantly damaged#.Mr Alexander said: #There is a real need for improvement in the east of the city.#We have spent £m since  and invested in new schools and that is not including the £m spent on existing schools.#But we cannot afford to build two brand new schools.#The plan,we get agreement for a full consultation, is to merge Craigie and Braeview Academy.#We are looking at what happened in Fe after a fire when there was a merger with a college. We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process. And as a parent your focus is absolutely on what is in the best interests of your children.#Part of the consultation process will be looking at proposals for Craigiebarns to be part of the catchment area for Grove. That would take effect from August , so again there is a lead in time to give people the time to give feedback.#He told how boundaries are to be changed to help accommodate the uneven mix of schools which are under capacity and those which are over capacity both in primary and secondary.Turning his attention to the over side of the city, Mr Alexander said: #The re-alignment catchment areas for Harris Academy would remove Invergowrie and they would go to school in Perth.#Meanwhile, the future of a  much-vaunted new primary is also hanging in the balance — at least in the short-term.The council leader hinted that he understood that was likely to be a controversial decision.#We have also had a very detailed analysis of how many pupils in the area of Western Gateway and which schools they go to,# Mr Alexander continued.#There are  pupils on site , but we need to address the other issues with the priority being at the east end of the city, so Western Gateway is not a priority. This is not the time to do it and we cannot construct a primary school on the basis of  pupils.#We are not saying no to the school, but it is just not the right time now.

All week we’d been really positive so we need to go back and build on that for the next game.“I think I showed them my game – bit of pace, drop the shoulder and get a ball into the box.“Cutting in and having a shot as well, that’s the type of player I am.“I’d been playing with the U s at Wigan, Dundee came down to watch me in the Liverpool game a couple of weeks back.“I done well, we won the game and that’s where the interest came from. I’m really happy to be here.“I don’t know much about Scotland or the league but I know it’s a really competitive ision.“Hopefully, I can make an impact by getting a few goals and assists.” vw, px\"  Although not clued up on the Scottish game, Crankshaw is no stranger to the blood and thunder approach having cut his teeth in non-league football after being released by home town club Preston North End and then Morecambe.His route to Dens Park has taken in such footballing-hotbeds as Ramsbottom United, Clitheroe, Colne and Curzon Ashton but Crankshaw believes that has made him the character he is today.“My pathway has been dferent to a lot of other players but I think it shows that I’m hard-working, dedicated and just want to play football really,” he added.“Most people come through the youth ranks but I’ve went my way and it’s a little bit dferent.“Hopefully, I can get where I want to be and have a career in the game. I’ve seen the worst of it but I think that builds you and carves your career.“It builds you as a player to not take anything for granted. You can drop out of the game but,you work hard, you can make it back.”Given their toils of late in the Championship, Crankshaw believes that drive to turn things around is something the Dark Blues can employ to get their season back on track.“We need to find some consistency. I think we’ve definitely got the squad to go and push for promotion.“We need to put a run of games together and get back to winning, where Dundee should be.”He has been made to feel at home in Dundee despite not knowing many people, and is even flat-sharing with back-up goalkeeper Calum Ferrie, as he gets used to the city’s football culture.“All the squad have been really good with me, introducing me to everyone.“I came up late Thursday night and the manager met me. He’s been really good with me.“Everyone’s made me really welcome so, hopefully, we can get back to being confident and up there. We’re willing and I think we will do.“I don’t know many of the lads but they’ve all been really welcoming so it’s been really good.“I’m friends with Cal so I’m staying with him in the flat so he’s been making me tea and stuff! He’s been good with me and helping me to settle in.“Staying in Dundee has been good, I couldn’t believe it when I saw the two stadiums and how close they are.“It’s a really nice city, I haven’t seen much of it but, hopefully, I can get to know it.“Hopefully, we can go get a few goals, a few wins and put the points back on the board.“We can build from that and, once we get one, I think they’ll come. Once we get the confidence up, the mood in the camp should improve.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"recall-glasgows-great-food-hotspots","story":"GLASWEGIANS love their scran ndash and in recent decades, thanks in part to flourishing Finnieston and the magnicent Merchant City, the city is finally gaining a reputation as a fantastic foodie haven."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-marlene-glasgow-messages-mum","story":"WHEN he was a wee boy, growing up in Townhead, Bill Henderson loved a visit to Lewisrsquos department store."},{"url":null,"title":"influence-friars-glasgow-bishop-wisharts-arrival","story":"As we have begun to see, it is impossible to understate the importance of the Christian Church to the development of Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"sad-day-city-favourite-closed-doors","story":"WHEN Dinorsquos Italian restaurant closed its doors, it was a sad day for many Glasgow Times readers."},{"url":null,"title":"screechy-boards-steamed-pudding-kelvinside-academy-memories","story":"GUY ROBERTSON, AD AGENCY BOSS"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-launches-2020-programme","story":"Across  days, Glasgow will host  World premieres  European premieres,  UK premieres and  Scottish premieres at this years Glasgow Film Festival."},{"url":null,"title":"landmark-gallery-sell-off-budget-options","story":"CLOSING a museum housed in one of Glasgowrsquos most famous landmarks and selling off the building has been raised in a council budget cuts paper."},{"url":null,"title":"go-ahead-glasgow-harbour-shopping-outlet","story":"MAJOR plans for a new Clydeside retail outlet ndash including shops, restaurants and a cinema ndash have been given the green light."},{"url":null,"title":"post-malone-announces-glasgow-green-show-summer","story":"US superstar Post Malone will play the citys Glasgow Green."},{"url":null,"title":"cast-celebrate-25th-anniversary-debut-album-glasgow-show-swg3","story":"INDIE stars Cast will play a show in the citys West End later this year."},{"url":null,"title":"netflixs-the-staircase-star-david-rudolf-coming-glasgow-q-event","story":"A Netflix star and the lawyer in the centre of one of the most controversial and long-running murder cases is coming to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"east-renfrewshire-councils-consultants-recommend-turning-eastwood-park-allotments-car-park","story":"COUNCIL bosses have been looking at plans that would rip up a thriving allotment site... and replace it with a car park."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-credit-50m-loan-cash-clawback","story":"MORE than pound million has been ldquoclawed back by the DWP from Universal Credit payments in just one month to cover loans given because of a five-week wait."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-hold-bus-control-rally-outside-glasgow-city-chambers","story":"BETTER buses now.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

from harm.\"Therefore adults in charge of children will be allowed to have one alcoholic drink and a further alcoholic drink with a sit-down meal.\"It has been a crime since  to be drunk in charge of a child under the age of seven in a public place.The offence can be punished by a fine or up to a month in jail.A Wetherspoonspokesman said: \"The manager took the decision to put the poster in the pub to emphasise to customers that she would not allow parents to drink while their children were running round uncontrolled in the pub.\"The notice had a positive effect, with mostly good feedback.\"Wetherspoonadded: \"There is a guideline, though not a policy, that we will serve the adult a maximum of two alcoholic drinks with their meal.\"The reason is that we dont want children being unruly in the pubs and parents thinking they can continue to drink while this happens.\""},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-students-given-final-go-ahead-high-school-return","story":"STUDENTS from

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way.

They are able to catch and release Atlantic salmon, and they are able to catch and retain sea trout, should they catch them.ldquoBut at the moment, because of the way in which we grade the rivers and because of the grading of some of the rivers in that estuary, they are not able to retain the salmon.Mr Main made the comments while giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee.He was questioned on possible exemptions for the haaf netters by Scottish Labour MSP Claudia Beamish, who represents the South of Scotland region.She suggested the ancient technique kills less fish because it doesnrsquot use hooks, adding: ldquoTherefore, is it not possible that the haaf netters could keep fish  Is that something yoursquove looked into Dr John Armstrong, director of Marine Scotlandrsquos Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, said he could ldquosee the logic to this.He told MSPs: ldquoThere wouldnrsquot necessarily be a need to take the fish out of the water, which is one of the key issues.ldquoBut anglers typically only catch in the order of  per cent of fish moving up-stream.ldquoAnd now, even of that % theyrsquore releasing %, in that order.ldquoSo therersquos very little damage from catch and release in angling, just by those numbers.ldquoIn terms of where we have rivers that are in poor conservation status, we really just donrsquot want fish killed Irsquom afraid.The Annan Haaf Net Project has been documenting those who still brave the icy waters with their nets, while the Devilrsquos Porridge Museum in Eastriggs, Dumfries and Galloway, is currently staging an exhibition on the practice.Haaf netter Barry Turner recently told the BBC: ldquoIt would be an act of vandalism, cultural and historic vandalism,this traditional activity which is unique to the inner Solway dies.ldquoPlease save us, wersquore desperate for protection. Wersquore unique, wersquore only  people.

Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnt built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-comedy-festival-host-first-dementia-friendly-gig-elderly-described-stand-up-inaccessible","story":"Lynsey Neilson, Dementia Development Manager of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, which provides a range of services for older people, asked clients and families what they would like to see added to the programme.Many elderly people said they had enjoyed comedy but felt it was ldquonot always accessible for older people, particularly those with dementia or restricted mobility.Gigs tend to be held at night, in dimly lit and licensed basement clubs or venues without lts, while Lynsey who does stand-up ldquoas a hobby said routines that feature a lot of audience interaction or swearing may not be suitable for someone with dementia while reactions to certain types of humours might be unpredictable.The free but ticketed gig, which is now sold out, will be held during the day in the Fred Paton Centre, run by the charity in Glasgowrsquos West End.Sets will be kept to a maximum of seven minutes with frequent breaks and the family-friendly comedy wonrsquot feature any swearing or crowd participation.

They will explore the rich history and stories associated with it, through which it became a beacon of the Enlightenment and leading centre for the arts.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming visitors, local and from all over the world, to enjoy these events and help celebrate this fantastic anniversary.The story of Greyfriars Bobby emerged in the latter half of the s after he became something of a local celebrity in the capital. The dog was said to be the pet of John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a nightwatchman, and stayed in Greyfriars Kirk for almost a decade and a half after Mr Gray died, living near his grave.The tale has gone on to inspire both books and films, and a statue of the dog at the corner of Candlemaker Row and the George IV Bridge, remains a popular visitor spot for tourists.The graveyard is also a place of pilgrimage for Harry Potter fans, after author JK Rowling revealed that some of the names on the gravestones had filtered into her novels, while the setting also resembles the cemete ry where the boy wizardrsquos parents are buried.Besides its active congregations, worshipping in Gaelic and English, the kirk contributes to a flourishing local community in central Edinburgh through creating communities of support, social enterprise and wellbeing at the Grassmarket Community Project and the Greyfriars Charteris Centre.The church has links to the Covenantersrsquo early days as the defenders of Presbyterianism against any encroaches by the Catholic faith during the turbulent s. The original ldquocovenant establishing this intent was signed at Greyfriars Kirk in .Inspired by renowned figures from the Enlightenment who lie in the Kirkyard, or who were ministers of Greyfriars, a Festival of Science, Wisdom and Faith will be held between - June featuringa line-up including forensic anthropologist Dame Sue Black and writer Richard Holloway.A series of talks and  will encourage the public to reflect on the tension that has often existed between science, wisdom and faith and whether this has changed in the modern era. A new book by local historian Roy Pinkerton has been launched to coincide with the  years exploring the history of the  churches, which have united to form the present-day Greyfriars congregation.In September there will be a spectacular flower festival which will see the building filled with colourful displays paying tribute to the rich history of the  churches.Musical highlights include a performance of the Renaissance masterpiece Spem in Alium by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra Chorus, led by the conductor Gregory Batsleer on  February.During Lent, in a joint concert, the Dunedin Consort and Scottish Ensemble will perform Sir James Macmillanrsquos Seven Last Words from the Cross on March .Edinburgh Royal Choral Union plans a special commission for choir, soloist and organ from composer Thomas LaVoy November .

Indeed, we need to cancel the phrase lsquoWe need to have a conversation.rsquo What we need is to let people breathe.And we need to assume women are perfectly capable of forming conversations, and indeed cover subject matter that involves more than the anodyne.I can recall women in our office once introducing that age-old talker lsquoHow much money would you want to sleep with so-and-so,rsquo chat, and of course it was fun ndash and revealing ndash to discover how little money was involved to get intimate with the office horrors.

when there is serious consideration being given to building bridges and tunnels between the islands and the mainland which would make ferries obsolete.This would, of course, be great news for islanders as they would no longer be left at the mercy of the weather or a ferry mal to make hospital or business appointments.It would also be great for the islands economy as more people would

The more popular ones can even generate money for the local community.ldquoThe trouble is that many people who break into coin-operated machines, especially in rural areas where you are less likely to be seen, often do so to buy drugs. Making them cashless eliminates that problem. These machines are pretty robust too.ldquoThere is also the potential for the appropriate authorities to use the information on the use of the customerrsquos card to track missing persons or those with dementia.ldquoPeople use a credit card for many small payments these days ndash such as a cup of coffee, why not also to go the toilet  It also removes the problem of getting stuck without a coin when you are desperate to answer a call of nature.He said half of all the toilets in north east Lincolnshire are now card only.ldquoItrsquos the way its going, he added.ldquoSome people may baulk at a p charge, but when public toilets took off  years ago, the fee was p, which is well over that in todayrsquos money.However some users on social media were bemused by their introduction in the Highlands ndash though most broadly welcomed the change.ldquoI think its shocking, buttheyrsquore looked after and kept clean I donrsquot grudge paying.

After Members of the European Parliament voted to back the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, they sang Auld Lang Syne, Robert Burns’ version of an old Scottish folk song about friendship, as a way to bid goodbye to the United Kingdom.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted George Eliot, saying “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love”, and told the UK that “we will always love you and we will never be far”. Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “It’s sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given us so much: culturally, economically, politically, even its own blood, in two world wars. It’s sad to see the country leaving that liberated Europe twice.”The outpouring of goodwill was palpable and obviously genuine.: Watch: MEPs belt out Auld Lang Syne as European Parliament backs Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament bodyIn contrast, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage expressed the hope that the UK’s departure would be the beginning of the end for the EU. “It’s a bad project. It isn’t just undemocratic, it’s anti-democratic,” he claimed, ignoring the fact that Britain was leaving as a result of a democratic process.The vision of the world espoused by Farage, Donald Trump and other members of what some call the alt-right and others view as the far-right is of entirely separate nations in a state of constant struggle. So Trump, the US President who puts ‘America first’, makes trade war on countries who dare to act in their own interests. After France planned a new tax on tech giants, who pay infamously little, Trump threatened vast tarfs on its goods.If the EU collapsed and populist leaders in the Trumpian mould emerged across the continent, all promising to put one over rival countries with dferent agendas, how long would it be before those trade wars turned into something more serious The EU has helped keep the peace in Europe for a letime after millions died in two horrendous world wars. And the fact that the UK and Ireland were both members meant those who were prepared to commit murder in Northern Ireland’s Troubles began to look as foolish as they were callous and brutal.There are legitimate criticisms to be made of the EU and it should take Brexit as a sign of the need for reform.

This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2719899.jpg--.jpg?1580378297000\n","title":"my top 10 artie mcauley s musical memories","story":"THE next rambler on our new musical meander down memory lane is the inimitable Mr. Artie McAuley.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

wanted with the EU- and the United States.Askedhe thought Brexit had brought a united Ireland any closer, Mr Corbyn said: “Clearly the issue that is important at the moment is one of dealing with the immediacy of funding and trading arrangements.”He highlighted that many major companies in Northern Ireland relied on European trade.“They need to know they have a future and I think that’s a more important priority than anything ,” he said.“The Prime Minister promised that there would be no border down the Irish Sea and then, as was revealed during the General Election debates, that it’s quite clear there’s going to be some kind of tarf arrangement.“The Prime Minister must clary this.  data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Mr Corbyn meeting Assembly speaker Alex Maskey at Stormont \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Mr Corbyn meeting Assembly speaker Alex Maskey at Stormont \" width\"\" \"\"  Mr Corbyn meeting Assembly speaker Alex Maskey at Stormont “If he wants a trade agreement with Europe — which he says he does — then they are not going to allow a trade arrangement with Britain which automatically undercuts consumer and environmental rights compared to Europe, while at the same time he is trying to do a trade arrangement with Donald Trump’s USA, who are moving in entirely the opposite direction.”He added that the Prime Minister “still does not have an answer to the many questions raised by businesses and workers in Northern Ireland about the future trading relationship with the Republic, Britain and the rest of Europe”.“It’s time for Boris Johnson to make up his mind.” During his visit Mr Corbyn — who has often been criticised for his sympathies with militant Irish republicanism — met representatives of Assembly parties, describing the meetings as “informative”.There were, of course, no Labour MLAs for Mr Corbyn to meet during his visit to Stormont, as his party refuses to allow local members to stand for election under its banner.Asked whether he had any regrets about banning Labour members in Northern Ireland from contesting elections, Mr Corbyn said: “As you know, our party is talking to Labour members in Northern Ireland, and our National Executive will be considering the issue again.”Mr Corbyn said he had also met representatives of the trade unions Unison and Unite to hear about issues concerning them.The North London MP also demanded more public investment in Northern Ireland, branding health inequalities here “appalling and disgraceful”.Asked about ‘Brexit Day’ today, Mr Corbyn said: “Well, it’s going to be a day when many people will no doubt be concerned, because it’s unclear in the longer term what the process will be for sending goods from Northern Ireland to Britain. “We will take back to Westminster a clear message from this visit: the assembly is up and running, the Executive is up and running — and as the party which brought about the Good Friday Agreement, Labour is particularly pleased and proud of that.“But that has to be followed up with the necessary resources to ensure resolution of the public sector pay issues, and it also has to bring clarity to the future trading relationship which will protect jobs and businesses across Northern Ireland.”The Labour leader was accompanied by Tony Lloyd, the party’s Northern Ireland spokesman .Mr Corbyn also signed the book of condolence for the late Seamus Mallon, the former SDLP Deputy First Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"girl saved by air ambulance after being knocked down by own mother","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From chatting to a few of their supporters, the U experiment didnt work in Cavan. Their answers were all a resounding no. Simple as that. From their informal discussions with other clubs, the ing consensus was the same. Players who stepped out of U football werent ready for senior. Many never kicked a ball all season. One of the clubs made representation to reverse it, but the Cavan county board told them that GAA management at Croke Park wouldnt be making the U-turn. An U competition  Indeed. Any how exactly is that going to work, how substantial is it going to be and where does it fit in  googletag.cmd.push Reserve football has been on its knees for some time. The current U club championships, while they are terric to win, dont exactly hold the same clout as they should. For the last two seasons, the holders Lavey and Magherafelt found their title defence clashing with a county senior final. The clubs made the decision to withdraw. Its not a slight on the families of Jack Cassidy or Harry OKane, who the competitions are named after, or the CCC that run them. Thats just where these competitions fit. So how are Us going to be accommodated  More recently the implications of moving the new U grade on top of the McLarnon and MacRory Cups knock-out phases has just brought to a head what was always going to happen. There has always been a grey area between schools and county minors. I have had experience of it myself and generally, with good will, it works itself out. In an interview with the County Derry Post last week, current Derry minor manager Martin Boyle highlighted the dficult balancing act he faces but was content that the players were getting good coaching and playing regularly. From speaking, informally, to Peter Keane after a Kerry minor game a few years back, he pointed to the input of St Brendans Killarney and Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne to the Kerry project. Keane is right. In my view, its all about give and take but the shuffle from U to U is just ludicrous. There is no other word for it. I rocked up to Celtic Park earlier this month to cover Derry Us first game with Donegal. Have you any boots with ye, Mal, came the response from Mickey Donnelly at my request for a starting team. He was laughing but on the inside he was anything but. The ruling from Croke Park in December was kicking into gear. No players representing their school, at senior A and B level, were eligible to play county football until their school season came to an end. Donnelly hit out at the ruling and its implications in his post game interview. On the day, Derry had three substitutes that could be used and didnt have access to senior lists Alex Doherty and Ben McCarron. Heaped on this, Derry had  players on schools  and Donnelly - a MacRory and Hogan Cup winning manager himself - confirmed the county made representation to have the ruling looked into. Following an initial approach by Fermanagh to GAAs Ard Chomhairle, it was decided thata county felt the ruling prevented them from fielding a team, they could apply for an exception to the rule. In a communication to all MacRory and McLarnon schools, seen by the County Derry Post, Ulster Schools secretary Seamus Woods stated that  counties had availed of it and it was open to others. The situation was discussed at  at their meeting last Monday night and Woods hit out at the ruling being relaxed in his statement. He felt that in the absence of a couple of players, counties could give others a chance to wear the county jersey. Seamus point is valid, on paper. But in Derry there are more players involved. The relaxation of ruling has forced the schools committee to change their quarter-final dates and insist that all games, with the exception of the two finals are to use the finish on the day protocol. In my view, the u-turn just gets the decision makers out of a short term problem. It takes the heat off them but it is the players who will suffer. Players deserve the opportunity to properly prepare for both school and county teams. Their managers deserve it. At the end of the day, it is an honour to wear your county jersey in championship or bolt out of the Athletic Grounds tunnel on MacRory final day. As is stands, players, who are in one of their most important years of their lives in terms of education are going to be caught in the middle. MacRory versus U. And they will want both. Derrys six at St Patricks Maghera, includes injured duo Jamie Duggan and Ronan McFaul, Aidan McCluskeyand St Pius Iarlaith Donaghy will be in U action on Saturday, February . This is the same weekend as the MacRory McLarnon games. Loreto and St Columbs Derry are tipped to win their play-offs this week, which could add Odhraacuten McLarnon and Naoise Oacute Mianaacutein to the list. That could be  players double booked on the first week of February. Its not fair on all parties and in my view, it has all been caused by moving the goalposts to U and U. Whoever is responsible for ensuring it stays like this needs to take their head out of the sand and move it back to the way it was. They could do worse than get the likes of Peter Keane, Eamon Fitzmaurice and Mickey Donnelly around a table and discuss the obstacles they came across. They are well versed in balancing all the spinning plates at this age group. And back it up by surveying Iarlaith Donaghy, Enda Downey and their counterparts across the  counties for their take on U versus school. This would be  opinions from the group that really matter in this - the players. Surely this is the way forward and needs to be proposed, right now. Otherwise, all the years of development squads and school competitions, will be in vain. A waste of money and time. WATCH Mickey Donnelly hits out at fixture clash.

Here is how the Derry players performed. O Lynch – Kicked well for much of the game on his league debut. Was punished for a short kick-out that led to a score and his unconvincing punch resulted in Leitrims goal L McGoldrick – Battled well but couldnt keep a lid on Keith Beirne but his runs forward helped drive Derry back into the game before half-time. B Rogers – Conceded possession to Shane Moran in the first-half. Faired better in the second-half with some unselfish runs forward. Caught in possession in Derrys last attack. googletag.cmd.push P McGrogan – Started off on Beirne where he struggled before moving onto Moran at the break. His interception prevented a second Leitrim goal and he got forward as the game went on. C McKaigue – Caught out of position when Leitrim hit Derry on the break early on. Led by example the first-half moved on. Won a vital - ball leading to a score and kicked his side into an interval lead. C McCluskey – Conceded a free to Darragh Rooney after McGuigans goal but overall had a sound game. Got forward when he could in the first-half and defended with courage in the second. googletag.cmd.push C Doherty – Was involved in a lot of Derrys breaks from defence including McFauls opener. On the flip side, his sloppy pass in the first-half was punished at the end of a Leitrim breakaway. G ONeill – His first outing of the season. Did a lot of spadework in Derrys battle back from five points down and was involved in Emmett Bradleys goal. C McFaul – Won the duel with Oisin McCaffrey. His appetite for possession kept Derry in the game. He kicked both the opening point and the equaliser. E Bradley – His finish for the goal was a cracker and he showed well as a kick-out option. He was central to Derrys rally in the first-half but guilty of two missed chances hed usually take. D Tallon – The Glen man played in a ball carrier role, between midfield and Ryan Bell up front. Won breaking balls and generally used the ball well. Saw a point effort carried wide by the wind in the second-half. E Duffy – Another league debutant. He played in a cluttered middle third. Wasnt involved for much of the opening quarter. Shouldve squared the ball when he went for goal and opted for a point later in the first-half. B McCarron – Started inside but didnt stay there too much. Spent much of the game bogged down in midfield but his late score was a memorable moment from his first league outing. R Bell – Didnt have the same impact as the in the McKenna Cup. Landed two points but spent a lot of time away from goal. C Bradley – Played at centre-forward but spent much of the time chasing Conor Reynolds and Jack Gilheaney back through midfield. Replaced by Shane McGuigan. SUBS S McGuigan – A hamstring concern limited him to an impact man and his goal gave Derry a second chance. N Toner – Came in for Gavin ONeill and played close to goal but not really involved much. N Keenan – Replaced Liam McGoldrick and tried to get Derry attacks going on the right wing. A Doherty – Brought for the last  minutes for a league debut. Played too far away from goal to be effective. C McWilliams – Had the chance to win the game but was blocked down by Shane Quinn and was sent off on a second booking.

Here are the players who caught the eye this week.  - Peter McKinney The Kilrea mans three saves were pivotal to his sides round two win, including his acrobatics to deny Monaghan a match-winning goal in the closing stages. He had stf competition from Derry hurling keeper Sean Kelly.  - Eoin McEvoy A second clean sheet in as many game and McEvoys sweeper role played a central part. When his side at the breeze he pushed out to win breaking ball and he kicked a point. googletag.cmd.push  - Brian Oacuteg McGilligan He was a rock at the heart of Derrys defence in their win over Down. Prevented two goals with interceptions and kept Eoghan Sands scoreless.  - Louise Dougan Listed as a forward, Louise played her normal role in the Slaughtneil defence where she was able to pull the strings and still notch two points.  - Aidan McCluskey McCluskey wore number eight but played at wing back. His work-rate was immense as St Marys worked their way back into the game. His two points were instrumental in their comeback. googletag.cmd.push  - Eamon McGill The Lavey man was tenacious at the heart of Derrys defence was his positional sense was equally important. In the first five minutes of the second-half he repelled three attacks from Downs wind-assisted threat.  - Cliodhna Hickson Her sides Ulster title bid may have come up short but Hickson had a fine hour in St Colms defence as they went down to Sacred Heart Newry. ALSO - How the Derry players rated against Leitrim.  - Eoghan Cassidy A debut to remember for John McEvoys latest recruit. Shot wide with his first attempt but had the courage to put in a fine performance. He got on the scoresheet and won vital possession as Down tried to claw their way back.  - Shannon Graham She commanded the Slaughtneil challenge. From popping up back in her own defence to getting forward to score two points, she was immense. Damien McEldowney will now have to sweat over her ankle injury ahead of the final.  -Ciaran McFaul Kicked Derrys first point of the game against Leitrim and popped up to score the equaliser late on. His demand of the ball in the middle third gave Derry a  to come back from five points down.  - Cormac ODoherty He carried on his scoring exploits from the club championship and notched  points as Derry opened their season with a win. Some of the frees were from well inside in his own half and he threw a neat dummy for late effort from play. ALSO - A player by player look at Derry hurlers win over Down  - Eunan McElhennon It took Magherafelt  minutes to register a score but his effort on the run was a neat finish. Worked tirelessly and a vital turnover stopped a Monaghan counter-attack when the game hung in the balance. -Tina Bradley A tally of - was half of her teams scoring . Her goal had a shade of fortune about it but her mobility and pace in the middle third was once again important in Slaughtneils attacking plans. - Dermot OKane The Glen began their season with a win over Sarsfields Armagh in the Ulster league. OKane hit an amazing - out of his sides - tally in a high-scoring win.  -Therese Mellon Slaughtneil were pushed to the pin of their collar at their first-half display effectively booked their All-Ireland final spot.

Richie Mullans goal was the dference between the teams but Cormac ODoherty was also on song with  points. Here is a look at how the Derry players performed. S Kelly – Conceded a free when he lunged with his feet but an otherwise unflappable performance. Safe under the dropping ball, made an important save and his long ball led to Derrys goal. P Kelly – Started on Tim Prenter before moving across to Oisin McManus. Conceded a point from play on him but his bravery was important to Derry keeping a clean sheet. googletag.cmd.push B McGilligan – Not listed to start but he was a colossus at full-back. Made a block in either half to prevent goals, the second one coming in the frantic final seconds. D Cartin – Marked a start in his new defensive role with a fine performance that included coming out with the ball twice in front of Tim Prenter in the first-half. ALSO - Match report Derry - Down - S Cassidy – Lined out at wing-back on Danny Toner and came out on top of the battle. He was strong in the air and showed mobility when Toner interchanged across the pitch. googletag.cmd.push E McGill – The fearless Lavey man had a superb game. He was always in the right place at the right time. He never game PJ Davidson an inch and dropped deeper against the wind at half-time. C Kelly – The third of three Kelly brothers in the Derry defence. Kept Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard scoreless from play. Had a solid game and his point came in the crucial final quarter. E Cassidy – As debuts go, Cassidy couldnt have hoped for better. The early wide didnt deter him. He bounced back to score later in the game and his two vital possessions late on were beyond his years. P Cleary – Was full of running at midfield. Unseen, linking the play and always an option for Derrys defence. His first-half point was a just reward. T Brady – Left almost redundant with Kellys puck-outs landing behind him. Set-up ODoherty for a score and registered one himself when Down were on the way back before a dismissal on two bookings. C ODoherty – Right from finding his range in the warm-up to his dummy for a late score from play, he never missed a shot. Edged out by Eamon McGill for man of the match. T McHugh – Like Brady, much of the play by-passed him. Almost created a second Derry goal only for a swt interception. O McKeever – Marked a fth league appearance of his career with two points. Got the better of his tussle with John McManus. A Grant – Was a frustrated figure in the first-half and never really got into the game and was replaced at the break. R Mullan – When faced with a narrow angle and Down bodies in front of him he did well to slot home his goal. Started at midfield for the second-half and played deeper. SUBS J McGuigan – Came on at the break. Put himself about and had a few chances. Failed to grab a score on his debut but played a part in Bradys point. B Glass – Came on for Odhraacuten McKeever for the last two minutes to help plug the middle as Down battled back. S McCloskey – Replaced Paul Cleary after  minutes. Gave the pass to Thomas Brady for the point that effectively sealed Derrys win. D McCloskey – Came on in stoppage time for Richie Mullan.

Thats the mantra of Ciaran Cunningham, who has ed to take charge of the Derry senior camogie team. The former Antrim hurling goalkeeper was at the helm during the  and  seasons. In the first year, Derry threw away a nine point lead against the Saffrons in the Ulster final. They shipped - inside three minutes, late in the decider in Ballybofey before going one better in the following season. “I did quite well the last time but there are a lot of girls I had with me on the  that are not there now,” Cunningham told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I think there are nine that cant commit for ious seasons. Some of them are in their final year at university but the door is still open.” After stepping away from Derry, he had been offered the Down camogie job. After accepting it, he changed his mind. It didnt sit well and for the past two years, the St Johns man ploughed all his energy into his gym business. After John ODwyers decision to step down after the final championship game last season, the position lay vacant until Cunninghamsearlier this month. “I only came in two weeks ago so it is about gathering a team together at the minute,” he stated, referring to his initial thoughts in the job. googletag.cmd.push Caroline Wilson joins him on the management and he hopes to add to it by March time. This Sunday, he leads the team into an away game with Down. “The last time I was in with Derry, we beat Down on two separate occasions and beat them quite heavily. Down have progressed and and Im not going to criticise any managers, but Derry has got stagnant,” said Cunningham. His initial focus is on the Ulster and All-Ireland championship campaigns and the new players will all get a run out during the league “I am great believer in leagues are for playing in, championships are for winning, I will be using the league to see where we are really at.” At the initial meeting, only eight players were in attendance but the numbers have risen to  for last Thursdays training session with four of five working. Training will now switch from Owenbeg to Meadowbank in Magherafelt. “A good few girls work in Belfast or are attending college so it is easier for them to get to Meadowbank,” he pointed out. “I could see from the first meeting there were eight girls available. It wouldve been easy for me to say this isnt for me but it is a challenge to me. “I am the type of character who likes a bit of a challenge. I dont really like going into a ready-made setup where someone s fingerprints have been there.” Cunningham has left the Slaughtneil players to focus on their own club season but he knows who he wants to join Derry squad when the time is right. What are Derrys chances  Cunningham points to a building process and the journey ahead. “From an Antrim man looking in, sometimes they dont realise what they actually have,” Cunningham concluded. “And I told the girls that. The nucleus is there and there is serious potential.“ ALSO - Slaughtneil advance to a fourth All-Ireland final. Click here...

I dont really like going into a ready-made setup where someone s fingerprints have been there.” Cunningham has left the Slaughtneil players to focus on their own club season but he knows who he wants to join Derry squad when the time is right. What are Derrys chances  Cunningham points to a building process and the journey ahead. “From an Antrim man looking in, sometimes they dont realise what they actually have,” Cunningham concluded. “And I told the girls that. The nucleus is there and there is serious potential.“ ALSO - Slaughtneil advance to a fourth All-Ireland final. Click here...

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

A city that shows fantastic community spirit. The night of  December was no dferent. That was the night a group of local artists decided to give something back and did so by way of a “site specic performance” of a new drama performed on the Guildhall steps to an overwhelming audience of support. Brief Synopsis: Closed Shutters is a tragic comedy full with social commentary, spoken in a Derry voice but has a global resonance. It is a story of three homeless alcoholics, set at the mouth of Christmas and takes place over  hours in their lives.The creative decision was made to perform the piece outside, as the team wanted the story to resonate with the audience. Let them feel the cold. This is what is faced by many people on our streets nightly.  Preparations began in September, with the assembly of the creative team and rehearsals. From the very beginning, everyone involved in the production made a collective decision to waive any fees. Everyone devoted their time and energy for nothing in order to give as much back to the community as possible. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Presentation of cheques to Derry Well Woman, Foyle Food Bank and North West Methodist Mession. Call outs went out on social media asking for donations of cold weather items hats, coats, scarves, gloves, blankets, sleeping bags… the list goes on. As well as the physical items, the team set up a gofundme page to raise money. They were not expecting the response they got! In the lead up to the event, as word started to spread about what was happening, the donations began… and they didn’t stop.The team reached out to the North West Methodist Mission first and were delighted when they agreed to come on board and help out, donating pound worth of brand new sleeping bags, all to be distributed to the homeless. As well as this, they provided all of the props needed and transport on the day. By way of a thank you for their kindness, North West Methodist Mission then received  bags of cold weather gear, as well as bags of food, toys and blankets. All of which went straight to those in need. A gofundme page raised pound which, in turn, was given to the North West Methodist Mission, to repay the investment they had made in the project, plus some extra. On the day of the performance, volunteers gathered around the city centre with collection buckets, while others gathered bags of cold weather items in the Guildhall. The total raised on the night was pound, which was then split between and recently presented to two local charities who do great work within the city - Derry Well Woman and Foyle Food Bank receiving pound. JP Conaghan, director, said: “To say the support was overwhelming is an understatement. The people showed up and witnessed our gt. They humbled me to a level words cannot describe. I want to say a massive GRMA agus GRAacute MOacuteR to each and every one who donated so kindly a week before Christmas.” The team have extended a heartfelt and huge thank you to everyone who supported the project in any way, whether that be by donation or by turning up on the night and sitting through the cold and wet air to watch the performance. Fiona McLaughlin, pro- ducer, said: “We cannot thank everyone enough. We never thought we could have this much of an impact. It just goes to show you what can be donewe all give a little of our time to those less fortunate. Derry City you are beautul! Although the project may have come to an end, the homeless epidemic in our city has not. Don’t let this be the end.Andrew Doherty, writer, said: “With Small charitable acts of kindness, we as a community avoid falling into the pitfalls which are destroying our community. Together we raised pound,, and hopefully through word of mouth, social media and mediums like this, the project can continue to make a dference and the pos- sibilities are endless.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He is a former member of the cathedral choir and was also a member of the choir at St Annersquos Cathedral in Belfast.He says his love of cathedrals began when he attended a service in St Maryrsquos Episcopal Cathedral in Glasgow while training to become a social worker.ldquoI just loved everything about it mdash the service, the music, the atmosphere. It all made sense, he explains.Cliversquos cathedral tour coincided with another long standing ambition mdash to play every golf course in Ireland. Travelling by camper van, hersquos played  courses to date and also written a book about it.Clive is at pains to point out that he didnrsquot just visit the cathedrals mdash he also attended a service in every one of them. Asked which was hisfavourite, he is undecided, though some stand out more than others.ldquoThe cathedrals are so dferent, so itrsquos dficult to say which was the nicest or the most impressive. I really liked some of the small ones, such as in Trim, Co Meath, Ferns in Co Waterford and Raphoe in Donegal, he says.ldquoThe bigger ones, such as in Kilkenny and Kildare, were very impressive and I really liked the visit to Rosscarbery Cathedral in Co Cork.ldquoKilmore Cathedral outside Cavan town is also lovely. Itrsquos the only building in sight and is tucked away in the trees. There was a large congregation, including around  children.At Killala Cathedral in Mayo, Clive met up with Archdeacon Stephen McWhirter, an old friend from his Scouting days.Clive says his visit to Cashel in October was memorable for another reason. ldquoI had emailed in advance explaining that I had visited all the Church of Ireland cathedrals in Ireland and asked them for the time of the service.

victory at Bear Park.In a surprisingly entertaining game, both teams had half chances in the first few minutes with Olympicrsquos Damian Travers and Dylan McCartan unable to get shots on target.Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when a Paul Kane corner kick was only cleared as far as Philly Flood, and his cross just evaded Ray Kendall who was sliding in at the back post.This was to be Floodrsquos last meaningful contribution to the game as he went over on his ankle and had to be replaced by McKibbin, with Jennings ping into left back.Tollymore started with almost the same team that was beaten last week with the exception of Paul Devlin, who was making his debut, and Mooney, Flood, and Paul Kane who were all unavailable last week.However, it was Devlin that made the dference in the first  minutes.The midfielder almost opened the scoring after  minutes when his sizzling free kick from the edge of the penalty area warmed the hands of lsquokeeper Dean Blackwood with Paul Kane heading the loose ball wide.Moments later a huge clearance from Tollymore lsquokeeper Imrie bounced over the Olympic defence, and Rory Walsh jumped with Blackwood only to see his header go wide of the target.Just as it seemed neither team was going to score, Devlin hit a wonder goal from  yards, with the power and swerve of the shot leaving Blackwood flat-footed.With the wind at their backs Tollymore stepped things up and in the th minute an astute pass from Kane picked out Rory Walsh who hit the Olympic crossbar.Devlin was replaced at half-time by Marty McCourt for his first game since early September, and while the big man looked rusty, he soon picked up the pace of the game.Both sides had half chances before Forest doubled their advantage in the th minute when a through ball from Kane saw Walsh nipping in behind the Olympic defence.The unlucky Stephen McConnell barged Walsh in the back with the striker tumbling into the advancing lsquokeeper and referee Mullan had no hesitation in awarding a sport kick.Paul Kane stepped up to take the penalty and lsquoThe Generalrsquo made no mistake to score his second goal in two games.Forest now started to take control and a terric run from James Jennings saw Maxwell and McConnell combining well to scramble the ball clear.In the st minute Walsh made the score - when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter.
