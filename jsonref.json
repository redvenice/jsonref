The artworks are part of an initiative from the artist Sam Harris, whose website the Online Art Show boasts the motto “If you can’t come to art then art will come to you” and features a selection of artists’ work to buy online.“It was an idea I had for artists to display art they had for sale,” says Harris. “The site takes you to their Instagram account or website so you can contact them to buy the artworks.”Harris’s website is an extension of his print zine Pure Filth which features 80 artists including the likes of Jake and Dinos Chapman and Noel Fielding. Gilbert \u0026amp George are not the only artists offering free window displays. The site also features art by Hayden Kays, otherwise known as the favourite artist of Harry Styles. Kays’ work comes in two parts, each featuring a different half of a rainbow – the first asks you to “stay home”, the second requests you “stay homo”.It’s not the only recent bit of public art Gilbert \u0026amp George have been involved with.

Initially, the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking.According to the travel industry’s own estimates, up to £7bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However, industry bodies such as Iata, for airlines, and Abta, for travel firms, say firms would be bankrupted by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue.Confidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday that he would not book a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely.Which?, the consumer association, said 20 of the UK’s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips, and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed.However, it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene, recognising that firms were under “unprecedented strain” and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately.While Which? said consumers’ legal right to cash refunds should be protected, it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days, and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings, and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions, to help restore confidence.Which? researchers found 10 of the UK’s biggest holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days, with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier.It also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time, with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints.Some carriers, such as Air France and KLM, have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed, issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was “a fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face”.Passengers booking with carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have told the  they have been unable to obtain refunds. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue. BA and easyJet customers have complained that call centre numbers are not being answered.A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: “Airlines are facing unprecedented challenges keeping vital routes open to repatriate stranded British travellers and transport critical medical supplies and PPE as part of cargo operations. Carriers are facing a far longer than usual volume of refund claims to get through and the current restrictions imposed nationally mean they are not able to bring in additional staff to deal with them. We are thankful to passengers for their continued patience.”Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: “We do not want to see the industry suffer further as a result of this outbreak, but it cannot be on consumers to prop up airlines and travel firms, especially when so many will be in difficult financial situations of their own.“The government must urgently set out how it will support travel firms and airlines to ensure they can meet their legal obligations to refund customers for cancelled travel plans, and avoid permanent damage to trust and confidence in the travel industry.”Some governments have already amended consumer legislation to allow deferred refunds, after calls from the airline body Iata. The Iata director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said earlier this month that refunding was “almost unbearable, financially speaking”, adding that airlines were “perfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger … but it is a matter of survival”.Abta said tour operators were being squeezed by refund requests for money that had been paid to suppliers, such as airlines and hotels, and not returned. Its chief executive, Mark Tanzer, said: “The UK government, despite repeated requests, has failed to recognise and respond to this reality, in stark contrast to the clear sensible actions taken by the European commission and many countries throughout Europe.“We fully understand and sympathise with the frustration that many customers may be feeling. But if companies are forced into bankruptcy, it will not only destroy livelihoods but extend the refund delays far beyond the term of refund credit notes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd2550cfdaea6be71f94fc7fa2bf81b7d3961005/0_382_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e921dfb2ba6d66d87ff8ac0fa10c49b","title":"corner shops describe life under lockdown as they stay open for their community","story":"Change in buying habits means many small shops are struggling to survive, while some are hit by shopliftersSome are doing home deliveries for the first time and tell of a heightened sense of caring in the community others tell of a rise in shoplifting, staff being spat at and a devastating collapse in grocery sales.As a third independent retailer dies from Covid-19, owners of corner shops across the UK tell the  about just how hard it is to cope in the pandemic.All of them are considered key workers, but they don’t have the support of retail giant owners who can offer personal protective equipment (PPE), screens, security staff or financial support when sales plummet.Yet they have one thing in common: a determination to stay open and keep serving their communities.Mohammed Faz, of Ashley’s News on Beehive Lane, has been a beacon of light for the community he serves. He is stocking yeast for the first time ever – “everyone is baking now” – though his initial offer of sanitiser and masks wasn’t successful.His store is quiet but he detected a change in custom overnight. “This community is older, people are not going up to the big shops, they can come in here, it’s safe and they know there are only one or two people in the shop at a time. So people are spending £100, £200,” he says.“They are buying everything here, toiletries, food, alcohol. They don’t want to go to the supermarkets because they don’t think they are safe.”Richard Inglis runs three shops in Southampton but has already closed one after sales plummeted from £30,000 a week to £5,000 in just five days. His staff have been abused, and he has been spat at by shoplifters. Inglis says small shops can’t afford the security personnel hired by the big supermarket chains.Over the past few weeks, a small group of drug users and street drinkers have started to hang round the front of his shop in front of the railway station daily. And they have become more sophisticated in their approach, he says.“Before, they used to come on their own, now they are coming in in teams wearing face masks, disguising their identity, and they will split up around the shop, grab whatever they can and make a dash for it. It’s worrying for my staff who have got anxieties about the virus and then these people in swearing and threatening to spit at you,” he said.“I got spat at in the face along with two of my staff by a woman the other week. She’s still on the streets. The police came and she was arrested but she was released on bail,” he explained. “The reality is if you shoplift, the biggest risk is you might be detained for 24 hours.”Omar Afzal runs the Shopsmart convenience store and post office on Saracen Street, north Glasgow and explains how people locally have adapted to the crisis.He and his staff now wear PPE, and customers take their own precautions, such as handing over their bank card in a sealed plastic bag so they can disinfect it when they get home.“It’s a very benefit-dependent area so people have not had a big shock to their income like other places. We didn’t get panic-buying here, I think that was more of a middle-class thing,” Afzal says.Like other similar shops, he adds: “We’ve seen a huge reduction in customer numbers but they tend to buy much more to keep them going.”He has now reduced the number of customers in the shop to three at a time, where they can browse three aisles selling everything from muesli to wrapping paper. People are buying more magazines and puzzle books now, as well as more vouchers for online gaming since the bookies closed.The mood of shoppers is usually good-humoured, he adds. “In an area like this it’s tough for people cooped up in flats and that can have an effect on mental health, so when people come out to the shop it’s a change of scenery, especially for children.“There’s a perception that we’re staying open for the money, but we’re key workers and we have a sense of responsibility. We are financially invested in the area but also emotionally. I’ve been here for 20 years and have seen people grow up.”Ankit Patel has recently taken over this small convenience store close to the Kingsmead Estate in London. At the outset of the lockdown he had considered closing, but felt it was important to stay open so locals could continue to top up their Oyster travel cards and use the Payzone to pay their bills.Sales have collapsed in the past few weeks, however, and he struggles to make ends meet. “We used to do 200-250 transactions a day. We’ve been open since 7am and it’s now 12.30am and we’ve had 21 transactions,” he told the  last week, checking the till.Patel blames panicked stockpiling last month. “People were panicking and they still have these things in their house, so they are only coming in here for milk and food,” he said.He is also witnessing hardship, with some customers offering to sell their phones and stolen goods. “We have people coming in to sell goods they have stolen from other shops, from supermarkets, not just groceries but things like jackets, bags,” he said.“Yesterday we had six or seven people in trying to sell their phones because they have run out of money. These are our regular customers. People are struggling, especially people who had temporary zero-hours jobs, or some people who… are also carers for elderly or sick people and they have no job, they are desperate.”Patel added that he was giving hard-up cases “a bit of credit” because he feels for them and he is part of the community.Bettyhill’s General Merchants is the only shop left open in the remote village of about 800 inhabitants on Scotland’s far north coast.Perched above the spectacular dunes of Torrisdale Bay, the road outside is eerily quiet. The shop is on the A836, on the most northerly section of the popular North Coast 500 touring route, but for now traffic is occasional and local.The owner of the convenience store and petrol station, Peter Malone, says he is still struggling to stock paracetamol after initial panic-buying. While locals still rely on the shop rather than making the 80-mile (130km) round trip to the nearest supermarket in Thurso, trade is down without the tourists. He is selling fewer sweets with no children dropping in after school, and local crofters are busy with lambing. But sales of butcher meat, bakery and milk are holding up.He has seen a significant increase in demand for home delivery. Last Friday he made 16, compared with the usual three or four before the weekend. “We knock the door and leave the shopping outside. Older people might want some help carrying it, so we take it into their kitchen and clean behind us on the way out.”Malone is used to the shop acting as a community hub, but this is made all the more apparent now in a village with a significant proportion of older residents. “It was always the case that we were the centre point, and people will tell us things that we then pass on. The mood in Bettyhill is fairly positive, most people are quite happy that we need to be in lockdown to protect the older population.”Lola Otuagomah is gazing out of the large window in a blue mask watching the near-empty buses go by. His is a destination shop for African food lovers and most, he says, are now too afraid to take the bus to get to him.He points to the shelves of plastic containers of freshly cooked food including Waakye, fresh moin-moin, jollof rice and pepper soup. “Usually these are already gone by now. I have only sold one today.”He is also afraid he will run out of stock as the lockdowns have meant supplies are not coming in of specialist milled grains, beans and nuts. “If the borders don’t open again it will be very, very difficult,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1743c222600743e42900fdb3301e7ba6d266ebb6/0_300_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22c00079fc365229a76fa9664a9a97ff","title":"uk firms plan legal action against hiscox over covid 19 insurance claims","story":"More than 100 pubs and nightclubs join forces over non-payment of pandemic claimsMore than 100 nightclubs, pubs and bars are planning coordinated legal action against the insurer Hiscox over its non-payment of business interruption insurance claims.Hiscox sold policies before coronavirus hit the headlines, stating it would pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease.Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic.Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which is coordinating the action, said: “Businesses are being denied legitimate insurance claims, many claims are being disputed by insurers based on contrived arguments to avoid sharing the financial burden during the Covid-19 crisis.”The group, which is being advised by the licensing industry barrister Philip Kolvin QC, is calling on more businesses to join its move against the insurer.The NTIA action comes as two separate Hiscox action groups, together involving about 200 more claimants, also consider legal action. The chef Raymond Blanc has also reportedly signed up lawyers after being denied a payout by Hiscox.One action group backed by the insurance brokers advisory firm CEC, representing more than 30 businesses including gyms, restaurants and golf professionals, said at least some of Hiscox’s policies clearly state it would pay up where the interruption to the business was “due to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease”.Roger Topping, of the action group, said some of the policies stated payouts would reflect how the business would have traded if the restrictions had not been imposed.Business interruption policies typically pay up to £100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.Simon Ager, who runs the Pinnacle climbing centre in Northampton, started an action group that now has more than 100 members after being told his policy with Hiscox, including cover for losses up to £100,000, would not pay out on coronavirus pandemic claims.On Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures.It said its core small commercial package policies did not provide cover for business interruption as a result of the “general measures” taken by the government in response to the pandemic.It said in a statement: “A number of UK policyholders have disputed the application of their policy in relation to business interruption. Hiscox recognises these are extremely difficult times for businesses and is determined to help provide greater certainty for customers. As a priority it will therefore work with the UK insurance industry, its regulators and its customers to seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available.”Hiscox added it was “actively settling claims” for event cancellation and abandonment, media and entertainment and other industries including travel. It expects to pay out $150m (£120m) to settle claims if restrictions on travel and mass gatherings continue for six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/197623d3af2e03d5f268aab3ec6a6be25f29b399/0_432_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5416bdf56b46f4e8e5ae83b419c05c41","title":"are you a shambolic first time runner i was too until a coach gave me some tips","story":"Slow as I was, it wasn’t until I caught my reflection in a shop window that I realised something was wrong. Then I was told what to do with my arms and legsJoggers are coming in for some stick, what with all their droplets and rule-infringing pavement hogging. I feel no anger towards them, only concern and pity – because there are some gaits from hell out there. Arms flail around, above legs uncoordinated with them often the legs barely coordinate with each other. They are making it so hard for themselves and will surely get injured. It’s not their fault it’s unlikely they’ve ever been taught how to run properly.I got into running when I was about 30. I weighed 18 stone, about three stone of which I plainly needed to lose. At the time, there wasn’t a lot of this HIIT fast interval training caper around it was all about putting in lots of slow, steady miles. As we all keep saying, it is very important to follow the science, so that is what I did: hours and hours plodding streets, parks, river paths, hills, fields and mountains. After each run, again following the science (well, my interpretation of it anyway), I troughed carbohydrate-heavy fare in great quantities. My longest training run lasted six hours. My biggest post-run feed involved an entire wholemeal loaf and bunch of bananas.My first marathon was in New York. I romped home in several seconds less than five hours. For a week I couldn’t get up or down stairs, or on or off a toilet, without assistance. In all I ran three more marathons, running many hundreds of miles in training, without losing an ounce. In my last race, I beat four hours by all of 17 seconds if there was an 18 stone-plus category, I may have been well-placed. I only eventually lost weight by running less, and eating a lot less, but that’s another story.Slow and heavy as I was, I still rather fancied myself as a runner. But then, jogging past some shops early on a spring morning, I saw my reflection. And what a shambles I was, lolloping on, shoulders hunched and head bowed. My posture is terrible at the best of times. On a good day, I resemble the chap in second place on that drawing of the five evolutionary stages of man. On a bad day, I’m the one behind him. While running, I was the one behind that.I went to see a running coach, Mike Antoniades, who filmed me on a treadmill. The most bizarre thing was my arms. The left one pumped backwards and forwards, while the right arm pumped to and fro across my body.“Do you carry a shoulder bag much?” he asked.“That’ll be it.”I called Mike this week and, predictably, he is in despair at what he is seeing out there. There is a lot more to it than this, but I will pass on a couple of tips. First, the arms, which Mike says are important: “Think of them as pistons.” They should be bent at around 90 degrees and should pump back and forth in as straight a line as possible, and never across the middle of the body. Concentrate on thrusting the elbows backwards a good way, and the arms’ forward movement will look after itself. It is similar for the legs: keep them moving in a straight line and make sure that each time a leg goes back, the lower half (the calf bit) of it finishes at least parallel with the ground.Sadly, my joints are now so knackered from the mega-hours of plodding I put in 20 years ago that I can’t run much these days. I am still embarrassingly slow, as the grandparent who overtook me pushing a pram yesterday will confirm, but by God, I’m good to look at. Poetry in slow motion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8cc1c56b823aa0b323cf219744ab1c01e67452/0_60_3300_1982/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d83c311e159d7156eb79167bb35b863","title":"briton no 10 leadership power vacuum coronavirus","story":"With a power vacuum in Westminster, devolved leaders such as Nicola Sturgeon are already voicing dissent on vital coronavirus issuesShould we all be wearing masks to go out in public? Sadiq Khan, London’s Mayor, publicly broke ranks last week to argue for compulsory face-covering on public transport and as I write, the government’s scientific advisers are re-reviewing the pros and cons after Germany and the US started recommending masks for ordinary members of the public.Fears remain that a run on masks could either leave NHS workers dangerously short of them or make wearers overconfident, if they don’t realise that mask-wearing is about trying to protect other people rather than yourself. But look around your nearest supermarket to see how many people are no longer waiting for ministers to make their minds up at the weekend, I spotted everything from strategically positioned scarves to cycling kit, builders’ dust masks and home-stitched floral numbers. Whatever the experts conclude, Khan seems to be going with the grain of public instinct, and if the advice does ultimately change then he’ll have left government looking slow-footed even if it has hesitated for the best of reasons. (Ministers are taking their lead from the World Health Organization, which still isn’t recommending masks for general public use.)But this isn’t just about masks. The inevitable leadership vacuum created by Boris Johnson’s illness is starting to be filled less by ambitious lieutenants – although the news of an anonymous Downing Street source briefing against Matt Hancock’s promise of 100,000 tests a day suggests things are getting alarmingly fractious – than by emboldened devolved leaders. Nicola Sturgeon has already warned Scotland won’t necessarily follow whatever path Johnson eventually sets out of lockdown, promising to treat Scots like “the grownups you are” by laying out her own personal thinking this week. (The echo of Angela Merkel, praised for providing detailed explanations of the science underpinning her decisions rather than fobbing off tough questions with invocations of Dunkirk spirit, is surely deliberate.) Even Wales’s first minister Mark Drakeford, while worrying that it would be harder to enforce lockdown rules that varied across the country, has said he would “do things differently” in Wales if necessary. If Downing Street tries to lift the lockdown too quickly, it could trigger a constitutional showdown like that unfolding in the US, where inidual state governors have chosen to protect their citizens by defying Donald Trump’s attempts to reopen the economy. And while it’s one thing brushing off questions about why Britain isn’t doing what South Korea is doing, it’s quite another explaining why Scotland appears to have no confidence in your strategy.A cynic might say all this is dangerous game-playing by Labour and SNP politicians facing elections next spring, who won’t want to be seen as having blindly followed in Westminster’s footsteps if by then the public mood has turned. (For now, polling shows voters are still more supportive of this government’s handling of the epidemic than the left likes to think, although with doubts creeping in about NHS workers being properly protected from the virus the failure of a much-vaunted big shipment of protective equipment from Turkey to materialise forms part of a bigger worrying pattern of overpromising and underdelivering.) It does the Scottish nationalist cause in particular no harm for Sturgeon to emerge looking like a plausible alternative to Westminster leadership in a crisis.But you can’t devolve education and health policy and then expect devolved governments not to use their powers in a once-in-a-generation emergency, and nor can practical differences to everyday lives be ignored. Talking about schools possibly starting to come back in July, fitting in a few weeks’ teaching before the holidays, makes sense in England but not in Scotland where schools break up at the end of June. Masks could well give city-dwellers confidence about getting back on the Tube, but would the balance of risks and benefits be the same in sparsely populated rural areas where most people drive to work?Half the point of devolution was to acknowledge that what works for one part of the union doesn’t always work everywhere, and to manage the resulting tensions.

Unfortunately, that is no longer possibleAcross America, more and more doctors are proudly working longer shifts, under challenging conditions, in an effort to protect our communities from Covid-19. But we’re also performing a second, unpaid gig not commonly associated with being a physician: entering the arena of media and politics after our shifts end, to publicly advocate for the needs of our patients and fellow health workers.After long shifts at our hospitals, doctors are now going on social media and speaking to politicians and others with the ability to implement safe policies and practices. In issuing exhortations to the government – institute a national lockdown, expedite production of tests, send ventilators and protective equipment immediately – what drives us is concern for our patients and ourselves. While many of us have political views we’ll express outside of work, we’re used to keeping that part of ourselves walled off when we don our scrubs and lab coats. But because of our growing frustration at the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic that now puts every American at risk, thousands of physicians have become activist doctors.Stated differently, it’s one thing to have political views on the side (heck, I even ran for office once). But we’re now at a place where doctors need to engage in public advocacy as an urgent part of our job.Without proper protective equipment, doctors are practically defenseless against Covid-19. (My team and I are actually lucky, relative to our brothers and sisters in hotspot emergency rooms, who have become cannon fodder in trash bags.) Make no mistake, we doctors signed up for this job. We took an oath to protect our communities and do no harm. And increasingly, more of us now believe that this oath requires us to speak out about the catastrophic mismanagement and misinformation from the federal government. What we want above all is for the administration to listen to doctors, nurses and frontline health workers – and stop playing politics.Believe me, many doctors would prefer to avoid the topic of politics. But when the president refuses to ramp up production of ventilators that can save the lives of patients in respiratory failure, speaking up avoids harm to our patients. When the administration fails to provide protective equipment to frontline health workers, we feel a duty to fight for physicians risking their lives. Hence #WeNeedPPE has started trending among physicians.In my home state of Michigan, our governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has been working hard to combat the impact of this deadly virus. When Trump criticizes her and threatens to withhold aid from our state, it forces many doctors who usually eschew politics in the workplace to speak out. Why? As first-person witnesses to the tragedy of this pandemic, we know our colleagues, friends and neighbors could pay with their lives.I work the overnight shift in the emergency department of my rural Michigan hospital. Patients are coming into our small emergency department with symptoms consistent with Covid-19. But based on an inadequate response by our federal government, we have a shortage of tests for the virus. The result: we only test patients we deem critical enough to admit to the hospital, frontline healthcare workers and public safety officials, and people with weakened immune systems. Others are sent home without testing. We assume they have Covid-19. All we can do is tell them to isolate themselves for the appropriate amount of time, and we move to the next room or the next patient in the tent.If we remain silent about this problem, we are shirking our duty. The result is we’ve had to become public advocates. We have no choice.I work with an amazing team of nurses, nurse assistants, X-ray and lab techs, and cleaners. During every shift, we go in and out of exam rooms, circulating among patients who may be Covid-19 positive. A few of those patients, struggling to breathe, exhale loudly or cough into our faces. At the back of our minds, we think back to our children, our families at home, wondering if we’d told them enough how much we love them more than anything in the world.At the end of my shift, I place my N95 mask in a paper bag. For the next five shifts, unless it’s torn or soiled, that blue mask is all that stands between me and one of the most contagious, deadliest viruses we’ve seen in generations.Before I drive home, as the sun rises, I post a brief selfie to share my thoughts about Covid-19 on social media. When I get home, I thoroughly clean myself and start connecting with other doctors across America. More and more of us pledge to speak out about what we need to save lives – our patients’ and our own. Every few days, I get calls from the news media about what doctors and our patients need. More masks, gowns, gloves, ICU beds, ventilators. Through a camera hooked up to my laptop that beams me to studios at national cable news outlets and other platforms, I implore the president to take action to ensure doctors and frontline medical staff get resources to protect themselves, care for people and save lives.Then I sleep for a few hours and do it all over again.What specifically do we physicians advocate for? Thousands of us have signed a letter urging the administration to do three things that could give doctors, hospitals and Americans a fighting chance against Covid-19.First, we need mass testing that could help us better track the spread of the disease, something South Korea and Germany did early on and who appear to be keeping Covid-19 from metastasizing into an uncontrollable tumor.Next, a national shelter-in-place order can buy hospitals some time as Covid-19 rampages across America, spread by a mix of asymptomatic carriers and reckless spring breakers.And third, we need to fully implement and enforce the Defense Production Act to mobilize the national manufacture of critical lifesaving equipment, from N95 masks to ventilators.Time is short. Unless we act soon, many of us will get sick. Some of us have already lost our lives. And more Americans will be at risk when frontline health workers drop like flies. With enough equipment and the right policies, we can rein in this pandemic and save lives.For many of us doctors, that means advocating for our patients and colleagues not just privately, but publicly. It’s a new role for most doctors, but the times – and our oath – demand it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2270d2facb8f151192b993bc5987e6696a9fa37/0_202_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5848fa9b2503cd5780c3f29d2a57a59b","title":"flattening curve new zealand coronavirus","story":"Countries that are actively working to contain coronavirus are buying themselves time to deal with its uncertain outcomes As Sars-CoV-2 has spread across the world, some countries have reacted with alarm and thorough preparations, given their previous experiences with Mers or Sars. In these countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, containment of the novel coronavirus became the imperative, regardless of cost. However, other countries chose to treat it like a bad flu strain that would be unstoppable and spread across the population until some kind of immunity was reached.Much of the difference in countries’ initial responses can be attributed to whether they “overreacted”, given prior experience with two other more deadly coronaviruses, or whether they perceived the novel coronavirus from the start as just posing a moderate to low risk to their populations and eventually becoming endemic.In the UK, the assumption until quite recently had seemed to be the latter. The containment phase ended on 12 March. At this point, testing ended for all those with minor symptoms (including frontline health staff), contact tracing stopped, airports remained open without checks on incoming flights or passengers, and physical distancing measures were ruled out. Large events involving tens of thousands of people went ahead a few days later, and non-essential travel continued. After considerable public pressure, lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March with the goal of keeping the coronavirus-related burden on health services within NHS capacity.Where are we now? According to official figures, 16,509 people with Covid-19 have so far died in British hospitals. There are no official statistics for deaths in the community, but ONS data released today shows that of 6,200 Covid-19-related deaths in the week to 10 April, one in six of them happened outside hospital. We are on track for 40,000 deaths by just the end of the first wave of this outbreak, while also having to cope with the astronomical economic costs and heart-rending social implications of being in lockdown for weeks on end.In a significant number of confirmed Covid cases, the health outcomes are severe, the disease can result in multiple organ failure and long-term lung damage, and the clinical need of patients for oxygen, ICU care and ventilators is much higher. Early clinical management of symptoms, to which Boris Johnson had access, means that outcomes are generally better, but that requires testing at an early stage of the disease.New Zealand is in the enviable position of having fewer than 20 deaths, while Australia has managed to stay under 100. With early physical distancing measures and border control, and aggressive testing, tracing and isolating procedures in place, these countries are in a better position to ease lockdown earlier and get their economy and society going again, while keeping Covid-19-related deaths low. That’s as close to a win-win situation as a government can have right now.However, when these international comparisons are made, some in government say that it is still too early to say how countries are performing, and others say that all countries will be in the same place, and any variation will depend on their healthcare capacity. It is worth thinking through the long-term scenarios for the future of Covid-19.The first scenario: if we have an effective, safe and available vaccine or antiviral in the next 18 months, the countries that minimised loss of life with the least harsh economic restrictions will be in the best position. Australia, New Zealand and numerous east Asian countries have the outbreak under control and can in the short term manage the trickle of cases while waiting for the scientific solution.The second scenario: in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral, some kind of population immunity will be built up so that the virus is not actively transmitting at a high level. This assumes that having the coronavirus leads to immunity for at least two or three years and that subsequent reinfection is mild. Even in this situation, the countries with low numbers of cases can wait for ongoing research on better identification of who is exactly “vulnerable” to developing severe symptoms, and shield these iniduals so the burden on ICU care and loss of life are kept to a minimum. While we have some basic idea at population level about who is vulnerable, based on age and pre-existing conditions, scientists do not understand the inidual genetic or immunological factors yet.The third (worst-case) scenario: research might find that there is no lasting immunity to the virus, or in fact immune enhancement, which means subsequent reinfections would be more severe (similar to dengue). This creates a real case for countries with the capacity to eliminate the virus and keep in place border controls . Obviously the fewer cases present, the easier it is to eliminate a virus, and in this situation a precautionary approach to letting it spread through the population would have been well warranted.In short, there are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, about the possibility and timeline for a vaccine or antiviral therapy, about who exactly is vulnerable, and about long-term health implications. For example, Italian scientists have warned that some patients are developing Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary paralysis) as a side effect of Covid-19.In this uncertainty, countries that are actively working to contain this virus and keep numbers as low as possible are buying time to build a more informed policy response while also protecting their economies and societies. Others, by letting the virus spread slowly through their populations (only flattening the curve instead of completely stopping the spread), are just gambling with people’s lives, and will be caught in cycles of lockdownrelease that will destroy the economy and cause social unrest, as well as increased Covid-19- and non-Covid-19-related deaths.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637c8d857189d0b26f8229f506ea4049f4cb2bbb/0_420_4237_2542/master/4237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94a4821394c2b105059121a85b95a49","title":"the good place star jameela jamil on controversy and coming out","story":"The star of The Good Place is adored and vilified for speaking out. She talks about attention-seeking, body hair, Twitter feuds with Piers Morgan – and why no one should ever shake hands againWere she another kind of person, Jameela Jamil would have an easy life. Everything seemed to be going her way. First came the break that led to a job presenting Channel 4’s Saturday morning hangover slot, T4, which was followed by a job on Radio 1, before a swift, and unexpected, move to become an actor on the hit US sitcom The Good Place. Yet barely a month goes by without Jamil popping up to ignite some controversy or inflame the kind of commentator incensed by any hint of perceived “wokeness”.February was a particularly difficult month. First, she came out as queer, which appeared to infuriate many people. Then she had to defend herself against accusations she had Munchausen’s syndrome – a psychiatric disorder in which people feign illness – an allegation started by a writer who didn’t believe her history of health problems. She ended the month embroiled in a Twitter row with Piers Morgan (public feuds being something of a natural stomping ground for both) after the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack.Does Jamil ever feel like living a quieter life? “It’s not an easy path,” she says. “You get hurled up on to a pedestal and it always feels a bit like a trap – it’s very high, it’s easy to slip off and it’s a long way down. I’m just learning, I’m not the authority on anything.” She has not, she says, “handled myself perfectly at all times, but I am a human, prone to error”.We talk on the phone, with Jamil calling from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her boyfriend, the musician James Blake and three friends. The lockdown has not been too difficult, she says. “I couldn’t feel more privileged right now. I’m safe, I have a house. I can afford to not work for a while and I have my health,” she says.“On a more frivolous note, I’m really happy that handshaking is kind of cancelled for ever.” It has always appalled her, she says, and her explanation is something I have never considered before and will never be able to forget. “The fact you know that a hand has been on a dick at some point before touching your hand is deeply unsettling,” she says with a laugh, going on to describe it as “a sort of penile imprint upon your palm”. She has always succumbed to polite convention when someone puts their hand out. “Never again.”She is excited, too, about the possible return of women’s body hair, saying that “we’re coming out of this furrier, chubbier, spottier and hopefully alive. And that’s great – we are the lucky ones.” Might it mark the end of the ridiculous grooming ideals (the lip fillers, the weirdly immaculate eyebrows)? “For women who have transitioned, I think not having access to aestheticians is really difficult. But I think some women are becoming used to seeing their faces without makeup, and realising that you don’t need all of the nonsense that we have flogged at us.”She has a new podcast, which started at the beginning of the month, and she will soon launch a YouTube show. (“Is there anything sadder than a 34-year-old trying to start a YouTube channel?” she laughs.) Both come under her I Weigh movement, a campaign that started on Instagram in 2018 to promote the idea that people, especially women, should be “weighed” by their achievements rather than the number on their bathroom scales – and to promote inclusivity, social justice and mental health. If her guests seem to open up, it is probably because Jamil herself is incredibly candid. In the episode with Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general of the US and author of Together, a book about loneliness, Jamil talks about trying to kill herself at 26. In other episodes, she talks about the eating disorder she had as a teenager. It is almost easy to see why the conspiracy theory that she has Munchausen’s syndrome took off she has been through so much, almost too much for one person.She attended an independent girls’ school in London (on a scholarship she and her brother were mostly brought up by their mother, a school secretary) where she says she was the victim of racist bullying that was physical and violent. She was abused as a child, and was later the victim of several sexual assaults. She has said she has been raped several times. At 17, she was hit by a car, severely damaging her spine, and spent more than a year recovering. Mental illness led to the attempt to kill herself in her mid-20s, at which point she sought therapy. She also went through several painful operations as a child to deal with hearing loss, and has coeliac disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects the body’s connective tissues.She had not come out before “because I was worried that people would think I was jumping on a trendy bandwagon. And various other reasons. So I understand the pushback.” What she didn’t understand, she says, were the claims she was a liar. “What a weird lie,” she says with a laugh. “It doesn’t help to identify yourself in any way in an industry that still discriminates against people. But the rest of it, I understood. That’s why I didn’t come back complaining.”The same criticisms around appropriation have surrounded Jamil’s campaigning on body image when she herself is slim and conventionally beautiful. She has been accused of shaming other women – most damagingly black women, such as the rapper CupcakKe (after the entertainer announced she had been on a 40-day “water fast”) without acknowledging that the policing of black women’s bodies comes with its own painful history. There have also been accusations she has adopted the words and ideas of others, such as the writer Stephanie Yeboah. Her brand of feminism has been described as “exclusionary … and toxic” by the writer Danielle Dash.Jamil has always said she is constantly learning, and readily admits to her own mistakes and gaps in her knowledge. (In October, for instance, she explained she knew little about George W Bush’s presidency after being embroiled in another Twitter row.) Using her platform, particularly as one of the most high-profile women of south Asian heritage in the western media, puts her in a tricky position. Does she speak out about airbrushing and start feuds with the Kardashians over the diet products they promote – and risk making mistakes – or keep quiet? “I’ve asked repeatedly for magazines to put me on the cover with women of different body shapes, and with disabilities, and they say no. So either no one has the conversation or I do the photoshoot by myself because then at least the conversation gets had.” People have been impatient, she says her YouTube show will provide a platform for other activists. “You have to take hold of the mic first before you can pass it,” she says.Jamil is so isive, seemingly equally championed by those who like her openness and sense of humour (she is not an earnest sort of activist), and vilified by those who think she is endlessly virtue-signalling for her own gain. Blake sometimes steps in. (After the Munchausen’s rumour went viral, he posted: “It’s pretty disgusting to watch the woman I love just be dog piled on every day.”) Would she rather he didn’t? She laughs. “I don’t want it to impair his career in any way just because I’m in a controversy. But it must be difficult to see people hurt someone you love. I’m very lucky to have someone this diehard in my corner.”They had not really spoken “just because of what had been going on”, says Jamil (in October, Jamil had criticised a cosmetic surgery show Flack would be presenting). “She reached out to me with a message of such love, and she passed away that week.” The next week, Piers Morgan posted text messages from Flack on Twitter, sent to him last year saying she was “struggling” with Jamil, “as if I was any contribution to her passing, when I’d never instigated any kind of argument with Caroline. I don’t criticise the host, I criticise the show.” She says she didn’t publish Flack’s last message to her “because I’m not a scumbag”.Ultimately, she says, she will not shut up. Outspoken women, and especially outspoken women of colour, are disproportionately attacked online. “That isn’t just about the woman they are vilifying,” says Jamil. “It’s also a deliberate message they are sending out to all other women to not speak out, to not stand for something, to not break the rules. And that’s why I can’t back down now, because otherwise it would say that it wasn’t worth it and that I shouldn’t have stuck my neck out.”But it was her breakdown in her mid-20s that became the bigger pivotal moment. “After that, I realised it was very much do or die, and I had to investigate everything that had led me to such a low point,” she says. “One of those things was shame. You place the blame upon yourself, especially when you’re very young. But also just shame for being a woman. You’re too skinny, you’re too fat, you’re not smart enough or you’re too smart. I completely accept my own fuck-ups, but a lot of things that have caused a lot of trauma are not my fault.”That’s why she does what she does, she says – the social-media posts that sometimes strike the wrong note, the fights, the campaigns. “Important conversations feel uncomfortable. And therefore we leave young people unarmed.” She would like to work on syllabuses for schools “so that we don’t learn more about igneous rock than we learn about consent, eating disorders and the lies of social media”.What next for Jamil? She has built up a large social-media following and something of a power base. If it is to further her acting career, constantly criticising many aspects of the entertainment industry would be a funny way of going about it. So no nice, easy life for her. “I would do certain things differently,” she says. “I would rather start the fights that I start and sometimes get into the trouble that I get into than sit here silently and be complicit in an industry that pumps so much toxicity into the world.” She understands some people’s wariness of her, she says. “I look like the enemy. I’m a slim, privileged person who exists within this industry I totally get the mistrust. I will just have to do the work to prove I wasn’t such a shitbag after all. I’m not doing this for popularity. I’m doing this so that I can undo the stuff that I saw when I was younger, that made me unwell, and try to change it.”There is a smile in her voice as she says: “And sometimes you have to be annoying and attention-seeking in order to instigate that change.”• Jameela Jamil’s I Weigh podcast is hosted at www.earwolf"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/319f3e1f1aa73aea3f05f80bb8ae2f687c4d2de6/0_289_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07f474b6b59c27a455cc1f6b3689d246","title":"climate strikes continue online we want to keep the momentum going","story":"Activists hold mass video calls and share hashtags, and three-day livestream planned for Earth DayThe large crowds and brightly coloured placards of the school climate strikes became some of the defining images of 2019.“There would be lots of chanting and the energy was always amazing,” says Dominique Palmer, a 20-year-old climate activist from London who has been involved with the strikes for more than a year. “Being there with everyone in that moment is truly an electrifying feeling. It’s very different now.”The coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to large gatherings of people the world over, and the climate strikers have had to change their tactics. Now, instead of big crowds they hold mass video calls, and instead of marching with banners and placards they post photos with hashtags.“We’ve started digital striking because we want to keep the momentum going, so that when the pandemic is contained we still have that energy and we can go back on to the streets,” says Palmer.Every Friday, the strikers post photos of themselves holding a sign with a message about the climate crisis along with #DigitalStrike or #ClimateStrikeOnline, and they congregate in large Zoom calls, often with more than 100 people.“It’s the greatest call but also the most chaotic call you could ever imagine,” says Rikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark. “Sometimes people bring animals one time someone was playing the saxophone.”The calls are giving the strikers a unique opportunity to connect with people they would not normally get the chance to meet. “I think we will start to see more of an international perspective in every country because of this,” says Nielsen.The digital strikes are not the only online climate activism. In the US, groups are preparing a three-day livestream to mark Earth Day, an annual event celebrated around the world on 22 April to demonstrate support for protecting the environment.Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.But the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.Among the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.On Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.Fridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, Talks for Future, which features climate scientists and other experts.Activists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects.This new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. “My activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn’t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,” she says.“Striking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.”Dylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. “I think it’s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it’s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.”While the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning.“We are more present on the streets, and we know it’s not a social media bubble – we’re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,” Nielsen says.As the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority.“It’s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,” says Hamilton. “We know that you can’t do everything all at once.”There is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle – not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed.“We’ve lost a bit of motivation,” Hamilton adds. “We don’t know when we’re going to be able to do the big protests again.”But there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change.“Seeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,” says Palmer. “When politicians tell us things don’t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6a3b24ea2f303b6df2de37a2ea3d6d430dcd93/0_5_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5be9ac0a91153e3d7386d413ec4fd95","title":"fossil fuel industry stop the money pipeline","story":"Taking down the fossil fuel industry requires taking on the institutions that finance it. Even during a pandemic, this movement is gaining steam 1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let’s think outside the pandemic bubble.)Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel described a permanently yellow horizon: “I not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.” Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: “The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller’s are black as coal.” You’ve probably heard of Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River catching fire, but here’s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller described the Hudson south of Albany: “One great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America’s cities then.But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we’re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can’t see them.The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible at today’s levels you can’t see it or smell it, and it doesn’t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That’s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don’t quite see it.And it’s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It’s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It’s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There’s no catalytic converter for CO2, which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and may even own them, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.And so we are. Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase – the planet’s largest by market capitalization – which has funneled a quarter-trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like Liberty Mutual, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL during a pandemic.This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock announced that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to edge away from coal. And Chase – well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the protest in January that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off there’s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it’s clear that these companies have no future. The estment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.Our job – a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago – is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as Donald Trump does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That’s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets last September. That’s not 20 million, but it’s on the way.We can’t be on the streets right now. So we’ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for Earth Day Live, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We’re in a race, and we’re gaining fast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c80883bdbe3e3a30a2bbc3f5bba26ace40e38b2/0_142_2069_1241/master/2069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e7549a92514d76e730844bad384c31","title":"new big 5 wildlife photography project in pictures","story":"An international initiative aims to do away with the old big five of wildlife – based on the toughest animals to shoot and kill – and create a new selection based on photography, not hunting.

To mark Earth Day, we asked sustainable fashion designers, writers and advocates what changes they would like to seeWith much of the usual churn on pause because of coronavirus and many of the cracks of the industry coming to the fore – not least in Bangladesh, where garment workers are facing destitution as big-name brands cancel their orders – some people in the industry are taking this hiatus as an opportunity to reassess fashion’s direction of travel.From a change in consumer attitudes to a slowing down of the seasonal model or an uptick in respect for the garment workers that power it, we asked some of the most respected names in the world of sustainable fashion what they hope the industry of the future will look like.Coronavirus is exposing the cracks in our system. As business is screeching to a halt, garment workers where I’m based in Los Angeles are facing unique circumstances. ⁣⁣Many earn an average of $6 an hour and face food insecurity, as well as inability to pay their rent, utilities and other bills due to loss of income.⁣⁣ Yet the continued demand for PPE orders means that many factories remain open.Many workers are navigating the sweatshop conditions they would face on any other day – except now, the risks of poor ventilation, dirty conditions and no social-distancing practices are exacerbating the risk of disease.Elsewhere in the world, we are seeing major brands pull out of orders using the contractual terms of force majeure. But if you look at who some of these brands are – H\u0026ampM, Target, Zara, C\u0026ampA – they have huge bottom lines.My hope for a post-coronavirus future is one that values those in the supply chain. Garment workers are the heart of the fashion industry but are treated the worst and often come from the most marginalised communities.Am I hopeful? On the one hand, many of us have been saying the same thing for years. But there is a shifting tide. It is a unique moment because consumers are paying attention and reorienting our relationship with consumption. Governments and corporations are being called out and garment workers are continuing to resist, as they always have.Now is the time to reimagine new systems. I am challenging myself and others – beyond these systems that we are critiquing, let’s propose alternatives. There is a meaningful transnational solidarity that can be done right now, from Los Angeles, from Bangladesh.My hope for the future is that fashion brands can put together better, more transparent supply chains. Many brands have long put forth that the reason they contract to factories in places such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia is to lift workers out of poverty and bring jobs to those regions. Yet the majority of these brands have cancelled their orders and threatened to withhold payments even for finished clothing, even though they have the money. They are thus throwing these countries into economic meltdown.With the factory closed and workers furloughed, now is the time to be replacing old machines with new, state-of-the-art, cleaner and safer systems. I hope brands will streamline and I hope there will be some near-shoring and re-shoring and right-shoring, because we are going to keep having crises like this and supply chains are such delicately balanced systems like dominoes, if one goes down, it all goes down.Brands need to not be so vulnerable by becoming more independent and, in a sense, more truly global. You have one third of your manufacturing in one part of the world, one third in another, another third in another some of it’s far, some of it’s close. Bring some manufacturing home instead – there is such great advantage to localising. But more than that, companies should take on the responsibility of looking after workers and making sure everything is sourced cleanly and leftovers are disposed of correctly.Before coronavirus we were already discussing the need to stop and reevaluate. But nobody was voluntarily going to stop, because it’s business. This has forced us to stop and even big conglomerates like LVMH are thinking: “What does fashion actually mean now?” This is going to make designers look introspectively and think: “How much am I going to make?”I am hopeful that it is going to allow us to redefine the fashion schedule. I was talking to Patrick McDowell, Bethany Williams and other young designers in London about getting tired of all the stuff we had to produce. Two collections a year is enough, without all the pre-collections. The BFC could put out a statement, setting out all the reasons why it makes sense – but it would need to be an international effort.I hope that because of this young and emerging designers might have more of a voice in the room when big decisions are being made about the industry. Coronavirus is pushing everything online and online platforms are giving people who potentially wouldn’t have had much of a say before, a massive say. Nobody is going to fashion week but Ahluwalia Studio just dropped the Matches collection through Instagram – it’s so much more powerful because it’s coming straight from the brand.Unfortunately it took a shock like this for companies to open their eyes and see that the systems they have built around profit and growth can crumble easily there isn’t any resilience and retail is being hit really hard. It feels like everything is opening up so it can be scrutinised and redesigned. We need to put the health of our ecosystems at the heart of our business systems. That means designing systems from a human, community-centred perspective rather than one that is profit-centred, like we have now with capitalism.Everyone can learn a lot from adopting a more resilient business model for example, businesses already built around a slow fashion mentality and sustainable growth, such as Eileen Fisher, are not being affected tremendously by this storm. The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community, planet, kindness, and ecosystems.We need to design a production model that doesn’t overproduce and over-manufacture because a system that yields over-consumption cannot last. I don’t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual. There are a lot of unions being formed, such as at Everlane, and there is growing solidarity among employees across companies. Right now we are seeing that collective action is not actually that difficult. There is only one way from here: up.The fashion industry is facing a massive crisis, but after a period of restriction we tend to fall back into excess. I anticipate that there will be a return to business as usual – and younger, emerging designers will need our support. But I also hope that we pause and realise we don’t necessarily need 12 pairs of jeans and God knows how many sweatpants.I hope it makes us value the concept of buying less, buying better and perhaps buying a little bit less cheap finding ways to be able to afford things that are locally made and from brands that are so small as to have innovation and sustainability embedded from the start. It’s a good opportunity to break the hegemony of the big guys, so that we won’t need to double check that Zara and H\u0026ampM really are doing what they say they are doing. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the high street didn’t return to the same-old same-old, but instead had mending services, smaller designers, tailors, rental places and swapping places.When we come out of this, it will be about capturing that joy of nothingness – the joy of having had less, of having been limited. I want people to focus on the positives in order to grow from it. Almost everybody has become an expert on coronavirus, so why not become an expert on sustainable fashion?The post Covid-19 future I want to live in is one where we take our time with our purchases and make more considered decisions about our spending carefully deciding whether we truly need the item and if the maker reflects our values. I essentially want to return to a post-fast fashion world.The companies that have used unethical labour and unsustainable practices need to either correct their issues fully or go away. The economy is delicate but I believe that supporting small businesses with ethics at their core will be the way to get ourselves out of this mess and rebuild a fashion industry we can all believe in. The lockdown has been a gigantic wakeup call for the industry. What we do next is equally as important.I believe this pandemic has made us realise that rather than seeking material things, we have found value in human connection more than ever. It took a pandemic for many of us to see the broken system behind our “stuff”: a system that says essential workers should keep us safe and fed, but without personal protective equipment, insurance or decent salaries a system that allows big corporation bailouts at the expense of our planet, clean air and our health. The list goes on.Yet, in the midst of the chaos and injustice, we are seeing iniduals and small businesses fill the gaps – from making or securing PPE, ventilators, and tests, to online movements like #payupfashion. The world we are after is unfolding right in front of us. What I’m hoping for is already happening: transparency, interconnectedness and human flourishing, which are all integral to building a circular economy.My hope is that we will be seeing a shift in values and consumer behaviour. We so often talk about the power of the consumer to change the fashion industry for the better and now is really the chance. While having been quarantined and experiencing a global crisis with devastating economic and social costs, I hope we have all had a wakeup call in terms of what really matters.With regards to fashion, I hope this means having a much bigger appreciation for fashion that is value-driven supporting the brands that are authentic, inclusive and transparent. Fashion that – a bit of a cliche perhaps - cares for the planet and people, and not only profit.During the five-week quarantine in Denmark, I bought a pair of (comfortable!) trousers. This purchase was a special one, because more than ever I reflected not on the usual things like fit, fabric, quality, colour – but rather: “Where should I put my money? Which brand to support?” I hope this will become the new normal, supporting the businesses that do it better. Let’s shift the focus away from ourselves and our self-centred needs, and think twice about our actions. Can purchasing a garment from a particular brand actually make a difference?My hope for fashion in a post Covid-19 world would be for the people who power supply chains – from retail, warehouse, to the factory floor – to be treated as assets rather than cost centres. I would hope to see sustainable brands that work in close partnership with worker-owned factories and unionised warehouses so that there are safety nets and protection for the people working across the fashion supply chain.With the pandemic, as fashion sales have contracted and retail stores have closed, brands have cancelled orders already in production, with suppliers fronting both material and labour cost. This liquidity crunch has resulted in millions of garment maker layoffs without severance, savings or access to healthcare. The women who have kept this industry profitable for decades have been left food-insecure and without safety nets. This is why at Remake we have been working tirelessly to engage brands with our #PayUp campaign.The pandemic has brought all of the broken systems to the surface. Looking at that through a positive lens, in all of this chaos there is an opportunity for us to redefine them. We know we are going to be going through breakdowns for the foreseeable future – either pandemic or environmental issues – so to try to get back to to the status quo would be crazy. People are going to have to put the planet before their idea of profits.For iniduals and businesses it’s about how to build the strongest boat to weather all storms. We are brainstorming around this right now. We are going to have to get off the schedule. It’s a precarious dance, because we still need money coming in, but is September going to mean us showing spring collections because we know that is where money could come in? Or are we willing to take those chances, not show up and forge our own way?One way of building a stronger vessel is through owning more of our business. We are focusing on the most solidified, transparent aspects of our existing one and leaning into those parts. The same applies with the fibres we use - where is that being grown, woven and cut? Some bigger companies will rather go back to a broken system than be in the discomfort of pioneering. But it’s going to take everyone being willing to risk new ways of doing things. Maybe that’s going to mean less money and that’s OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0126f5e0d6a532d5c48167a9cda0a700d13a7c54/162_69_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa921a38c1275c126713c8c3edd16c1","title":"the easy bit review ivf documentary fertility treatment","story":"This well-intentioned documentary about the first step in fertility treatment has moments of humour but is too emotionally hectoringTom Webb’s documentary about men’s experiences of fertility treatment is a well-intentioned film on a valid subject – but I found it flawed, over-reliant on six talking heads, almost to the exclusion of any other explanatory style. Webb speaks to six men whose partners are undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a notoriously painful, upsetting, intimately invasive procedure.Men often don’t know how to express their feelings, or indeed if they are allowed to have feelings. They do what appears to be “the easy bit” in fertility treatment – supplying the sperm and then waiting while the woman goes through the incomparably more challenging business of IVF and then (they hope) pregnancy and childbirth.Men often don’t want to talk about their own frustration and sorrow at the many setbacks, and not necessarily because they’re emotionally illiterate – they want to be quietly supportive for their partners. Webb’s film is simply dominated by these talking heads, interspersed with educational-video-style talks about what happens.This approach was unvarying and emotionally hectoring, especially when Webb switches to the men talking in voiceover while showing these faces in closeup doing a slow blink and then a mute soulfulsad face. However, there is humour, especially when one man remembers realising that the room in which he was expected to produce the sample was the same one in which he had the initial consultation.

Each one is like Narnia: from the outside, you would not know of the vast world that lies behind. There are thigh-high buckets full of rice and chapati flour, three-litre jars (four across and four deep) of all the pulses, rice and spices available in the modern world, and a whole shelf dedicated to value kitchen roll.In her defence, her family, like many political refugees, have seen real hardship and her bulk-buying comes, in part, from needing to find a smarter way to cook and save, but also from a deep-seated fear, much like we’re all experiencing now, of potentially going hungry.It’s safe to say the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, and I love to cook from the store-cupboard – it gives me an enormous thrill to conjure up a meal made from dormant grains and tins.

Meera SodhaKA: You can swap out the choi sum for any greens and the sake for dry sherry.Kitchen Aide: This would work with just about any bean, whether tinned or dried (and soaked and cooked first, of course). If allspice is scarce, try a mixture of equal parts ground nutmeg, cinnamon and clove and use parsley (or, indeed, any fresh herb you fancy) instead of the coriander.KA: For when you can’t get to Wagamama… you can sub the panko for normal breadcrumbs and pickle whatever vegetable takes your fancy, if you can’t find radishes.KA: Use any thin pasta in place of the vermicelli orzo would be another option. And if you can’t get green beans, try courgette batons or asparagus instead, though those both need less cooking, or they’ll turn to absolute mush.KA: Sub out purple sprouting broccoli for normal broccoli, brown rice syrup for brown sugar, Thai basil for basil leaves. If you want to keep ginger and Thai chillies for longer, prep and freeze the ginger in portions, and freeze the Thai chillies as they are.KA: Sub the fennel for more broccoli, or even tomatoes (or anything else you have, such as celery, carrots or peppers).KA: If chard proves hard to come by, just use another green instead: mature spinach or savoy cabbage, say, or kale, in which case it will need more cooking – a five-minute blanch and refresh should do it.KA: There are as many variations on the tikki as there are people who eat them – mix and match to suit tastes and availability.KA: No butter, no eggs, no raising agent. If you don’t have the passion fruit, it doesn’t matter – either leave it out or swap in some other tart or acidic fruit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a4f38f9ef901f9bcc2ef13414a77e3bd6146ef/567_202_5436_3261/master/5436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5fc9ec0af730262f62c41f3cf538515","title":"kim joys recipe for lemon and rose tofu cheesecake","story":"The flavours shine in this simple, creamy cake, which can be made with vegan cream cheese if you preferThis cheesecake is made with tofu, which gives it a nice and creamy texture.

You can always substitute some of the silken tofu for vegan or dairy cream cheese. I enjoy the simplicity of this version, which lets the lemon and rosewater flavours shine.

Meanwhile, make the edible decorations. Cut simple petal shapes from the wafer paper, then use a paintbrush to very lightly wet these. Paint using food dye mixed with a little water. When the wafer paper is wet, you will be able to shape it so that it looks more realistic. For the stem make a long stem shape painted brown.

It has appealed not only to the league but to the respective chairmen of the top ision’s clubs, highlighting what it says is a threat their intellectual property – and incomes.Nonetheless, sources working on the takeover remain confident there will be no last-minute hitches, hinting that Premier League checks that have been under way for a fortnight are approaching a conclusion. It has also been noted that, despite similar concerns, the Premier League approved Sheffield United’s transfer into full Saudi ownership last year.The Premier League, along with other domestic governing bodies and rights holders, has previously urged Arabsat, the Saudi state satellite broadcaster which transmits across the Arab world, to withdraw a framework for a pirate network known as beoutQ that they argued was abusing the game. It started its illegal streaming activities in 2017, the year Saudi and Qatar became involved in a significant political argument with assorted international ramifications, and no one has succeeded in halting the transmissions.Last July the Premier League said it had spoken to nine law firms in Saudi Arabia who either refused to act or later recused themselves when asked about pursuing a copyright complaint against beoutQ.“Furthermore – given the crippling economic effect that coronavirus is having on the sports industry – this is all happening at a time when football clubs need to protect their broadcast revenue the most.”In a separate letter to Richard Masters, the Premier League’s chief executive, Obaidly reminded him of the perceived threat to intellectual property posed by the Newcastle deal, the “direct role of Saudi Arabia in the launch, promotion and operation of the beoutQ service” and “the challenge the Premier League itself has faced and will continue to face in taking any action to protect its own intellectual property rights in the country”.Newcastle – whose outgoing owner Mike Ashley is in the United States – and the Premier League have declined to comment on the issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fc46bb4c1d8ee2c195585253b3aa42e059be2f0/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04e1db6f423f40ffdda13889a5cfbf1","title":"football quiz top goalscorers","story":"How much do you know about the great plunderers of our time?

Sometimes, when we think back on past events, we remember incorrect details with certainty, our brains blending truth and untruth: things we witnessed first-hand with stories we have been told since.Is it still right to call the memory false, though, if we have deliberately allowed it to be distorted in this way? I know I watched Italy’s 2006 World Cup semi-final win over Germany on ITV, on a shared television in temporary halls of residence at Highbury College in Portsmouth. I was studying for my NCTJ journalism qualifications and we had been booted out of our previous accommodation due to a double-booking right before starting our exams.Yet when I think back on Fabio Grosso’s extra-time goal, it is not the voice of Clive Tyldesley I hear. Instead, the backing track is Fabio Caressa of Italy’s Sky Sport, screaming himself hoarse. “The ball is cut out. It’s Pirlo, Pirlo, Pirlo, still Pirlo, heel, shot ... GOOOOAL! GOOOOAL! GOOOOAL! Grosso! Grosso! GOOOOAL! Goal from Grosso! Goal from Grosso! Goal from Grosso! One minute left!”There is no clever wordplay, no crafted metaphor or iconic line. Yet Caressa’s commentary was perfection because it captured the moment so absolutely. He was exhausted and exhilarated, running on fumes and emotion. So was Grosso, as he wheeled away screaming “I can’t believe it” – his outstretched arms and shaking head evoking memories of Marco Tardelli24 years before.So, frankly, were the rest of us. These had been 119 of the most intense World Cup minutes: a relentless back-and-forth between two of the sport’s foremost nations. The game remained deadlocked only because Lukas Podolski couldn’t beat Gianluigi Buffon at the end of a five-on-five, while Alberto Gilardino and Gianluca Zambrotta hit the woodwork of a goal they concluded to be cursed.By the time Italy scored, they had four centre-forwards on the pitch. Marcello Lippi sent on Vincenzo Iaquinta to replace one winger at the start of extra time and then Alessandro Del Piero for the other in the 104th minute. Gilardino had already come on for Luca Toni in a like-for-like swap, while Francesco Totti played the full duration. So, of course, the stalemate had to be broken by a left-back.His shot was curled on an unstoppable trajectory round the despairing e of Jens Lehmann but Grosso never sought to claim it as some moment of nerveless skill. “I tried to hit the ball with whatever strength I had left,” he said. “Then, it went how it went.”There was genuine artistry in the assist from Pirlo, seizing the ball after it was headed clear from a corner. His first thought was to shoot, but with three defenders closing in on his touch he released Grosso instead using a no-look pass. “He always used to tell me to ‘just go’,” said the full-back. “He would say: ‘I’ll find a way to see you.’”The epilogue was almost as perfect. Not long after the restart, Fabio Cannavaro intercepted a cross and charged forward with inexplicable energy to win the ball again from Podolski 10 yards ahead. Italy broke and Gilardino demonstrated impressive cool of his own to cut a reverse pass for Del Piero, who beat Lehmann.As an Italian, it was perfect: 118 minutes of suffering all made worthwhile by the last two. A win, a place in the World Cup final, another excuse to dance around to Seven Nation Army in that summer when it had become our song and not yet just another generic stadium tune.In Portsmouth, a group of Italian schoolkids spilled out of a neighbouring hall of residence – where they were staying while doing a language course.

Currently at 19 years with a missing end,” writes James Pollard, while David Calboutin recalls some lengthy inactivity in the north-east. “Newcastle demolished The Leazes End in 1978 as part of a big plan to redevelop the ground. Unfortunately we were relegated and rebuilding was shelved until 1993, leaving a temporary terrace for 15 years, when the new stand was eventually built.”“Which teams have been sponsored by products that don’t exist any more and which team has been sponsored by the most defunct products?” muses Noble Francis.We thought this sounded familiar. But there are earlier instances. Gareth Vaughan goes back to the 1980s: “I recall being told that West Brom were sponsored in 1984-85 by a public health warning to stop smoking. Given smoking is now prohibited in most work and internal public places, I wondered if this fits this description?” Meanwhile, Richard Young adds: “Northern Rock at Newcastle United … Hopefully shortly also Mike Ashley, on several levels.”Chelsea started the Premier League era bearing the logo of a sadly departed company on their chests, writes Stuart Goodwin. “Unbelievably to many who remember their computing heyday with the C64 and Amiga, but Commodore went out of business within 12 months of the completion of Premier League season v1.0,” he notes. “Commodore International’s demise in April 1994 also meant that Chelsea took the pitch for the following month’s FA Cup final wearing the badge of a company that no longer existed. In a similar vein, Crystal Palace went into the Premier League era sponsored by Tulip Computers – the Dutch company went under in 2009.”“In 2011, I heard rumours about the owner of American wrestling company WWE, Vince McMahon, trying to buy Newcastle United,” mailed Morten Hansen in January 2014. “Is this true?”It’s hard to tell where the rumour linking Vince McMahon, CEO and chairman of WWE, with Newcastle came from, but it didn’t take long to spread all over Twitter and start to creep in to the football news consciousness. The Newcastle Chronicle duly put the question to the club, but the official response was to brand the story “nonsense” and refuse to comment further. So the whole thing died almost as quickly as it had sprung in to life. And really, it’s difficult to see how a rumour linking Sensible Mike’s club with the man in charge of this sort of pantomime can ever have gained any traction.As an adjunct to the question on defunct sponsors, Simon Bradley asks: “Who are the most successful shirt sponsors, in terms of honours won? Of course, this is an inexact science, as determining the comparative value of different trophies is highly debatable. But off the top of my head: Sharp must be up there, having sponsored Manchester United during their 90s glory days Carling cleaned up pretty much every trophy going in Scotland by sponsoring both Old Firm teams between 2003 and 2010 and Emirates Airline have four Champions Leagues with Real Madrid, as well as surely a clutch of other honours from various deals across Europe.”“Which professional club has the longest-standing record transfer purchase fee?” wonders Dan Weaver. “My guess is my club Wrexham with Joey Jones, when we were buying players from the European Cup holders, for £220,000 back in 1978.”“Who were the last father and son combination to play in the same team in the Football League?” mails George Read.“Wolves’ Europa League shirt is inspired by the traditional Mexican national team jersey, associated with our record signing Raúl Jiménez,” writes Miles Johnson. “Are there any other instances where a club has released a kit to honour a national team or nation itself? Didn’t Crystal Palace once have a Brazil national team-inspired away kit or something?”“What is the record number of consecutive successful penalties in shootouts in the same type of competition?” asks Richard Askham. “Huddersfield obviously hold the record in Football League play-offs, with 12 (and also the next best with 11). I suspect that Germany in World Cups and Euros will have an unbeatable record and I remember Ivory Coast scoring 12 or more in an Africa Cup of Nations shoot-out.”“Who is the shortest goalkeeper to play in either the old First Division or the Premier League? My guess it was Laurie Sivell who kept goal for Ipswich Town in the 70s,” writes Mitch Mitchell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones.

Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times.

The two women then did it together, breathing slowly and intentionally in sync.Breathwork is one of the tools that Douthit, 56, often reaches for when soothing clients. But this time, instead of sitting in the same room inhaling the same air, the women breathed together on Zoom.“It’s devastating, right? I mean, you built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can’t,” she told me.As Covid-19 changes the way women experience pregnancy, doulas like Douthit are caught between a calling to guide their clients through childbirth and the limitations caused by the pandemic. Many hospitals across the country now limit visitors to just the mother-to-be and her partner in the delivery room, meaning doulas, who are recognized by hospitals only as visitors, are forced to support births virtually or not at all. Some are organizing and pushing back on hospital policies that exclude them from delivery rooms, but therein lies an ethical question: at what point does advocating for recognition and respect outweigh the risks of exposing others to the virus as non-medical visitors in a hospital? It’s a debate saddled with historical tension between doulas and the western obstetrical healthcare system.For now, doulas are hastily translating their intimate and hands-on work on to impersonal virtual platforms, and preparing their clients for giving birth without them physically present. “We’re trying to scramble to give support in a different way, and learn a new skill set really quickly,” says Raychel Franzen, a New York-based doula. “I think one of the things that a doula brings to their clients is a calm energy. We can still do that with facial expressions on a video call, but the energy exchange is just a little bit different.”Gwynne Knap, an Atlanta-based doula, is also a faculty member of Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (Cappa), one of a few organizations nationwide that certifies doulas. Recently, Knap’s work has revolved around teaching fellow doulas how to shift their offerings to reflect the circumstances – Cappa has developed resources and suggestions for doulas to support their clients virtually, such as having the woman’s partner wear an earbud, the doula coaching through contractions over the phone. But some techniques used by birth workers to calm and comfort women during labor, like hand-holding and eye contact, are impossible to translate. “A labor doula helps the mom a lot with comfort and suggested positions, but she also calms the partner so they can be more emotionally present,” says Knap. “When the doula’s not there, it’s very hard to do that.”While some doulas have shifted to virtual support, others are pushing back against the new hospital policies and argue that hospitals shouldn’t lump doulas in as regular “visitors”, but rather as critical to ensure the mother’s health. These doulas, along with birth advocacy groups, are organizing virtual town halls to strategize a unified pushback, circulating petitions against inidual hospital policies, and distributing scripts for doulas to use when speaking to hospital administrators about the potentially harmful implications of restricting doulas from labor units. In some cases, that advocacy has resulted in hospitals adjusting their visitor policy to allow doulas, in addition to a partner or support person, on the labor floor.“It’s not a bonus or a luxury for someone to have care that is safe and respectful,” says Cristen Pascucci, founder of Birth Monopoly, an online advocacy organization that focuses on birthing rights. They argue that for some patients, doulas are an essential part of ensuring a healthy, safe birth – especially for marginalized populations like women of color, particularly black women, who bear the brunt of the maternal mortality crisis in America. There is evidence that continuous, one-on-one birthing support, particularly from a doula, reduces the risk of dissatisfying or traumatic birth experiences, unplanned C-sections and low Apgar scores – the method physicians use to assess a newborn’s health immediately after birth.“There are people who, I feel comfortable saying, have to have a doula to have a safe birth,” Pascucci says. For women of color and low-income women, who statistically face bias from healthcare workers, and who suffer higher maternal mortality rates and worse birth outcomes as a result, a doula can act as a crucial mediator. Many doulas work closely with their clients to inform them about their rights as patients, and talk through the questions they can ask their providers about interventions before they happen.She adds: “Doulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years. Now we have a crisis and the same system that doulas have been making up for, the first chance it got, was like, we still don’t know what you do and we still don’t appreciate you. So all of those gaps that doulas were filling are back.”For other nurses working on the frontlines, it’s a tough call. One labor and delivery nurse in New Orleans, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her job, understands that she can never replace the role of a doula in the delivery room. “Doulas provide an excellent service in that one-on-one care,” she says. “As a nurse, I can’t be in there to get you through every contraction.”Her hospital’s labor and delivery unit, which previously had minimal restrictions on non-patient visitors, now only allows one support person a patient, and only when they’re actively in labor. (A patient kept overnight for blood pressure monitoring, for example, cannot have any visitors.) She has had to field frantic phone calls from women asking for their doula to be allowed in, only to tell them no. “I think it’s thrown a lot of women – this is their plan, and everything has been thrown off,” she says. “I think about how scary that must be.”On the other hand, she works in a city besieged by the virus. Every unit of her hospital, which is full, has been overrun with Covid-19 patients (including some in labor and delivery), and the hospital has run out of personal protective equipment for its staff.“We’re struggling,” she says. “We’re told to reuse our masks. We’re told to wipe down our plastic gowns between uses. It’s a very somber walk into the hospital each day. Because of what I’ve seen, I think the fewer people in the hospital, the better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adcc055d97a72838257412d633d6fda2ec3381c/0_895_5546_3326/master/5546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5ee56ffb3f78f6fac779a508e3fcdf","title":"self isolation is bringing out the worst in some how do we avoid conflict","story":"Things are tough right now, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith, but we must try to keep contempt at bayThese days of self-isolation are bringing out the worst in some people. With very little warning that can go off like a bomb. I fear that as these weeks of lockdown drag on, this sort of surprise misbehaving and mistreatment of others will only get worse. Not only by those loved ones who we are in quarantine with, but neighbours, colleagues and other acquaintances that we happen to cross paths with through email, Zoom, etc. How do we avoid conflict with people at this time?The first thing dozens of spouses did when they got out of isolation in Wuhan was file for orce. Children moved out of parental homes and swore not to speak to family again. I think a lot of us are afraid that isolation might cause this kind of collapse in our closest relationships. Not through fights or conscious decisions, but through the “everything and nothing” cataclysms that wait for us when we just handle each day a little badly and let the days add up.You don’t need me to tell you that things are tough right now. The problem is that while “things are tough right now” is usually a reason to go a little easy and ask a little less of each other, this “right now” might be several months long.Usually we can put off emotional things until we feel better – until we’ve slept, eaten and exercised – but this foul mood won’t be so easily lifted. So we need to find a way to do two things at once: honestly feel and acknowledge the ways this pandemic is fraying our mental edges, and find more to say in response than “it’s only for now”.One place to start is with vigilant attention to what we allow as normal. Do not permit small expressions of contempt. Anger, frustration, sadness, blame – yes, but never contempt. Keep contempt out of your home and you’ll have a difference in the kind – not just degree – of your fights and the curdled sprawls that ruin families. Don’t just take it in your stride when people speak to you in ways you don’t like – act surprised. Surprise marks clear edges around what we expect of our relationships, and communicating that “this isn’t normal” is often an effective way of communicating “it shouldn’t be”.Another place to start is something that can sound naff but I promise works: focus on the ways differences can be strengths. We’re not very good at understanding other people’s reactions to crises, and we don’t feel understood when they don’t share ours. But there’s strength in the fact that we react differently. Maybe you can’t stand your mother’s over-stocking of the fridge. Maybe your husband’s insistence on routine seems too stiff-upper-lip. But if we focus on being grateful to her for keeping us fed, and to him for keeping us moving, then maybe they can learn to be grateful for whatever your reaction gives them that they wouldn’t have alone. A pandemic is a good time to stand back-to-back with people who have skills you don’t.And talk. We have to talk. If people can’t ask directly for what they need they’ll either manipulate it out of other people or silently resent that they’re not getting it. Practice honestly asking, and honestly telling: do each other the service of hoping those conversations can be productive.We are all going to find ourselves and the people we love behaving in some profoundly unlikable ways. But the mission isn’t to like each other, it’s to love each other, which is much harder – and much more likely to get us through.

Next up: the LA metal band who made the sky pour with bloodReign in Blood (1986)In 1986, thrash truly emerged from its classic, generally British, heavy metal influences, with the “big four” – LA’s Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and NYC’s Anthrax – all finding their sound. Metallica emphasised a paranoid grind, Anthrax a tongue-in-cheek, streetwise hardcore bounciness, and Megadeth a remnant of old-school, hard-rock boogie Slayer, however, distilled and concentrated the essence of pure metal: the crystal meth to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest’s medical Dexedrine. Every blastbeat and guitar widdle is faster, every scream higher, every grunt lower, every mood either assault or preparation for assault, and the subject matter is boiled down to Satan, slaughter and pain. All of metal’s preposterous theatre and grandiosity is here, but at only 28 minutes from the first everyone-hitting-everything stab of Angel of Death to the final trickle of Raining Blood, it’s perfectly nasty, brutish and short.Those two tracks are the classics that never left Slayer sets. Yes, Angel of Death is about Nazi surgeon Josef Mengele no, Slayer are not Nazis, any more than they are Wahabbists for writing Jihad from the point of view of a 911 hijacker in 2006. In fact, their politics seem to lean to the oafish side of libertarianism. Like the rest of the album, Angel of Death is a schlock slasher movie, to the bone. Raining Blood, meanwhile, is utterly thrilling: even the squeamish or metal-averse can get caught up by the sharp-toothed earworm riffs. The twin-lead intro emerging from thunder and rain is probably the ultimate metal moment for main songwriters and guitarists, Kerry King and the late Jeff Hanemann.But there’s not a weak link on the album. Necrophobic is under two minutes and rivals the UK grindcore acts emerging at the time for speed. Altar of Sacrifice is three minutes of perfect momentum, not a second to take a breath, just a constant rockfall of noise, perfectly controlled then grinding to a halt in the final seconds. It also features singer Tom Araya at his shoutiest, part of an undercurrent of hardcore and anarcho-crust-punk rage that always simmers beneath the metallic surfaces in Slayer. Epidemic is the closest to classic Brit metal, but it’s done with such confidence that they’re owning the sound rather than paying homage to Maiden. And on it goes. Rick Rubin’s production and the band’s incredible ear for structure means that, aside from all the theatre, lyrical dumb-assery and athletic virtuosity, it can – even now – be appreciated on an immediate, unconscious level as a pure sonic rush.Seasons in the Abyss (1990)Slayer were not the heaviest, the fastest nor the most revolting extreme metal band. They were quickly outflanked in the gruesomeness race by Death, Carcass and Cannibal Corpse, and in speed terms by Napalm Death, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror. But nobody else hit that sweet spot between metal histrionics and pure grunting bestial racket as precisely as Slayer. While they tried to ersify and even mellow on South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss is the sound of them realising that they’re at their swaggering best going all-out. There is still some subdued grind here, but it’s the proper rippers, such as War Ensemble and Hollowed Point, that make it. It’s also got some of Slayer’s most fun sonics: the way lead guitar notes leap out of the surge of churning riff like spurts of lava from a boiling hellscape demonstrates their key skill of making extreme musicianship come off as audacity rather than onanism.Appropriately for a band who take metal to the nth degree, Slayer’s career has been turbulent – from Lombardo’s multiple splits from the band to Hanneman’s troubles with arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, and the alcoholism that eventually killed him. But, despite all this, their output has been remarkably consistent. Their only real fallow patch was the second half of the 90s, when they released only the decent enough punk covers album, Undisputed Attitude, and the sadly nu-metal-influenced Diabolus in Musica. But with God Hates Us All they returned to form spectacularly. Apart from religious psychosis replacing the slasher imagery, it’s vintage Slayer. Lombardo’s stand-in, Paul Bostaph, is especially keen to prove his worth. The sheer inhuman barrage of blastbeats on Disciple is one of the most adrenalising sounds in their catalogue, and even a slow track such as Seven Faces takes a terrifying pummelling. From here on, they kept delivering, with 2009’s World Painted Blood – reconstituting the original lineup – an especially tight collection. Even their 2015 swansong, Repentless, though derided by metal critics as unadventurous at the time, still stands up as a top-drawer thrash record.If ever there was a record that delivered the stink and bruises of the moshpit, this is it. Though the debut album Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits which followed in 1985 both show Slayer pushing at the boundaries of what metal could achieve, it’s clear that their live shows was where they truly cut loose: this is the lightning that they would finally successfully bottle on Reign in Blood. The total meshing of guitar maelstrom, Lombardo’s machine-like kickdrum rolls, and Araya’s Rob Halford scream at the climax of Antichrist must have been staggering to experience in the flesh, and it’s no wonder the roar of the crowd, audible throughout, is so deranged.South of Heaven (1988)While many bands insist that their latest album is their best, King has admitted, with an impressive lack of ego, that he was fine with the idea they might never top Reign in Blood. Nonetheless, it took them a while to get past its brilliance. With all eyes on them – thanks not only to Reign’s success but to the meteoric rise of Rick Rubin and Def Jam – they chose not to replicate the previous glory but to slow things down. Oddly, it kind of sounds like Slayer making a Metallica album. It rarely takes flight like their best, but it is a fantastic record. It is more trad metal than Reign, but it still has the swaggering confidence to the playing – and it might even be a good point of introduction for the timid.In Tribute: The Complete, Untold Story of Slayer’s Jeff Hanneman, by Jeff Kitts (2015)This memorial piece, published in Guitar World a year after Hanneman’s death, is a perfect intro to Slayer’s dysfunctional world, and to Hanneman’s sweetly domesticated off stage life as well as his tragic decline. Contains the perfectly metal phrase: “Jeff pretty much only went to war museums, as you can imagine.”Slayer 66 23: The Jeff \u0026amp Dave Years. A Metal Band Biography: Post-Repentless Remastered Edition, by DX Ferris (2018)Three hundred and fifty pages of precisely the sort of exhaustive detail that metal fans demand about “37 years in the Abyss”, this is the most complete and up to date Slayer text. Even includes Hanneman’s stick-figure concept drawings for the Live Undead picture disc.The Bloody Reign of Slayer, by Joel McIver (2010)Joel McIver is the rock biographer of our times, with books on Black Sabbath, Metallica and Queens of the Stone Age (and Ice Cube!) under his belt, all beloved because he writes for fans as an unabashed fan.

Just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session - a “hybrid” system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before.First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it worked without a hitch.More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much under-rated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over.Under the old PMQs MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a “winner” at PMQs. (Journalists like me wrote it up like in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone “winning” old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well suited to parliament in seriousboring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today’s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today.People said that we couldn’t build a hospital in this country at that kind of speed, and we’ve built several, with more to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3749db60f42fb47b8db2f55e1ff9f6f0fec7e2/0_0_2441_1003/master/2441.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e63306fcaf60cef0683847a56a3cfb45 940w","title":"referees need supporting too lockdown tests rugby league officials","story":"Officials face a challenge to keep fit and focused in readiness for eventual return but are keeping themselves busy – and usefulWhen the Rugby Football League furloughed its refereeing department shortly after the suspension of the domestic league season last month, its nine full-time officials and numerous support staff suddenly found themselves stood down. While the players’ welfare has been in the spotlight during the pandemic, the men in the middle will be no different but face an arguably more daunting task to be ready when the time comes to start up again.“I guess it’s easy to think these lads aren’t human at times when they’re getting horrendous abuse from the terraces, but they need supporting as much as the players do,” says the RFL’s head of match officials, Steve Ganson.A full-time referee earns considerably less than an average Super League player, but is still subject to a gruelling conditioning to meet the demands of officiating an often relentless sport. Players have been given training schedules and even equipment to keep them in shape, but the referees have far fewer resources at their disposal.“When they get furloughed, it means we can’t send them training programmes,” says Ganson, a former high-profile official. “They’ve got to adapt, use their own initiative and be professional. They know we’re going to need them on form when they come back because it’s going to be chaotic, but I’m confident in the commitment they show that they will return from this strongly.”Some referees have been busier than others during lockdown. Chris Kendall, who officiated the Super League Grand Final last year, has filled his impromptu off-season with running, cycling and, perhaps most importantly, community spirit aplenty in his hometown of Huddersfield.“Myself and my girlfriend have both signed up for the NHS volunteer scheme and our local council are wanting volunteers, too,” he says. “We’ve got some elderly neighbours who we’re delivering food and daily essentials to. I just want to keep people going throughout these difficult times what I’m doing is pretty insignificant compared to the frontline workers.”With rugby league likely to play multiple games each week when the season eventually returns, officials will see their workload doubled, plus there is added mental pressure. “They run around six or seven miles a game on average, but they will have hundreds of rucks and plays to rule over too, plus the abuse and pressure which comes with the territory,” Ganson says.“The mental toll officiating takes on you is enormous. We have a psychologist who works with the full-time officials and he will be crucial to look after their mental wellbeing when we start again. If they’re officiating two or three games a week, we will have to dramatically change our training. There will have to be a welfare programme there for them and we’ll ensure they’re ready.”Kendall agrees there will need to be a considered approach to how referees can cope with the fresh demands placed on them. “We’re the pantomime villains to many but we are trying our best, and we’re under stress out there too. We are going to need a few weeks of pre-season and hopefully people will see we’re having to go through the same level of stress to get ourselves ready to go again.”Coronavirus will bring lasting change to rugby league’s landscape – and it has already had a profound effect on the RFL’s refereeing staff before lockdown Ganson feared he may have contracted the virus, sending the governing body’s headquarters into panic.“We’d been skiing in Lombardy and a few days later my wife wasn’t too well,” he recalls. “My doctor told me to go home from work immediately, and they sent an ambulance crew in hazmat suits for me, my wife and my youngest child on 23 February. I remember it vividly: it was horrendous. Where we’d been, in Lombardy, everyone was going about their business as usual and it was a 36-hour wait before the test came back negative. It was a very nervy couple of days, and because I’d been in work I’d come into contact with a lot of people.”Even now, Ganson’s personal scare acts as a sobering reminder as to how immaterial sport is at present. But the day will arrive when players take to the field again and referees become, as Kendall admits, the pantomime villains all over again. They, just like the players, will need to be supported.“People tell me referees don’t care about their work – that couldn’t be further from the truth,” Ganson insists. “They work in the community all the time, and they’re human beings like the rest of us. Hopefully that’s remembered when we get going again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5312b71d571f2928af743e2a36a6fcdac2e6a47d/0_119_4929_2960/master/4929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e69c1fd747c471e9f8d62cb84be8ee49","title":"why the nfls lockdown draft may be the oddest and best yet","story":"With the pandemic shutting down most of America, this year’s star prospects will discover their new teams by video linkIt’s almost inconceivable now to think that this week’s NFL draft was supposed to take place amid the glitz of Las Vegas. Parties galore. Drafted players hugging the commissioner with the Bellagio fountains dancing in the background. A cacophony of cheers and boos from a packed crowd.Then came Covid-19. Now, aside from the dates (23-25 April), everything about the three-day spectacle has changed. It will instead take place in a virtual format with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell’s basement serving as the new stage.In a normal year, viewers in the US would have their choice of three different broadcasts, from ESPN, NFL Network and ABC (an option introduced last year and geared toward casual fans).Given the new, post-lockdown landscape, NFL Network and ESPN decided to merge their resources into one unified broadcast from ESPN HQ in Bristol, Connecticut. A barren studio will be graced solely by Trey Wingo. Suzy Kolber will conduct player interviews (by video) while an array of reporters and analysts will participate from home. Talent from the two networks will be mixed and matched. This means that ESPN’s Mel Kiper and NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah, typically competitors in the draft space, will likely appear on air together. “The idea is to use the people and their expertise regardless of which network we work for,” says NFL Network executive Mark Quenzel. “This is the best thing for NFL fans.”Since media is deemed an essential business, there will be producers running both the ESPN and ABC telecasts from a control room in Bristol. But the number will be half of a typical crew and, as mandated by the state of Connecticut, they must maintain social distance and wear face coverings. Communicating in real time through a mask to an army of feeds projected to be somewhere between 170 and 180 will pose quite the challenge.The 58 prospects invited to attend the virtual draft will double as cameramen. The NFL is counting on each player to set up two cameras. One for up-close reaction shots, the other a wide shot of the room. NFL agent Nicole Lynn, who represents tackle Jedrick Wills and quarterback Jalen Hurts, says her clients were told the wide-shot camera will capture them simulating the traditional “walk to the stage”. At that point they will have some type of congratulatory virtual interaction with Goodell.Well, everything. During the first of several trial runs, there were reportedly multiple issues from general managers not muting themselves during a conference call to problems with bandwidth.The league’s tech wizards will be working overtime to minimize the issues but technology and uncharted waters don’t often mix well.Then there are the prospects themselves. A player could mistakenly curse on camera – an understandable reaction if you’ve just been drafted by the New York Jets. He could also, God forbid, drink a brand of soda that isn’t an official NFL sponsor. He could break lockdown restrictions by sneaking some buddies in to celebrate. Most likely, we’ll see a litany of minor technical bumps. Last Friday’s WNBA virtual draft featured everything from glitchy screens to newly drafted Chennedy Carter putting her commissioner interview on speaker phone, causing a severe echo.“Clearly we’re there to draft players but more clearly we’re setting the tone that we understand there’s something much larger going on in the world,” says Quenzel of NFL Network. To that end, the NFL is turning its three-day event into a Draft-a-Thon where viewers can donate to help with Covid-19 relief efforts. The charity drive will feature a collection of celebrities and athletes such as Deion Sanders and Kevin Hart. Quenzel says the broadcast will place an equal emphasis on soliciting donations and saying a “proper thank you” to first responders, grocery store workers and other professionals risking their lives to keep society running.Back in March, multiple general managers, including the Saints’ Mickey Loomis, pushed to have the draft postponed. But that was never a serious consideration for the 32 NFL team owners, who voted unanimously to proceed as scheduled.“It’s important to have normalcy,” Goodell told NFL Network’s Rich Eisen last week. “We’re doing this in a way that demonstrates that you can continue to do what you need to do in this country and do it safely at home.”The league’s show-must-go-on mentality extends to the regular season.

Dorough said he only learned of the Kemp’s announcement after an aide caught the press conference on TV.“I’m flabbergasted that the governor would say we can’t take additional precautions to protect our citizens,” Dorough told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “This isn’t a mixed signal. It’s a U-turn.”Citing “more than 19,000 Georgians” who have tested positive for coronavirus, Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, who is black, said in a statement she “will continue to urge Atlanta to stay at home, stay safe and make decisions based on the best interests of their families”.On Monday, Bottoms unveiled her own advisory council for reopening, independent of state guidance.Institutional healthcare inequities exacerbate the death rate. Cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, facility closures and caps on public health insurance plans make African Americans twice as likely to lack health insurance compared with their white counterparts.Georgia, the US’s eighth largest state, has one of the highest numbers of confirmed cases in its region. More than 700 people have died the state has one of the slowest testing rates.Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that cases in Georgia more than doubled in less than two weeks, from 7,300 on 6 April to just over 18,000 by Sunday.Abrams said ordering businesses to reopen would therefore put Georgia’s communities at risk.“These businesses that are reopening are going to force frontline workers back to work without having been tested, without having access to a healthcare system to help them if they are in need,” she said.The US south presents the “perfect storm of characteristics to just be a tragic region in terms of the Covid outbreak”, said Thomas LaVeist, dean of public health and tropical medicine at Tulane University.Kemp acknowledged the possible consequences of his reopening order.“When we have more people moving around we’re probably going to see cases continue to go up,” he said. “But we’re a lot better prepared for that now than a month ago.”Kemp denied accusations that his reopening order was a coordinated move in support of Donald Trump, who has expressed support for rightwing demands to reopen states for business.“I don’t give a damn about politics right now,” Kemp said.For much of the outbreak, Georgia did not know the race of some residents tested for the coronavirus, as drive-thru testing sites were not collecting that data.A Journal-Constitution investigation found that the state left race off of its own testing registration form. The error was only corrected after the paper informed the state department of public health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b1c76f57d0483b41c5e4952c1d1084f9d572203/0_55_3465_2079/master/3465.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9abd4d89d09baf94a0936c2b203b166e","title":"us troop levels afghanistan iraq syria military foia","story":"Freedom of information request filed after Pentagon stopped publishing figures for Afghanistan, Iraq and SyriaThe Trump administration is being challenged to reveal how many troops the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and to explain why it stopped publishing those figures more than two years ago.“The United States Government and all its institutions represent and are accountable to the American people,” the former defence secretary Chuck Hagel wrote in support of the requests. “The public and those who serve and defend this country and their families are entitled to know where we are sending our service men and women, why, and the numbers. That’s democracy. The Government works for the people.”Ryan Goodman, the co-editor of Just Security and a former Pentagon legal adviser said: “Providing this information would be a show of respect for the American public, who ultimately must decide what sacrifices our country should make in sending troops into war.”The administration’s decision to stop publishing troop numbers ended a decade-long policy of transparency started in the George W Bush administration. In December 2017, the Pentagon’s defence manpower data centre published its quarterly report with blank spaces where troop numbers in combat zones would normally be. Corresponding figures for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were also stripped retroactively from the previously released September report.The decision to remove the data from the Pentagon website was the initiative of former defence secretary James Mattis, according to retired army Lt General Thomas Spoehr.“He became convinced the Department of Defence was revealing too much information publicly,” Spoehr, head of the center for national defense at the Heritage Foundation, said. “I could never find a written memo, but he essentially told all the services to clamp down on what they were releasing to the public.” In the move to greater secrecy, Mattis drew support from the president. In August 2017, Trump said in a speech in Virginia. “We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities … America’s enemies must never know our plans, or believe they can wait us out.”Goodman said such reasoning was contradictory. “I think the public justification has crystallized around the idea of operational security – ‘we don’t want to tell the enemy’ – in part because it is such an easy, off-the-shelf explanation to present,” he said. “But that makes no sense given the long period in which the military has released these numbers to the public without hesitation.”Spoehr argued that Mattis had gone too far in withdrawing information from the public domain, but argued for a compromise in which approximate figures were disclosed, and with greater secrecy for Syrian operations, which tend to be more covert.Troop numbers are also politically sensitive, particularly in an election year, as Trump has made his vows to bring US troops home from Afghanistan and the Middle East one of the central planks to his campaign message.“Of all the things that DoD has done to limit public access to information, this is probably the most egregious,” said Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists government secrecy project. “The idea that the scale of the US military presence in a war zone should be kept secret from the public is a mistake. That’s not how democracies fight or win wars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2c41fb8b2931da1a4d07f9becdbfa832a498ee/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=80a6e9f9b53edb460899b317dcb53716","title":"coronavirus what is eu medical equipment scheme why did uk opt out","story":"British government is facing criticism for not taking part in joint purchase of supplies amid the coronavirus pandemicThe British government is coming under fire for failing to join the EU’s procurement scheme for medical equipment, including masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, testing kits and ventilators, at a time when NHS health workers across the country are crying out for more supplies. In the latest twist, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was forced to deny claims, later retracted, by the government’s senior diplomat that it had been a “political decision” to opt out of the scheme.The British government signed the EU’s joint procurement agreement in 2014 after the H1N1 pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in the access and purchasing power of EU countries to obtain pandemic vaccines and medicines.Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government has the right to take part until 31 December 2020. The purpose of the scheme is to allow participants to act together as a big block purchaser, securing the best prices and forcing the way to the front of the queue at a time of shortage.Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has launched four calls for tender for medical equipment and supplies. It invited companies to supply gloves and surgical gowns on 28 February, personal protective equipment (PPE) for eye and respiratory protection on 15 March and medical ventilators and respiratory equipment on the same day. A final call to companies to supply laboratory equipment, including testing kits, was made on 19 March. The total value of PPE being purchased is about €1.5bn (£1.3bn). The EU ceiling for purchases of ventilators is €790m. The first call for tender of PPE on 28 February failed because of a lack of suitable suppliers. It was relaunched on 12 March. Since then all four calls for tender have successfully found companies willing to supply the goods to the scale and quality required. The timeline for delivery varies. Some of the PPE is expected imminently. There is a longer time-frame for deliveries of ventilators with the EU warning member states that it could take as long as a year for the all the machines to arrive.When it emerged last month that the UK was not involved in the EU’s bulk purchase of ventilators despite being aware of its existence and purpose, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK had not joined as the country was “not in the EU”. That line changed within 24 hours and a communications error was blamed. An email from the European commission inviting the UK to join had been sent to an out-of-date and defunct address. When the  reported last week that there had been multiple opportunities to be involved with the purchase of PPE, as well as ventilators, further details had emerged of the communications error. The UK, it was said, had only received an invitation to sit on the the EU’s joint procurement agreement steering group on the 19 March. By then all four of the procurements had been organised.The Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, flatly contradicted the explanation of the UK’s opt-out during an appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee. “It was a political decision,” McDonald said. “The UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.” The comments raised concerns that Brexit ideology had been put before the practicalities of saving lives.Within an hour, Hancock denied the decision had been politically motivated”. Shortly afterwards, McDonald issued a formal correction in a letter to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. “Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate,” McDonald wrote.Hancock and Helen Whately, the care minister, pointed out on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning that the EU’s scheme has yet to deliver any medical supplies. It has also been suggested by anonymous government officials to various media outlets that the UK is now part of a procurement of therapeutics and products required for vaccines.In reality, no such new procurements have yet been launched. As for the ongoing procurements, eight suppliers have offered PPE products in excess of that being ordered by the participating member states, and deliveries are expected to European healthcare workers shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ba617eab86ca600abea84974ac153f912fb1cff/154_0_2691_1615/master/2691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23329b2bcaa46aba44713276298f8a0f","title":"delayed plane carrying ppe from turkey lands in uk coronavirus","story":"Helen Whately says shipment is being checked, but fails to explain why offers from British suppliers were ignoredA health minister has confirmed the delayed Turkish shipment of personal protective equipment (PPE) has landed in the UK but struggled to explain why so many offers of gowns, masks and other items from British suppliers have been ignored.Helen Whately, the care minister, said at least part of the consignment arrived on Wednesday morning on an RAF flight and was being checked, after an unexplained four-day hold up. This included a supply of protective gowns, but it is thought unlikely that all 400,000 gowns the health service is seeking for frontline staff have arrived in the UK, where the NHS is using the 150,000 gowns a day.The plane had been dispatched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two other aircraft have been on standby to pick up further supplies from Turkey since late on 20 April.The Department of Health and Social Care was blamed for failing to secure the necessary export approvals from Turkey after placing the order, but health sources said on 22 April that there were other reasons for the delay.The supplier had contacted the NHS on 16 April to say it could make the 400,000 gowns, and the UK placed an order on 17 April, paying a deposit to secure delivery. But almost immediately it was told there was an unexpected manufacturing delay.Originally three RAF transport planes had been on standby to pick up the equipment, but in desperation a single plane was sent to Istanbul on 20 April to pick up whatever was available, finally heading back the following night.The planes remain on standby at RAF Brize Norton and may fly to Istanbul imminently if there is enough equipment waiting to make the journey worthwhile. “We’ve been told there is another delivery at the airport now, but we are not yet sure if there’s enough to justify a flight,” a defence source said.Turkish sources said they had done everything they could to expedite the shipment, but said Britain had not asked for export approval until 19 and 20 April. Like many other countries, Turkey has placed controls on the export of medical equipment in the light of the coronavirus crisis.  Meanwhile, in a round of broadcast interviews, Whately failed to explain why offers of PPE sitting in British warehouses were being ignored in many cases, including 16m face masks identified by the .She said 3,000 out of 8,000 offers had received a substantive response but the government was prioritising those with bulk supply.However, she had no answer to why offers of immediate kit sitting in UK stockpiles were not being taken up.Pressed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said the main reason was a greater focus on “those who have an established supply chain”, even though the government was grateful for all offers.Despite pleas from NHS leaders for politicians not to talk about kit that has not yet been delivered, Whately said the government was “expecting millions of face masks coming from China” this week.The government has come in for mounting criticism over its failure to ensure NHS staff treating coronavirus patients have the protective equipment they need.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Ministers insisted they were pursuing “every possible option” to secure additional kit but said that, with unprecedented worldwide demand, the situation was “very challenging”.Separately, the government said 140,000 gowns had arrived from Myanmar, but with the NHS using 150,000 a day, the demand on resources remains intense.With fears that staff in hospitals and care homes are risking their lives, the TUC called for an independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the issue to be mounted before the end of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddac790ae769d992a1212ced7dcf3a6dd3610da1/0_258_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb2004fc15d904fae7eab11de5a27d3c","title":"europe had hottest year on record in 2019 new report shows","story":"Findings confirm 11 of the 12 warmest years in Europe occurred in past two decadesEurope had its hottest year on record last year, new data has confirmed, with periods of exceptional heat last February, June and July, and one of the wettest Novembers on record.Previous records were broken by only a small margin, but the findings confirmed that 11 out of the 12 warmest years in Europe have occurred in the past two decades, according to the European State of the Climate 2019 report, published on Wednesday.There was drought in central Europe over the summer, but at the end of 2019 four times the normal amount of rain fell in western and southern Europe.A heatwave in Greenland last year brought record levels of surface melting, the report found, though the European Arctic was slightly colder across the year than in some other recent years, with the lowest average since 2010. Europe’s glaciers have lost an average of 16 tonnes of fresh water per square metre since 1997.Summer temperatures in parts of Europe were as much as 3C to 4C higher than normal in 2019, the report said, with heatwaves in June and July breaking records in France and Germany.The data confirms other findings that show a clearly warming trend globally. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also produced its final report for 2019, confirming that last year was globally the second hottest on record, with the oceans reaching the highest temperatures ever recorded.Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.But the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.Among the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.On Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO, said that although the coronavirus crisis would probably result in a temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions, it would also make it harder to help people afflicted by the impact of climate breakdown. He warned that ignoring the climate crisis would have a greater impact than the pandemic.“Whilst Covid-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human wellbeing, ecosystems and economies for centuries,” he said. “We need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves. We need to show the same determination and unity against climate change as against Covid-19. We need to act together in the interests of the health and welfare of humanity, not just for the coming weeks and months but for many generations ahead.”Globally, the past five-year mean temperatures were 1.1C above pre-industrial levels, taking the world closer to the 2C threshold, beyond which scientists say climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. All countries are bound by the Paris agreement to hold global heating rises to no more than 2C, though the US is withdrawing from the accord.Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which compiled the European State of the Climate 2019 report, on behalf of the European Commission, said: “One exceptional warm year does not constitute a warming trend, but with detailed information from our operational services, that covers many different aspects of our climate, we are able to connect the dots to learn more about how it is changing.” The reports were published to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which is being celebrated online around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a698d19b6dfe4944c38aa3bb4878907069d959/0_17_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71189b8b7e135cc2b798b710d9de7f64","title":"eu turns up pressure on matt hancock over covid 19 ppe scheme","story":"Brussels says UK was briefed on bulk-buying plan and given ‘ample opportunity’ to joinThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, is facing fresh pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given “ample opportunity” to join an EU scheme bulk-buying masks, gowns, gloves and goggles.After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK’s lack of involvement in the EU’s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a “political decision” to opt out.The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and personal protective equipment.UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because “owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time”.The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: “The EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings.“The UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.”On Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, speaking in the Commons, announced that 69 people working within the NHS had died from the coronavirus. There are growing fears about the shortages of personal protective equipment within the healthcare system.Raab confirmed, in response to questions from the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that the government needed to “strive even harder in this incredibly difficult and competitive international environment” to source protective equipment.As the  has previously revealed, UK health officials attended meetings on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March, where joint procurement rounds for protective gear, ventilators and medical supplies were discussed.On Tuesday, the health secretary was forced to deny claims, since retracted, by the UK’s most senior diplomat, Sir Simon McDonald, that ministers had made a “political decision” in not getting involved.Speaking at Downing Street’s daily press briefing on Tuesday evening, Hancock said: “I have spoken to the foreign secretary. As far as I’m aware there was no political decision not to participate.“We did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.”A spokesman for the European commission rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU’s efforts to buy masks, gowns, ventilators or laboratory supplies. “They are most welcome to participate in future rounds,” the spokesman said.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first.

It’s a time we strengthen the bond.”The virus has emptied Islam’s holiest sites at the most sacred time of year. The Ka’bah, the gold-embroidered shrine in Mecca’s Grand Mosque, is closed to worshippers along with the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina and Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque.“Our hearts are tortured from pain in the holy month of Ramadan,” said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswami, the imam and director of al-Aqsa, where only guards and mosque employees will be permitted to pray. “It is a very sad moment in the history of Islam.”Jamia Masjid, one of the oldest and grandest mosques in the disputed south Asian territory of Kashmir, usually overflows in the evenings with people gathering for prayer and discussing religion, politics and life. This month it will sit silent for the first time in living memory.“In Ramadan I would pray all five times of the day at Jamia and would also do iftar there, but this time it is a matter of life and death,” said Fatima, 74, from Srinagar. “There is danger outside and the best thing is to stay home, stay quiet.”Indonesia has banned mudik, an annual homecoming in which tens of millions of people travel to see their families for Eid-al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the fasting month.Across Israel and Palestine, mosques – as well as churches and synagogues – have been closed. Abdullah Abu Galous, a 38-year-old hardware shop owner from the Palestinian city of Ramallah, said it felt as if Ramadan had been cancelled.“I would never have thought that a tiny virus could stop us from celebrating the month of Ramadan. It has held more than one billion Muslims throughout the world hostage,” he said.Authorities in Turkey have so far resisted calls for a total lockdown, insisting the wheels of the economy must keep turning. But Ramadan will be marked by a new four-day lockdown starting from Thursday night, during which families will not be able to travel to eat and celebrate together without risking fines or arrest.The emergency has raised unprecedented issues for many of the religion’s 1.8 billion adherents as they prepare to abstain from food and water during sunlight hours.Several Arab newspapers have carried expert assurances that fasting has not been shown to reduce resistance to the virus. Al-Azhar, Egypt’s top Sunni mosque, said last week that coronavirus could not be used as an excuse not to participate unless it was scientifically established that drinking water helps to ward off the disease.Lockdowns have curtailed the production schedules of some of the soap operas that are a staple of Ramadan evenings in many homes, leaving TV executives scrambling to fill airtime during their most lucrative advertising season.But the inability to pray and eat together may be most keenly felt. In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain has encouraged people to hold virtual iftars on social media.More than 1,400 people have signed up for nightly iftar broadcast of the call to prayer, and guest speakers are being organised over Zoom by the UK-based Ramadan Tent Project, with the option for viewers to split off into smaller group discussions. “Just because you’re in quarantine, it doesn’t mean you have to spend Ramadan alone,” said Rohma Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the project.Abu Ibrahim, 32, said he was keeping this year’s difficulties in perspective. In 2011 he observed Ramadan under airstrikes in Dara’a, southern Syria. The following year he spent the first day of the month dodging Syrian army patrols to escape on foot to Jordan.“People say, how are we going to get through this Ramadan when we can’t see each other, when there’s a health risk,” he said. “We used to put food on the table and hear the sound of bombing. We were scared of death, of our families dying. Coronavirus doesn’t worry me. I’m in my house, with my family, we’re safe, we have electricity, phones, food.”Fa’ek Thyabat, the imam of Bab Al-Rayan mosque in Amman, said the Qu’ran did not explicitly guide worshippers on how to observe Ramadan during a plague, leaving worshippers to navigate the uncharted territory with reference to the wider tradition.“Similarly, if we know that Muslims who eat garlic and onion are advised not to go to mosques because the bad breath will hurt mosquegoers, it is easy to conclude that you cannot go to the mosque when there is the risk of spreading contagious disease.”In a faith without formal hierarchies, not all Islamic leaders share Thyabat’s interpretation. Hundreds of worshippers continue to turn out for prayers in Herat, Afghanistan, where a hardline preacher, Mujib Rahman Ansari, recently advised his followers that death from coronavirus was a form of martyrdom.In neighbouring Pakistan, the government has compromised with clerics by lifting a ban on group prayers during Ramadan on condition that no carpet is laid, children and older people stay away and worshippers wear masks and keep six feet apart.Maulvi Haider Zaman, a prayer leader in Islamabad, said coronavirus was “not an issue” and insisted it was important people still came to offer prayers during Ramadan.“People are not afraid to perform their prayers,” he said. “We will be imposing social distancing in the mosque but I don’t think it is needed as coronavirus will not affect people in mosques. It’s the home of Allah.” In Jordan, Thyabat said he was instructing worshippers to focus on the upsides. Ramadan in past years had been an occasion for increasingly lavish iftar feasts and shopping bonanzas, he said. “This Ramadan is an opportunity for people to re-adopt the real spirit of fasting, which is about austerity and helping relatives and needy people.”Additional reporting by Sufian Taha, Jassar Al-Tahat, Shah Meer Baloch, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii and a reporter in Srinagar"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0339f3ac7716020b8d134d2da10562f8883867da/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dc4ef5a4aaace2943b04aadf674e203","title":"revealed private firm running uk ppe stockpile was sold in middle of pandemic","story":"Movianto was also involved in legal disputes with firm that built warehouse to store equipmentThe warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.For security reasons, the  has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK’s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic–size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.However, the  can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (£107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to “lock the gates” and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.Morley’s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was “a much bigger story that needs to be told” about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley’s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.“Movianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,” the firm said.But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government’s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German–owned multinational to an American one.In the coming months the custody of the UK’s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: “The pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.”Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government’s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been “one of distribution rather than one of supply”. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated £500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature–controlled conditions.The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens \u0026amp Minor, won the £55m deal in the summer of 2018.As part of Movianto’s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.Movianto’s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was “made by executives no longer associated with Movianto”.A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain “a ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event”.In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley’s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became “uncooperative”. “This went on for weeks,” he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent “in accordance with the terms of the lease”.Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which “kept going on the blink” resulting, he alleges, in “temperature spikes”.A Movianto source said Morley’s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of “Morley’s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations”.By his own account, Morley’s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. “It got to the point where I said I’m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.” When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.Movianto said the injunction was required as “a result of Morley’s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto’s operations”. It said Morley’s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by “various court proceedings” that ruled in Movianto’s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley’s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto – and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank’s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a £75m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the “borrowed personal wealth” to spend on “South African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet”.Morley told the  his lifestyle was the result of hard work and “had nothing to do with being a good landlord”. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm “failed to comply” with the conditions of a £61m loan facility.Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator’s report, the legal dispute “caused delays to the construction works” at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes “have had no impact on Movianto’s work in response to Covid-19”.According to a government source, the transfer of the UK’s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for £45m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.In the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens \u0026amp Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK’s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.The distribution of that stockpile’s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new “247 military operation” to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,” Hancock said.A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic – the basis of Movianto’s original contract. Movianto was now “supporting” the government’s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were “confidential”.Jeff Jochims, the chief operating officer of Owens \u0026amp Minor, said: “We look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH, but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbe1f950ed12fee89173fe1355a297e53a150388/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4378e22740e47c17d9100470a34de9a","title":"see how coronavirus can spread through a population and how countries flatten the curve","story":"One important characteristic of viruses and other pathogens is how contagious they are.This is measured in a few ways. One key measure is the R0, or basic reproduction number, which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates.For an R0 of three we would expect each new case of a disease to produce three other infections.This is not just a measure of the inherent infectiousness of a disease. It also depends on other factors, including the rate of contact within a population and the duration of the infectious period. It\u0027s a situation-dependent value, so in one city the R0 might be higher and in another lower. It also assumes that the entire population is susceptible to the disease.So what does that look like, and how does it compare with other diseases?How does Covid-19 compare with other diseases?Here, you can see the same spread patterns generated based on the R0 for a range of pathogens in a range of situations, ranging from Spanish flu to the highly contagious measles, for which R0 has been estimated to range between 12 and 18.But the R0 is not the only important number. The effective reproduction number, R, is a value that takes into account the susceptibility of the population.Here, you can set the thresholds for different values and see the result using our simplified model. The reality of pandemics is far more complex but this does demonstrate the basic concepts underlying the spread of diseases.

That 24-hours-a-day detention excludes exercise or use of telephone or shower. The amendments also lift the requirement to provide nutritious food and drink to meet religious needs or to provide clean socks and underwear daily and clean clothes as often as is necessary.We are particularly concerned that the guidance to governors does not include the statement that these changes should only be applied in extreme circumstances.The pair also raised issues around oversight and scrutiny, as well inconsistent practise around different prisons. There are already serious concerns about prisoners’ well-being after family visits were suspended and exercise and other activities severely restricted because of social distancing.

Dominic Raab said he did not agree, saying people would expect the government to be focusing now on handling the crisis. Raab told MPs:I have to say I won’t take up his offer of committing to a public inquiry.I think that there are definitely lessons to be learned and when we get through this crisis it will be important that we take stock and we come together to understand with an unprecedented challenge on an international scale what can be done to avoid it happening again.But I think right now, from our key NHS frontline workers to the members of the public, they would rightly expect our full focus to be, as we come through the peak of this virus, to make sure that we save lives, protect the NHS and steer the whole country through this crisis rather than engaging in that process or that set of deliberations right now.In a post-PMQs briefing, Keir Starmer’s spokesman also said the time was not right for an inquiry. The spokesman said:Keir has said that he believes serious mistakes have been made in the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and ministers do need to be held accountable for those mistakes. The priority now has got to be on how the government fixes the current mistakes it is making.Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor, said he expects it will take several years for the UK economy to recover from the pandemic – and even then it won’t “bounce back” to where it was. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One today: I think we are going to find it a huge blow to the GDP during the crisis and we won’t just bounce back. Of course there will be a recovery, but I fear it won’t bounce back to where we were.My own expectation is once we come out of lockdown, probably for the next two to three years, we will be struggling constantly with the effort to get economies back to something like the healthy state we would have liked to have seen them in before we started.Demand will be suppressed by the considerable number of unemployed we will have, the considerable number of businesses that will be seriously damaged and the whole economy will be held back by the as yet unknown colossal burden of debt.Labour’s Maria Eagle asks if there is a link between Liverpool having a higher than average incidence of coronavirus and the government’s decision to allow the Liverpool v Atlético Madrid match to go ahead on 11 March. The government’s deputy chief scientific adviser has said there might be a link. Does the government think there is a connection?Hancock says that is a question for the scientists.And that’s the end of the Hancock statement.The UK has signed an agreement with Greece to clamp down on migrant crossings in the east Mediterranean, the Home Office has announced.A significant proportion of undocumented migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa who seek to reach the UK first pass through Greece on their journey across Europe.The Home Office said the joint action plan, signed by the UK and Greek governments, is designed to tighten asylum and returns processes, enhance work to dismantle migrant smuggling networks and renews the deployment of a Border Force cutter, a patrol vessel that picks up migrants in the Mediterranean.Chris Philp, the minister for immigration compliance, said: Illegal migration is facilitated by dangerous, malicious, criminals, taking advantage of the desperate situations that many people find themselves in. They do not care about the safety of the people involved.The joint action plan will deliver on our commitment to keep our borders secure and will discourage those considering making the dangerous and illegal journey into Greece, through Europe, and in many cases to the UK.This is from the Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-KhanShe has repeatedly urged the UK government to bring its advice in line with that of the World Health Organization, which recommends self-isolation for 14 days as you can still spread the virus after the symptoms have resolved.Labour’s Barry Sheerman, appearing via Zoom, tells Hancock that the “management and leadership of this present crisis has been shambolic”. He says the UK has lagged behind Germany and that a death toll of around 800 people (the daily figure at certain points) is equivalent to two jumbo jets crashing. I believe it is a shambles of leadership and management. I believe we are letting down NHS staff, and they have been let down.He also claims that NHS whistleblowers have been leant on not to tell the truth about conditions in the NHS. He goes on:Hancock says Sheerman had misjudged his tone, and missed what the government was doing. The prime goals were to flatten the curve, and to ensure the NHS was not overwhelmed.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Irish universities have performed strongly in a new global ranking which measures their social and economic impact.The Times Higher Education on Wednesday published its “2020 impact rankings” which seeks to measure the social and economic impact of universities under the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was ranked number one in the world under the inidual category of “good health and wellbeing” .When measured against all 17 UN goals, it ranked between 101 and 200 universities out of almost 800 participating institutions.Overall, Trinity was the highest ranked Irish university in 14th place across all 17 goals, up from 28th last year.UCC was the next highest placed (32nd), followed by UCD (34th), NUI Galway (68th) and DCU (84th).UL, Maynooth University and RCSI all ranked between 101 and 200, while TU Dublin ranked between 401 and 600.The strong performance of Irish universities contrasts with the overall world university rankings, which measure factors such as funding, staff-student ratios and research capacity.Funding crisisOur top universities have been sliding down those league tables in recent years due to what college presidents say is a funding crisis, linked to declining State funding per student over the past decade.The sector has warned that a major decline in international student numbers means Irish universities face a deeper financial black hole over the coming years.Irish universities, meanwhile, warmly received the latest impact rankings as a sign of their positive contribution to society.The RCSI - now officially known as the RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences - said it was delighted with its top ranking in health.Prof Cathal Kelly, RCSI chief executive, said it recognised the work of staff and students to improve health and wellbeing in the community at home and abroad.“As our staff and students face the challenges of working and training in support of the health service during the Covid-19 pandemic, today’s recognition of our contribution to health and wellbeing is particularly meaningful for the RCSI community at this critical time for global health,” he said.“Their contributions as expert health advisors, clinicians and volunteers on the frontline, and continued dedication to their studies in health sciences in challenging circumstances, exemplifies our commitment to health and wellbeing,” he said.Trinity’s dean of research, Professor Linda Doyle, said it was proud to rank so highly in making positive social and economic impacts.Sustainability“It underscores our continued commitment - across all areas of the University - to sustainability and equality of opportunity and underlines the impact we are having in making the planet a better place,” she said.UCC President Prof Patrick O’Shea said and the UN’s sustainable development goals “form the framework for the innovations needed to reboot and retool our economy for long-term success and resilience.”NUI Galway president Prof Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh said it was “heartening to see Irish universities taking such a lead role in addressing” these goals, which were arguably the most important targets for the world to meet.DCU president Prof Brian MacCraith said its high placing was a “ testament to the hard work and dedication of our staff and students and their commitment to our mission and values”.Australasian universities have dominated the overall rankings, securing the top four spots.The University of Auckland was ranked in first place followed by Australia’s University of Sydney, Western Sydney University, and La Trobe University.The rest of the top 10 is made up of the Arizona State University (Tempe) , University of Bologna, Canada’s University of British Columbia, University of Manchester, King’s College London and Australia’s RMIT University."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4234591.1587505252!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert likely to get under way on july 29th minister says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh says the Leaving Cert is likely to get under way on Wednesday, July 29th. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA Wire The Leaving Cert exams are likely to get under way on Wednesday, July 29th, the Minister for Education Joe McHugh has said.In a live Instagram interview with the youth website Spunout.ie, Mr McHugh said he hoped to be in a position to formally announced the date in consultation with education partners soon.However, he said he was keen for exams to begin on a Wednesday so students do not face five days of exams in their first week.A more detailed timetable will not be finalised until early June, he said, as officials want to have the most up-to-date advice available before making decisions.For example, he said at present the maximum time a small group can spend in a room together is two hours, which would impact on the timing of exams.Plan AMr McHugh also said holding the Leaving Cert in late July is Department of Education’s “plan A” and all efforts will go towards making this happen.He acknowledged, however, this was based on the assumption that the public will continue to abide by public health restrictions and that the Covid-19 curve is flattened further,“Yes, we could face enormous challenges that we’re not in a position to make predictions about.”He said his department had looked at the option of using predicted grades, but ruled it out at there was “too much inherent bias” in the system and they would not be fair.“There’s the practicality of teachers’ grading nieces, nephews, sons or daughters, or teachers who are easy markers or hard markers... we don’t feel the policy of predicted grading is a fair system,” he said.The Minister also said there is no standardised system of continuous assessment in Ireland. Predicted gradesOn the question of whether students could have been given predicted grades, along with the option of sitting exams in autumn, Mr McHugh said this would have introduce two options and a “big, big decision” had to be made,In relation to the digital ide and students losing out, he said he hoped to be in a position to make an announcement on this shortly.He said his department has been in talks with the Department of Communications over access to mobile data for students who do not have broadband."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4234379.1587487206!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ten pupils per class hourly handwashing what reopened schools could look like","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrimary school children sit at desks spaced about two yards apart, in Logumkloster, Denmark. Photograph: Emile DuckeThe New York TimesTo get a sense of what Irish classrooms might look like when they eventually reopen, Tingjerg primary school in Denmark offers a glimpse into the future.Like many other primary schools in the country, it opened for the first time last week after a month in lockdown.It is operating under strict rules aimed at limiting the risk of infections among children.In classrooms, each desk is at least 2m apart. A maximum of 10 children is permitted in each class. All school rooms – such as the sports hall – are being used as teaching areas. Children can only play with a limited number of others during breaktime. Sharing of lunch is not allowed. There is handwashing every hour or so. And the drop-off and collection of children takes place at intervals.Marco Damgaard, the school principal, says public health experts, parents, teachers and educators helped review and prepare the reopening plan.“It’s an absolute quality stamp,” he said. “There are a lot of questions from parents and employees who need to be answered and that is only quite understandable... Clear and constructive communication between adults is crucial to the well-being, safety and learning of children.”In Ireland, officials are drawing up a pathway for the potential reopening of schools subject to public health advice.Current restrictions apply until May 5th. Well-placed sources say it is highly unlikely schools will reopen then, but the likelihood of primary schools reopening in June should become clearer.Internet accessMinister for Health Simon Harris said at the weekend his personal preference was for primary schools to reopen for up to one day a week before the end of the academic year.Principals and teachers have all signalled that they are ready to assist with school opening in line with the guidance of public health advice.Páiric Clerkin of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network says an easing of the restrictions to facilitate safe access by school staff in the short term should be considered first.This, he says, would ensure that critical leadership and management responsibilities can be fulfilled.“This would help those for whom access to the internet at home has been problematic and school leaders and administrators who need direct access to school systems and physical documents to comply with legal obligations such as forms that must be returned to the Department of Education by the end of April, as well as recruitment-related matters,” he says.John Boyle, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation, says school reopening is feasible – subject to public health advice – but warns there will be major challenges.Small rural schools, he says, have issues with transport and trying to accommodate four or five classes in the one classroom.Class sizesAverage class sizes at primary level in Ireland have about 25 pupils but can be much higher. This compares to average class sizes of about 19 in Denmark.“We would want to work with whatever advice is forthcoming, we’d want to plan it out appropriately, if a school opened for the morning for half the class, that half would go home rather than go to the playground and then the next half would come in after there would be a deep clean of the school,” he said.Secondary schools – which finish up at the end of May – look set to remain shut, apart from a two-week period in July for Leaving Cert students preparing for exams.During these two weeks, classes will be split and take place subject to social-distancing rules. This may prove to be a template for how schools resume in September.Clive Byrne of the National Principals and Deputy Principals Association says schools will have to rethink issues such as integral aspects of school such as transport, school matches, assemblies.“Our schools are designed to accommodate classes of up to 30 or so children, they aren’t designed for social distancing,” he says.“So, will we be able to have 20-plus children in a room? Or will we need to split up the class and have some taught remotely in another room? These are all matters we’re going to have to discuss.”Prof Sam McConkey of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and a specialist in infectious diseases, says public health authorities will likely be guided by whether we make good progress in meeting a list of six criteria set by the World Health Organisation before opening schools.These criteria include co-operation with public health measures, testing capacity and measures to help prevent re-infection.“We’re making good progress on some of those, but we have a lot to do on others,” he says.The good news, he says, is that the latest indications from data collected in Iceland and elsewhere are that children are not “super-spreaders”.“Children aren’t the problem,” he says. “They have significantly lower infection rates. So, reopening schools should be completely doable.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233580.1587407409!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china based corkman in the right place at the right time for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Paul O’Brien used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland. Photograph: Angela Ponce  BloombergWhen the Green Jersey awards are being handed out for service during the national pandemic there is sure to be one with the name of Dr Paul O’Brien on it.A China-based doctor and regulatory expert, Dr O’Brien could be said to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Covid-19 outbreak started in that country at the beginning of the year. However, the 35-year-old Corkman proved to be the right man in the right place for Ireland when the disease started heading to Europe and he realised he could play a major role in our efforts to deal with the crisis. He first came to public attention when he wrote an open letter online to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and HSE boss Paul Reid in early March critiquing aspects of the national response to the pandemic. Based on his conversations with Chinese medics, he believed – correctly – that Europe was at the time sleepwalking itself into a crisis.“I was very worried because I had been in touch with Chinese docs and they said we seemed not to know what we’re in for.”But whereas others might have preferred to hurl on the ditch, O’Brien, eschewing an overtly political approach, has been of enormous practical assistance in sourcing help from China to bring to bear on the emerging crisis back at home.When the disease was still confined to China, he had been involved in trying to source personal protective equipment for local doctors from Europe. Now, he used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland.Cork rootsFrom Montenotte, he got in touch with fellow Corkmen, GP Nick Flynn and respiratory consultant Oisin O’Connell. A WhatsApp group was set up which has become a lively forum for sourcing equipment and exchanging ideas on how best to address problem areas as the pandemic approached. Many of the supply issues for PPE and ventilators were solved through contacts on this group.O’Brien organised teleconferences in which Chinese doctors from Wuhan shared their expertise in fighting coronavirus. Another Corkman, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, was brought in to lend “gravitas” and help nail deals for the supply of equipment.He also translated a 146-page protocol used in a Chinese hospital so it could advise Irish hospitals on how best to treat patients with the virus.Meanwhile, O’Brien’s own life is on hold. Having studied genetics and food science, he had gone to China to train as a doctor at Zhejiang University. He is now married to a local woman and they have a young child. He had been due to travel to the US to do his final exams for practising medicine there but this was scuppered by the pandemic. And while he has applied to Ireland On Call, his Chinese qualifications are unlikely to be recognised quickly enough back at home.He is, however, optimistic that Ireland will succeed in curbing the advance of the virus and that a vaccine will be developed more quickly than many people expect.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireRestrictions introduced to deal with Covid-19 may be eased in stages every two to three weeks if efforts to tackle the virus are successful, under plans being considered by the Government.However, well-placed sources said any easing of restrictions at the end of the current period of the lockdown on May 5th would be very limited.Ministers and officials are working on a plan to ease restrictions but there is anxiety within the Government about acting too hastily and then having to reintroduce strict measures.The first phase of restrictions to be lifted will be “very, very limited” said one source, who added that even returning to the measures that were in place before an effective lockdown was introduced on April 12th may be “too drastic”.Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time on Tuesday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government would outline its plan before May 5th and it would be considered by Cabinet by the end of April. He said he hoped to ease restrictions after May 5th but did not want to give false assurances.He said the plan would lay out “in different steps” how the economy and society would be reopened. “I think everyone understands it won’t be done in one go, in one fell swoop,” he said.In advance of any such move, the Government on Tuesday announced it was extending a ban on mass licensed gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of August, giving event organisers notice that concerts and other festivals were off for the summer.Although the move did not strictly apply to sports gatherings, numerous Ministers said events such as the All-Ireland football and hurling series would not take place this summer.“It will become quite clear that they can’t go ahead,” said one Minister.On the back of the announcement, the Galway Races announced its public meetings would not go ahead, while the Football Association of Ireland sought clarity from the Government on soccer fixtures.RecoveryThe National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday night said that more than 9,000 people in Ireland who tested positive for Covid-19 had successfully recovered from the disease.The deaths of another 44 patients – 18 males and 26 females – diagnosed with Covid-19 had been reported on Tuesday by NPHET.There have now been 730 Covid-19 related deaths confirmed by laboratory tests in the Republic. However, a further 108 probable or suspected deaths in care settings was reported by NPHET on Tuesday. NPHET also reported 388 new confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 16,040.It is understood that an option being considered by the Government is an easing of restrictions every two to three weeks after a possible initial easing off from May 5th. This would allow for an assessment of how any changes were affecting the spread of the virus.Some easing of cocooning measures for the over-70s, as well as the re-opening of DIY stores, are seen as the likeliest options for the first wave, as well as clarity on how schools could partially reopen. People may also be allowed travel further to exercise, it was suggested.Minister for Education Joe McHugh on Tuesday night said the Leaving Certificate could start on July 29th.Ministers attending Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting said there was general anxiety about moving too quickly and having to re-introduce restrictions, as well as worry about a potential second wave of Covid-19.Although a gradual easing every two to three weeks was seen as desirable, one senior source said it was highly likely that people would be told at some point over the summer that a hoped-for lifting of restrictions would not go ahead because of insufficient progress in tackling the virus.The majority of Ministers at Cabinet on Tuesday were said to be in favour of a cautious approach.As discussion continues on North-South co-operation, Mike Tomlinson, emeritus professor of social policy at Queen’s University Belfast writes in Wednesday’s : “It is reasonable to assume that the North’s higher death rates result from lower rates of testing, the lack of contact tracing and the slower application of lockdown measures compared with the Republic. “The evidence underlines the case for co-ordinated action across the island to hunt down the virus through high levels of testing and contact tracing and for stronger public-health surveillance at points of entry.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4234994.1587548353!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus payments likely to be tapered after 12 weeks donohoe says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe briefs the media on the latest measures being taken in response to Covid-19. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA Wire. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said the Covid-19 support payments would likely be “tapered” and “changed” when the 12 week period is up. The Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme, which started on March 26th, allows employers to continue to pay their employees during the crisis. It is set to end on May 7th. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment of €350 a week applies to people aged between 18 and 66 who have lost their jobs due to the crisis. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland on Wednesday, Mr Donohoe said:“I think it’s very likely when I get to that 12 week period I will be tapering and changing it. But the nature of that decision will depend on where we are with the economy and where we are with Covid-19.“Many of the measures that we have in place at the moment from an economic point of view - we cannot sustain them indefinitely, but we will be able to sustain them for long enough to allow incomes to continue to be protected where possible and to give over 40,000 companies that are currently in our income subsidy scheme a fighting chance of returning to economic and business health.”The country is facing “considerable economic challenges,” but he and the Taoiseach want to avoid cuts to social welfare rates.The Minister predicted that peak unemployment will reduce to 14 per cent by the end of the year. “As we go into next year it should drop further.”Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Donohoe said the coronavirus crisis had resulted in a “severe recession” with unemployment soaring to a record 22 per cent – an economic shock without precedent in modern times.Mr Donohoe said his department was predicting unemployment to hit 22 per cent in the second quarter, “the highest level on record”, before easing back thereafter.The overall fiscal cost of the virus in exchequer terms would also be significant with the Government now expecting to run a deficit of 7.5 per cent or €23 billion this year, instead of a surplus of €2.2 billion, which had been forecast at the start of the year. This corresponds to a €25 billion reversal in the public finances.Easing restrictionsThe deaths of another 44 patients – 18 males and 26 females – diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported on Tuesday by NPHET.There have now been 730 Covid-19 related deaths confirmed by laboratory tests in the Republic. However, a further 108 probable or suspected deaths in care settings was reported by NPHET on Tuesday.NPHET also reported 388 new confirmed cases.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

They hope this decoy will provoke the body to generate antibodies it would need to destroy the real thing.But although the two projects have similar aims, their methods of provoking this antibody response are quite different. At Oxford, Prof Gilbert\u0027s team is effectively trying to adapt a different virus, taken from chimpanzees, to do the job. At Imperial, Prof Shattock\u0027s team plans to inject a harmless genetic recipe from Sars-Cov-2 into the body so that the body itself generates the spike proteins. We are essentially using nucleic acid, RNA, to deliver the code for the surface protein of the virus, and so we deliver that in, essentially, a liquid droplet, Prof Shattock told the BBC. The Oxford group are doing something similar, but are using a viral particle to deliver their genetic code to the cells following injection.That viral particle – chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford 1, or ChAdOx1 – has already been studied as a potential vaccine delivery mechanism against another coronavirus, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers), which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Now it has been repurposed as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.A clinical trial will begin in the UK on Thursday to test its efficacy. In the test, 510 healthy adults between the ages of 18-55 will be split into five different groups and participate in the study for approximately six months, with the option to to have an extra follow-up visit after 12 months, in May 2021.Two groups will receive a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, containing 50 billion so-called viral particles. Two other control groups will instead receive a single dose of the MenACWY vaccine, which protects against four strains of the meningococcal bacteria – A, C, W and Y. None will know what they have been given.The fifth group, meanwhile, will be given two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one at the beginning of the trial and one after four weeks. The trial has two very simple aims – does the vaccine work, and is it safe? – and will accordingly test for cases of Covd-19 after six months as well as monitoring so-called serious adverse events, or SAEs.The Imperial study will not begin until June. But according to Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, who this week announced £22.5 million of funding for Imperial and £20 million for Oxford, Government money would support clinical trials to assess a sample of several thousand, and for that to be followed by an even larger trial. Getting to such human trials now has been the fruit of dramatically accelerated work given vaccines usually take up to 18 months to develop. The following info graphic shows the usual routes to treatments and the timescales involved.Chinese scientists unravelled the genetic code of Sars-Cov-2 within weeks of the first cases. By early February, Prof Shattock\u0027s team had taken this code and folded the instructions for the spike protein into a genetic molecule called a plasmid, which can replicate itself.This self-replicating recipe was injected into mice to see if it was safe, and the success of such animal tests has allowed the team to progress to the forthcoming human trials.Prof Shattock said it was an advantage to have two teams working on  different methods. Why it\u0027s good to have both approaches is that there are many risks of failure along the way, he added. So by having two approaches, we increase the chances of having an effective vaccine in the UK. And both these approaches could have complementary activity and so they could eventually be combined if we need to have a prime and boost to make an even more effective vaccine for certain populations.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/22/TELEMMGLPICT000229957589_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"missouri sues china handling coronavirus pandemic","story":"A woman holds a sign as she attends a rally outside the Missouri Capitol to protest stay-at-home orders put into place due to the Covid-19 outbreakThe state of Missouri filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic.The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top lawyer, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.”Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt in a written statement said the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and didn’t do enough to slow its spread.“The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of Covid-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” he said.They must be held accountable for their actions.”It’s unclear whether the lawsuit will have much, if any, impact. US law generally prohibits lawsuits against other countries with few exceptions, said Chimene Keitner, an international law professor at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.“The legal problem is, it’s just not possible,” said Keitner, who recently wrote a blog titled “Don’t Bother Suing China for Coronavirus.”Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a “stunt” by a Republican attorney general who is up for re-election this year.The number of Missouri deaths statewide rose by 16 on Tuesday to 215, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Centre for Systems Science and Engineering.

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With a price of £419, it very nearly matches the lowest debut price for an iPhone, too. That was the original iPhone SE which launched in March 2016 for £359.This is the first time Apple has recycled a phone’s name. The original SE (the two letters don’t stand for anything, by the way) matched the chassis of the iPhone 5s with a much newer, more powerful processor – the chip from the iPhone 6s. Since the processor is the most important component in a phone, having the most up-to-date one was remarkable.The new iPhone SE follows the same process. The iPhone 8, first launched in 2017, is the body that’s used here, but the very latest A13 Bionic processor from last autumn’s iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro is waiting inside. The A13 Bionic is the fastest processor ever in a smartphone.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNot only does this mean the iPhone SE runs very fast, with the latest apps compatible and the most advanced games running smoothly, it also allows the camera to be way more effective than it was in the iPhone 8, even though the hardware is basically unchanged.Apple says it is the most advanced single-camera system it has ever made – more powerful than the one in the iPhone XR (released in 2018) and currently priced from £629. If taking good photos is important to you, the SE is arguably the one you’d go for, and save £210 as you do.The reasons for choosing the XR, by the way, would include an OLED display that’s bigger than the SE and covers almost the entire front of the phone, plus facial recognition features.If you’ve ever seen the iPhone 8, then you know what this phone looks like. It is almost identical apart from tiny design enhancements such as moving the Apple logo on the back to the centre. This also means that, glass back apart, it’s similar to the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s (except this phone has no headphone jack) and iPhone 7. It’s what Apple would call a beloved design.There’s a 4.7in LCD display with right-angled corners, not the curved corners to match the bezel found on the iPhone X onwards. There are noticeable non-screen areas at the top and bottom of the phone, with the front-facing camera at the top and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor in the Home button at the bottom. This is in contrast to many flagship phones where the display creeps right to the edges.The display looks good, and you quickly forget about the blank areas. But it’s certainly a change, though as someone who routinely uses a bigger-screened phone, the biggest change in using the iPhone SE was how much smaller everything was, especially the keyboard. I’m used to the bigger screen and my fingers no longer seem dainty enough to type accurately and at speed on a small one, though it’s still usable. For comparison, I also tried typing on the original iPhone SE, which, with its 4in display, was just too small, now. And, let’s remember, the first five iPhones came with a smaller screen than that. How times change.Apple routinely puts potent processors in its phones, but as subsequent hardware and advanced apps create greater demand, faster chips are needed. The fact that the iPhone SE’s processor is so much more powerful than previous iPhones – and the processors in any other phone, actually – makes the SE attractive. Not only does everything happen at speed, from opening apps to smooth video playback, it makes the hardware capable of much more.The camera is a case in point. It’s actually the same camera, in sensor and component terms, that the iPhone 8 had in 2017. Apple didn’t need to upgrade the camera hardware to make its photographic capabilities better. That’s because so much of smartphone photography is now down to the software.Battery life is good, though the huge leap forward Apple introduced with the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro is not matched here. But it is easily enough to get you through a full day with no anxiety. Unlike the original iPhone SE, the glass back means this one is wirelessly rechargeable.It’s not that the iPhone 8 camera was poor – it had a lot of strong features, but the addition of the A13 Bionic chip is transformational. Now, much more is possible.Portrait mode, where the background is blurred while your subject is in sharp focus, wasn’t on the iPhone 8. Usually it needs two cameras shooting together to work out what’s the subject and what’s background. But from the iPhone XR onwards, and on some smartphones from Google, for instance, this effect is achieved in software.Here, as on the iPhone XR, portrait mode only works for people, so gorgeous photos of pets won’t have that buttery defocused background. The A13 Bionic means it can do a very good job with people, and even allows you to adjust the level of background blur afterwards, helpfully showing you the aperture equivalent in the result.You can also add special effects, like stage light which turns the background into the darkness outside the spotlight.It also does something called semantic rendering. No, me neither, but it’s really about how the machine learning in the chip can take an image to pieces and rebuild it once it’s understood what’s in the frame, processing hair differently from skin, from eyes and so on.There’s a danger when you rely on algorithms and computer chips instead of, well, great glass and studio lighting, for instance. If the programmers have got things even a tiny bit wrong, the results can be tragic.Fortunately, the engineers at Apple who make these decisions are the most accomplished around. Much more importantly than that, they have exceptionally good taste.This is the only iPhone to combine a single camera sensor and the A13 Bionic chip, so perhaps it’s not surprising the photos it takes are deeply impressive.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It cost £50 more and had a much older processor.But, really, I should have been comparing it to the first iPhone SE. After all, that was the first iPhone designed to be super-affordable as well as mighty powerful, thanks to its then-current cutting-edge processor.But while the first iPhone SE at the time was the right size to feel comfortable and easy to manage, now, it just seems tiny. The new phone, compared to most phones on the market, is compact without being titchy, and is a great fit in the hand.The new iPhone SE is a world away from the first, with 64GB storage (the original had 16GB), that larger display, improved design and – above all – the fastest phone processor on the planet. Its lead-in price of £419 is amazingly competitive and will make it a blockbuster seller. Remember, this phone is £730 cheaper than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. That phone has a lot of extra features and a huge screen, but both phones share the same storage capacity and processor.If you want the latest features such as Face ID, triple cameras and an all-screen front to your smartphone, well, Apple can oblige with its iPhone 11 series. But for many, that will be overkill.If you want something compact, highly affordable but still every bit as speedy as the fastest phone money can buy, then the iPhone SE is hard to resist.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Netflix had predicted it would add 7 million during the period.The company warned that it expected fewer new subscribers from July to December compared with a year earlier, however. Many people who would have joined then are likely to have already signed up, executives said.Tiger King is one of Netflix’s biggest ever showsWe expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The company is among the few businesses to benefit from government orders imposed in March to keep people away from each other in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious novel coronavirus. While the S\u0026ampP 500 Index has fallen 19 per cent\u0026nbspfrom its 19 February record high, Netflix has gained 11 per cent\u0026nbspduring the same period.Netflix also issued a bullish forecast that it would add 7.5 million new customers for the current quarter, which ends in June, though the company said it was mostly guesswork given uncertainty over when stay-at-home orders might be lifted. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 3.8 million.Investing senior analyst Haris Anwar said Netflix\u0027s big gains showed it\u0027s the ultimate stay-at-home stock.That said, there\u0027s no guarantee that a global recession and increased competition won\u0027t hit Netflix in the latter part of the year, Anwar said. There\u0027s little clarity from the company about the future, and that\u0027s likely to hurt the stock in the short run.Netflix said the shutdown of film and TV production around the world had temporarily increased its free cash flow but could delay some programming by a quarter. In the second quarter, the impact will be modest and mostly will affect dubbing in various languages, the company said.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.57, below the $1.65 consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Total revenue rose to $5.77 billion from $4.52 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.76 billion.Appreciation of the U.S. dollar, due partially to the coronavirus crisis, dragged on international revenue, the company said.In the quarter, Netflix true-crime documentary Tiger King, about a colorful Oklahoma zookeeper, became a cultural sensation. It also released reality show Love is Blind, and a new season of Spanish-language thriller Money Heist.As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive with the debut of Walt Disney Co\u0027s Disney+ and upcoming rivals. That has pushed Netflix to look for growth overseas.The company\u0027s biggest expansion from January through March came from Europe, where it added 4.4 million new customers.The most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+.Netflix does not currently plan to raise its prices given the global pandemic, Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said.At this point we are not even thinking about price increases, Peters said.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We can’t replace the people we lose,’ says retail bossCath Kidston permanently closed all of its stores with the loss of 900 jobs, while Primark\u0027s\u0026nbspowner said sales had fallen to zero and it had furloughed 68,000 staff on another ominous day for British retailers, who have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, pubs, bars and restaurants warned MPs that they face a “bloodbath” as lockdown conditions are eased, with up to a third of the sector at risk of going out of business.Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns budget retailer Primark, was the first to sound the alarm on Tuesday, as it revealed that sales had dropped from £650m per month to zero as a result of all its stores closing in Europe and the US.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnlike many rivals, Primark does not sell clothes online\u0026nbsp— meaning it has been unable to mitigate lost revenues by ramping up deliveries to customers’ homes.ABF boss George Weston said the group had been “squarely in the path of this pandemic” and would have had to have laid off staff if governments had not implemented furlough schemes which cover wage costs.Pre-tax profits slumped 42 per cent to £298m for the half-year to February as Primark was left with millions of pounds of stock it was unable to sell. The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sometimes we just have toast and butter for dinner,\u0027 says teenager who isn\u0027t receiving free school meal vouchers due to her father\u0027s immigration statusAbeke*, 17, struggles to concentrate on the algebra in her A-level maths book because her stomach keeps rumbling. She would get a snack but there’s nothing to eat. Since the lockdown started, food has been limited.“We’re having smaller portions, and sometimes there is nothing. Sometimes we just have toast and butter for dinner,”\u0026nbspthe sixth former tells The Independent. She lives at her aunt\u0027s house in Hackney with her father and 13-year-old sister – with whom she shares a small bed – and they have all gone hungry on numerous occasions since the coronavirus pandemic started.The Nigerian family has been in the UK for 13 years, so the two girls know nothing other than this country. But Ismail, their father, has a leave to remain application pending, and due to his current lack of status they have no recourse to public funds (NRPF) –\u0026nbspmeaning they cannot access state benefits,\u0026nbspnot even free school meals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile this was just about manageable before, coronavirus has meant a lot of the support networks they previously relied on have fallen away, leaving them unable to afford the basics.Ismail, 47,\u0026nbspwho has not been able to work legally since being in the UK,\u0026nbspunderwent surgery on 2 March\u0026nbspfor gallstones and a hernia, and despite not having fully recovered he has to sleep on the sofa every\u0026nbspnight.“Since I’ve been here I’ve been struggling, but since the pandemic started, it’s been unbearable, he says.\u0026nbsp“Before, some people were able to support me, but now everyone has their own problems. They are struggling as well. We can’t afford to buy food. Sometimes I go without meals so that my daughters can eat. If they need sanitary products, I struggle to get it. They are not happy.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“I just want to work. I feel bad relying on everyone else.\u0026nbspIf I was able to work I could provide for myself. I could pay my tax, be a good citizen, contribute to the economy. But I need my papers, and I need a place for me and my daughters.”One ray of hope might have been the government\u0027s decision on 6 April, following a legal challenge, to extend free school meals to thousands of families who have NRPF\u0026nbspduring the\u0026nbsppandemic. This should have meant Abeke\u0026nbspand her sister\u0026nbspreceive supermarket vouchers to pay for meals during the pandemic,\u0026nbspbut no guidance was published by the government until Monday – and when it was, it revealed that they didn\u0027t qualify.The Department for Education (DfE)\u0026nbspsaid it would apply only to children receiving\u0026nbspsection 17 support – a form of local authority provision\u0026nbspwhich charities say is notoriously difficult for families to access – or section 4\u0026nbspasylum support,\u0026nbspmeaning Abeke and her sister, along with thousands of other children, will not benefit.A new report by Hackney Migrant Centre, seen exclusively by The Independent, warns that for people who were already made destitute by NRPF, their situation is likely to become even worse during the pandemic. It states that, as communities and charities are impacted, many with NRPF\u0026nbspwill have lost support they had been surviving on, leading to more people going hungry.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt also warns that many people with\u0026nbspNRPF\u0026nbspare losing their jobs or working shorter hours because of the lockdown, with those who work informally or on zero hours contracts unable to benefit from government\u0027s support measures to protect incomes, often making rent and basic necessities unaffordable.Amina, 35, arrived in the UK from Algeria with her husband Mohamed, also 35, since 2012. They currently live with their three children, aged nine, six and one, in Leighton, east London where they rent in two rooms – a bedroom and a living room – that belong to a friend of theirs at a reduced cost. But they have been given notice to leave by the end of May.The Algerian nationals were granted leave to remain in October last year, after paying £14,000 to apply, but it has a NRPF\u0026nbspcondition attached to it. Mohamed had worked in a butcher’s shop, but it closed two weeks ago due to the pandemic, so they currently have no income, and they can’t claim any form of state benefit.\u0026nbspThey now rely on the local food bank where they pick up a package of food once a week to survive off.The people left with nothing because of coronavirus lockdown“I’m worried. I’m trying my best to find somewhere to go. If you go to an agency they won’t let you have two bedrooms for five people. But then you go to the council and they say you’re lucky you have one bedroom and a sitting room for five people you’re fine,” Amina tells The Independent.Her primary school-aged daughters have not been offered free school meal vouchers despite the government announcement two weeks ago. Amina says she hopes this does come to fruition, as the family is currently reliant on what the food bank is able to give them.The Hackney Migrant Centre report concludes that free school meals are essential to protect some of the most vulnerable children from hunger when there may not be enough to eat at home, and calls on ministers to ensure\u0026nbspthat all pupils\u0026nbspfrom low income families, regardless of immigration status, are able to rely on them during the Covid-19 pandemic and after it.Stephanie*, a Nigerian asylum seeker, lives in east London with her 13-year-old British-born twins. She says their school gave her children free school meal vouchers last week, but could not guarantee that they would give anymore due to their status. Now she is having to ration their food.“When they were in school it was okay, because by the time they come home it’s getting dark. You just give them food and everyone goes to bed. But now they want to snack. It’s not easy, but they don’t understand. If they say \u0027Mum, I’m hungry,\u0027 you can’t just\u0026nbspsay no,” she says.“I try to feed them well, but I can’t give them a full plate. I have to ration it. It’s unfair on them because as they get older, they eat more. You can’t tell a child not to grow. They are suffering.”The 43-year-old, who is appealing a refused asylum claim, explains that as well as struggling to pay for enough food for the family on the £116 she gets a week from the Home Office, she feels guilty that she can’t afford better facilities to enable her children to do their homework.Stephanie adds: “We have no laptop, no internet at home. They have to take it in turns to borrow my phone to do their homework, and before you know it the data is gone. They are frustrated. I don’t know who to turn to. The school isn’t helping.Nadia Chalabi, school meals advocate at Hackney Migrant Centre, says the new guidance on children with NRPF\u0026nbspis shockingly discriminatory, adding:\u0026nbspThis extension has not been designed to reach all children in need, instead it feels like the smallest and most temporary concession that the\u0026nbspDfE\u0026nbspcould come up with.Thousands of undocumented children who are not receiving section 4 or section 17 support continue to be excluded from free school meals despite being vulnerable to total destitution as they are cared for by adults who are denied the right to work and denied access to welfare support.She also raised concern that the DfE guidance states that families with NRPF on their leave to remain on the private life or family route can receive free school meal vouchers during the pandemic, but only if their whole household income is below £616 per month.Ms Chalabi says it came as welcome news that some families with NRPF will now be able to access free school meals during the pandemic, but highlighted\u0026nbspthat many\u0026nbsphave continued to struggle in the\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbspweeks it took\u0026nbspfor the guidance to be published.Low income families with NRPF\u0026nbspfaced financial, food and housing insecurity before the pandemic. Now families face eviction as hosts take measures to protect their household from the spread of the virus, and financial support is stopping as support networks face financial insecurity themselves, she adds.Free school meals are essential for every child in need regardless of immigration status, there will never be equal access to education without them. It is shameful that the DfE continues to deny the support of free school meals from some of the poorest children in society because of where they or their parents were born.The Department for Education has been contacted for comment.*Some names have been changedAsylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered.

Now, writes Mark Critchley,\u0026nbspthere are fears this gathering of more than 50,000 fans could prove to have been\u0026nbspa costly errorLittle more than a month ago, coronavirus was beginning to grip Britain. There were almost 600 cases, UK deaths were being counted and doctors in northern Italy were warning of the nightmare to come. But at Anfield on 11 March, more than 52,000 people made their way to Anfield to watch Liverpool’s\u0026nbspelimination from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the stands.The crowd that night included 3,000 away supporters who had largely travelled from Madrid, despite the match coming a day after gatherings of more than 1,000 people had been banned in Spain.At that stage – before keeping two metres from the next person became a way of life – the UK government’s policy was that shutting down mass gatherings like the match at Anfield or the Cheltenham Festival, held the same week, would have only a minimal effect on limiting the spread of the coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEven in the days that followed, once the Premier League and Football League took matters into their own hands and suspended fixtures, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told journalists at No 10’s daily press briefing that banning mass gatherings was not a priority.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIt took until the following Monday – 16 March, five days after the game at Anfield and the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspdeclaration that humanity was in the grip of a pandemic – for Boris Johnson to finally advise against large-scale events. There were 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Merseyside at the time. Now, there are nearly 3,000, with 448 deaths recorded in the region’s hospitals.In light of those numbers and the growing nationwide death toll, it is only natural to ask whether the match at Anfield that night – the last match to be held in Britain with such a high attendance – should have gone ahead at all.For Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby, there’s no need for hindsight to see the incorrect decision was made – he says the warning signs were there all along. Byrne is a lifelong Liverpool supporter who would have attended the match if he had not been working in parliament. Instead, he gave his ticket to his son and – alongside fellow Merseyside MPs Dan Carden and Maria Eagle – worked to raise the issue with health secretary Matt Hancock in the House of Commons.“It was a massive, massive concern,” Byrne says, finding the presence of fans from an emerging coronavirus hotspot particularly baffling. At the time, 782 of Spain’s 1,646 cases were contained in the capital. “If we were playing in Madrid, they wouldn’t be able to attend. Suddenly they can all get on planes, come here without any hindrance, attend the game in the city and act like you would act, doing what you want to do and enjoying the event.”There is a sense warnings from elsewhere were not heeded either. Three weeks earlier, a Champions League game between Atalanta – a team from Bergamo, the epicentre of Italy’s crisis – and Valencia was played in Milan. The match has been described by Bergamo’s mayor as a “biological bomb” which accelerated the spread of the virus in Lombardy. “It was out there, the evidence was out there but it wasn’t getting listened to. We weren’t listened to,” says Byrne. “I just found it utterly infuriating.”On the evening of the game, Hancock responded to questions in the Commons by claiming that it was too easy to draw a link between crowds and contagion. “Sometimes the things that we, as lay people, may feel intuitively will have the biggest impact do not in fact have the biggest impact,” he said. “There are some things that feel right but do not have an impact at all.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut Sridhar Venkatapuram, of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, can only politely describe the relaxed attitude towards mass gatherings during the early days of the crisis as “very interesting”, with a clear note of scepticism. “If we care about iniduals going out of their house, then 50,000 people coming together should worry us even more,” he says. “Concerts, sports matches, political rallies, pilgrimages: all these kinds of things intensify the frequency at which people will come into contact with each other and the rate at which the virus is infecting other people.“If there are 54,000 fans at a football stadium, I cannot tell you exactly where the greatest infections happen. I would be able to tell you that if you put two people together, it’s more likely the second person is going to be infected as opposed to one person being on their own. If one person is infected and surrounded by 10 people, it’s more likely that more than one other person is going to be infected.”And of course, football matches not only mean tens of thousands of fans shouting and cheering in close proximity to each other. They also involve them eating, drinking and socialising together in public spaces, then travelling together on public transport. “There’s nothing better than going to a European away game,” Byrne says. “Obviously the Spanish fans would have taken full advantage of the hospitality that Liverpool would have given them.”Venkatapuram believes that, by 11 March, the unnecessary risk of holding large events should have been clear. “Seeing a variety of patterns, seeing France, Italy and all these countries taking drastic steps, the UK should have been much more concerned about the health and wellbeing of its citizens and should have started to work on the big issues: should international travel be stopped? Should large gatherings of 50,000 people be stopped?”Those are questions that Byrne hopes will be answered by a future inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus crisis. “Hopefully once we all get through this and we can have a look at how it was handled and how we learn from it,” he says. And if\u0026nbspevidence emerges that events of 11 March contributed to Merseyside’s developing crisis, he wants the Anfield decision to be revisited. “That should be an absolute key part of any report.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Labour claimed there had been a “shambolic” response to credible offers of vital kit from several companies.Health secretary Matt Hancock is facing\u0026nbspquestions in the Commons about participation in an EU scheme to secure equipment, after the Foreign Office’s top civil servant Sir Simon McDonald made an extraordinary U-turn – withdrawing his own claim the UK made a “political decision” not to take part.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStarmer attacks\u0026nbsp‘pattern’ of slow government responsesHancock faces\u0026nbspquestions on EU procurement scheme84 health workers have died from coronavirus, ministers confirmLib Dems call for public inquiry into handling of crisisGovernment to ban gender confirmation surgery for under-18sThe equalities minister has announced the government will set out plans to ban under-18s from undergoing gender confirmation surgery.Liz Truss said the government\u0027s full response to reforming the Gender Recognition Act will be published this summer, two years after former women and equalities minister Penny Mordaunt launched a public consultation into how trans people change their legal gender on their birth certificates.Under the existing Gender Recognition Act, a trans person has to undergo a two-year waiting period and a review from a specialist panel before being able to change their gender legally.Addressing the Women and Equalities Committee on Wednesday, Ms Truss outlined very important principles the government would set out over the act, including the protection of single-sex spaces and making sure that transgender adults are free to live their lives as they wish without fear of persecution.But she also signalled plans to ban under-18s with gender dysphoria from genital reconstructive surgery.Currently, people under the age of 18 are allowed surgery with parental consent - although the process is so long drawn out that in reality few teenagers are able to undergo irreversible surgery before they reach adulthood.Downing Street defends government\u0027s efforts to source PPE from British firmsThe prime minister\u0027s official spokesman said: If PPE is available and, crucially, if it meets the standards which are required for usage in the NHS and care homes - because obviously its vital that staff are protected in the proper way - then we will look to obtain this material from within the UK as quickly as possible.Priority was being given to firms which have the largest amounts of stock and those which have items in high demand, the spokesman said.PPE equipment from Turkey being \u0027inspected and processed\u0027\u0026nbsp(Steve ParsonsPA)Downing Street has said a consignment of personal protective equipment from Turkey is being inspected and processed after being brought to the UK by the RAF this morning.The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman said that was a standard procedure when PPE was brought in from overseas.They are processing it now and they will move it on to the frontline as quickly as possible, the spokesman said.Labour leader calls for \u0027swift\u0027 inquiry into leaked anti-semitism dossierSir Keir Starmer has called for the inquiry into the leaked anti-semitism dossier to be swift ahead of a meeting of the party\u0027s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Thursday.His spokesman said: The NEC is meeting tomorrow and at that meeting they will agree the terms of reference for the inquiry.Keir has made it clear that he wants it to be a swift investigation.\u0026nbspPressed on how quick swift is, the spokesman replied: A matter of months. That\u0027s his objective as part of rebuilding the Labour Party and improving trust. There will be more clarity tomorrow.Hancock commits to mental health support for frontline NHS staffMr Hancock has committed to having mental health support available for all frontline NHS workers until long after the pandemic has concluded.Responding to Tory Dr Luke Evans\u0027 (Bosworth) concerns for health care workers\u0027 well-being, Mr Hancock said: We\u0027ve put in place a helpline for all frontline workers in the NHS to make sure that they have the support that they need, and I will make sure, working with the honourable members and others, I\u0027ll make sure that support stays in place long after this crisis is over.In response to the SNP\u0027s Patrick Grady\u0027s question on the number of European nurses, Mr Hancock said: There is no impact at all of Brexit on our coronavirus response.Will it be possible to track and trace every new Covid-19 case by the time government considers lifting lockdown?Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asked if it will be possible to track and trace every new Covid-19 case in the community in the next two weeks, at the point the cabinet will consider whether to lift the lockdown.Mr Hunt, chairman of the health select committee, also asked Mr Hancock: Will he appoint a big-hitter from outside frontline politics to really make sure this happens in a very short period of time, as he has very sensibly done with Sir Paul Deighton on PPE?\u0026nbspMr Hancock replied: We are ramping up our testing capacity and our capacity for contact-tracing in a matter of weeks, and we\u0027ll have it ready to make sure that we can use that as and when the incidence of transmission comes down.It isn\u0027t as tied to the specific decision that we\u0027re required by law to take in just over two weeks\u0027 time.The effectiveness of test, track and trace to keep the reproductive rate of this virus down is determined by the incidence in the community and our goal is to get to a point where we can test, track and trace everybody who needs it.PARaab and Starmer resist calls for inquiryBoth Dominic Raab and Keir Starmer have resisted Lib Dem calls for an inquiry into the government\u0027s handling of the Covid-19 Crisis.Speaking during PMQs, Mr Raab said:\u0026nbspI have to say I won\u0027t take up his offer of committing to a public inquiry.\u0026nbspI think there are definitely lessons to be learned and when we get through this crisis it will be important that we take stock and we come together to understand with an unprecedented challenge on an international scale what can be done to avoid it happening again.\u0026nbspI think right now, from our key NHS frontline workers to the members of the public, they would rightly expect our full focus to be, as we come through the peak of this virus, to make sure that we save lives, protect the NHS and steer the whole country though this crisis rather than engaging in that process or that set of deliberations right now.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the new Labour leader said: Keir has said he believes serious mistakes have been made in the government\u0027s handling of the\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbsppandemic and ministers do need to be held accountable for those mistakes.The priority now has got to be on how the government fixes the current mistakes it is making.Hancock says 15 care home staff have died from Covid-19Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has asked Matt Hancock whether the government would publish the minutes of crucial Sage meetings, and also suggested the deaths for the coronavirus in care homes should be recorded on a daily basis.The health secretary said 15 care home staff had died after contracting the virus. Earlier foreign secretary Dominic Raab\u0026nbsptold the House that 69 NHS workers had died, bringing the number of heath and care staff killed so far to 84.“All deaths in care homes are of course recorded,”\u0026nbspsaid Hancock.“Yesterday there was some debate over whether the ONS figures showed that the deaths … outside of hospitals were 40 per cent higher. It turns out that wasn’t turn and that was comparing apples with pears, and the real figure is closer to 20 per cent.”Spare capacity in critical care, says HancockHealth secretary Matt Hancock has made a statement in the Commons, revealing there are now more than 3,000 spare critical care beds in the NHS.He said large scale contact tracing will be introduced as the coronavirus cases are brought down, and claimed we were now at the peak of the virus – as he thanked the public for maintaining social distancing during the lockdown.“It is making a difference … we are at the peak.”WHO ‘not perfect’, says RaabLabour MP Angela Eagle has asked Dominic Raab whether the government believes the World Health Organisation still has a “critical” role in security global health security, given Donald Trump’s recent withdrawal of US funding.She called Trump’s action “disgraceful vendetta”.Raab replied: “On the WHO, we recognise it has a role to play. It is not perfect, no international institution is, we do need to work to reform it. But we’ve made clear we consider an important part of the international response.”Labour backbencher suggests government hasn’t followed expert adviceLabour MP\u0026nbspBarry Gardiner\u0026nbsphas claimed that Sage, the government’s scientific advisory group, recommended a lockdown at the end of February. “The government likes to claim it has been following the scientific advice. But it hasn’t, has it?”Raab rejected the idea – claiming the government had followed scientific advice at all times.“We’ve protected our NHS – it hasn’t been overwhelmed in the way some had feared ... we are starting to come through this\u0026nbsppeak, and that has only happened because we’ve taken the right decisions based on the evidence we’ve had.”SNP MP calls for universal basic incomeThe SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford is the first MP to get to ask a question remotely.He said his party is calling for a universal basic income (UBI) to help everyone struggling financially during the crisis, before asking Raab whether the government would support the move. “It will leave no-one behind,” he said.Raab said he didn’t agree an\u0026nbspuniversal basic income wasn’t necessary – pointing to existing benefits and the support packages outlined by the chancellor.Labour leader says ‘pattern’ of failures emergingKeir Starmer said PPE manufacturers had got in touch with the opposition about their struggle to get a reply from the government on offers to supply the NHS with vital kit.“Something is going wrong,” said the Labour leader. “There is a pattern emerging here. We were slow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment and now slow to take up these offers.”He urges the government to work with the opposition to get some of these offers taken up “as soon as possible”.Raab replied by saying “I don’t accept his premise that we’ve been slow,” and claiming ministers were guided by scientific advice.Raab: 69 NHS staff have died of Covid-19Dominic Rabb said 69 NHS employees had now died after contracting the coronavirus, after Keir Starmer asked for the figures for health service and care workers.“I don’t have the precise figure for care homes,” the foreign secretary said.Starmer said he would ask again next week. “Hopefully we can get a better answer.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During a train stop in China early last year, she was given the job of extinguishing her brother’s cigarette.Some analysts said\u0026nbspthat she has the only real characteristic that matters in the North Korean system – being of the “Paektu blood line”, a direct descendent of the Kim dynasty.But North Korea is also a rigid patriarchy, and her gender would most likely rule her out as anything more than a caretaker leader in the event of her brother’s demise.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimply put, said\u0026nbspLeif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul: “The North Korean system could not continue in its current ideological and institutional form without an adult male descendant of Kim Il-sung.”Kim Jong-un\u0026nbsphas a surviving older brother, who was passed over for consideration when Kim Jong-il decided which of his children to groom as the country’s next leader.Kim Jong-chol is said to have been more keen on music and playing guitar than politics, and is living a quiet life away from the spotlight in North Korea, according to Thae Yong-ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.He was last spotted in 2011 enjoying an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore, according to South Korean broadcaster KBS. Like his brother, he also studied abroad in Switzerland.According to Kenji Fujimoto, the Japanese man who claims to have been the personal sushi chef for Kim Jong-il, the late North Korean leader\u0026nbspdecided Kim Jong-chol was too “girlish” to lead the country. It would seem to be a long shot for him to return to the fold of public life.The private life of North Korea’s first family is notoriously shrouded in mystery, but we do know that he has been married to former singer and cheerleader Ri Sol-ju since 2009.South Korea’s intelligence services believe the couple have had three children – including a son born in 2010, a daughter born around 2013 and third child in 2017.Bizarrely, perhaps the best insight into the Kim family came from the 2013 visit of US basketball star Dennis Rodman, who described Kim Jong-un as a “good dad” to his then-young daughter Ju Ae.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un: Decade in pictures of North Korean leader Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un rides a horse during

Central News Agency on 16 October 2019Kim Jong-un inspects the Command of the Strategic Force of the Korean People\u0027s Army at an undisclosed location in August 2017The ages of Kim’s children mean that a form of regency would be required until his eldest son was old enough to take over.Nonetheless, US officials believe that keeping control of the country within the family is still the most likely outcome. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Donald Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said of any succession: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family.”North Korea’s most senior officials have stayed in their jobs through unflinching loyalty to the Kim family, sometimes over multiple generations.In the event that new leadership is required, it is possible that several high-ranking Workers’ Party elders could team up to see the country through any transition.After decades of service including as Kim Jong-un’s first military chief, Choe Ryong-hae rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year becoming the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly.He and Pak Pong-ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more elements of a free market to revive its economy, would be the likely figureheads of any collective leadership.In such a scenario, the former top nuclear envoy Kim Yong-chol and foreign minister Ri Son-gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues including stalled denuclearisation talks with South Korea and Washington, as they played key roles in previous summits with Trump.“Kim now puts his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong in charge of many things, and she is the only sibling and trusted confidante inside his cabinet. Ultimately, though, it is his son who would inherit the kingdom,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil, because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an -hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable -ply masks are fluid-resistant are the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, theyre effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP  filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than an N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airbone particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.Theres been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of houeshold materials that could be used as maks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. The British public hasnt been advised to wear face masks to protect against coronavirus - unless youre caring for someone with the disease or you work on the frontline.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Good Morning Britain: Masks are very important to protect healthcare workers...Butisnt something that weve done here because weve followed the advice.And weve followed the medical and scientic advice and the whole basis of our response has been making sure that we follow the science.However scientic advisers for the Government are carrying out a review of the use of face masks.Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has also signalled that No could change its mind on the use of masks.Homemade masks wont offer the same level of protection as medical-grade ones, but it hasnt stopped DIY tutorials popping up online.One of the simplest ones involves using two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape - and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.Officials in New York City are urging people to wear masks when they go outside.Mayor Bill de Blasio said coverings for the nose and mouth can be real homegrown and made from a scarf or bandana.It is believed new US Government guidance would suggest non-medical masks, T-shirts or bandanas be used to cover the nose and mouth when outside the home, while professional-grade masks are kept for healthcare workers.In Europe, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina have introduced these measures.Residents in the Philippines have to wear a mask in public, and the same is true in some of the worst-affected provinces in China.In Japan, where masks were already a household staple, the government plans to post two gauze masks to each of the countrys  million households.People in Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan regularly wear masks because of air pollution.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I attacked the nearest from behind. I fired two bursts...I then saw the enemy aircraft fall out of formation and crash to the ground.I was then attacked from behind and forced down.After ing to Britain his second enemy kill came on June  when he shot down another Messerschmidt  over Abbeville, France.On July  over Dover he destroyed a Heinkel bomber which crashed in the sea with the loss of three of the crew.During the Battle of Britain Sq Ldr Hart was required to fly five sorties in a single day.He claimed a fourth kill - another Me  - on August  over Margate and then survived another crash landing at Foulness, Essex.On August  he gained ace status with a fth enemy plane destroyed followed by a sixth in November .He then joined No.  Squadron and served in the Middle East. He claimed three more kills while providing escort cover for RAF bombers ahead of the Allied advance on Tobruk in Libya.Sq Ldr Hart was awarded the DFC in February  for his great courage and skill in operational duties.Little is known of his RAF career for the following two years but he was posted to No.  Squadron in Italy in February .There he flew in another  sorties up until December when he was killed in action.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it’s terrying. I don’t remember much of the next  days.A recent study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, suggests people might experience digestive issues, such as diarrhoea, when they are infected with coronavirus.Researchers analysed data from  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and they discovered that . per cent of these patients arrived at the hospital with digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain.Following this, the researchers stated that, for some people, digestive symptoms may present itself first before the respiratory symptoms of Covid-.The study noted: These data emphasize that patients with new-onset digestive symptoms after a possible Covid- contact should be suspected for the illness, even in the absence of cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or fever.It also explained that patients with digestive symptoms suffered longer than those with respiratory symptoms - citing the average hospital stay as . days.In the study, the people included in the study also had a more severe case of illness.Brennan M.R. Spiegel, co-editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, said: In this study, Covid- patients with digestive symptoms have a worse clinical outcome and higher risk of mortality compared to those without digestive symptoms, emphasising the importance of including symptoms like diarrhoea to suspect Covid- early in the disease course before respiratory symptoms develop.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature, as well as shortness of breath - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This must be a key consideration.If the Government is going to consider advising the general public to wear facemasks it must fully assess the impact on the NHS.It comes after weeks of debate from experts on whether face masks will have an effect on the spread of the virus or not.The World Health Organizationhas said there is no evidence to support the use of face masks by the general population - and only people in health care settings should use them.From dust masks to homemade coverings with cloth, there are a iety of protection methods popping up as people look for ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil, because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an -hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable -ply masks are fluid-resistant are the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, their effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP  filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask, it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than an N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airborne particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.There have been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of household materials that could be used as maks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. But earlier this week  top doctors called for the public to wear face coverings whenever they leave their home, piling pressure on scientists to change tack.Americans in some states are being told to wear them when they go outside, and people in France will be given them when lockdown measures are eased in the coming weeks.The German state of Saxony has made them compulsory in shops and on public transport, and Spain is giving them out to commuters.Oxford University Professor Trish Greenhalgh, who has published evidence reviewing facemasks said they do help stop the spread of coronavirus.She told The Times: Your mask doesn’t protect you but it protects other people. A mask needs to be an item of clothing.It’s like a T-shirt, wear it and chuck it in the wash. Detergent kills Covid.It is not yet clear how the rules -they are changed - will be enforced.Police have taken a tough stance on enforcing social distancing rules so far which are part of the new laws - but this guidance may fall outside of that.London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer, and former PM Tony Blair have both added their voices to the calls for facial coverings and masks.Ministers have been considering for weeks whether to change advice, but have insisted they will be guided by the science.Teachers have also warned they may not go back to school without masks or other PPE to protect them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-oldaposs condition had at one point been so serious she was told to say goodbye to her husband Craig and children Imogen,  and Daniel, . As she watched four other patients die, she even asked nursesshe was next. Thankfully, she is now the first patient with the deadly virus to be discharged from the ICU unit at the Conquest Hospital in Hastings. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here The civil servant, who was also told she had developed pneumonia, said nothing was too much for the NHS staff who treated her. I can never thank the nurses enough, she said. I could see some of them almost passing out because the PPE was unbearable. But they never once made a fuss or complained. I just thought oh my gosh they are doing all this for us. They are not only providing medical support but they are providing that human, personal and emotional support you need. It was constant care, holding my hand and giving me reassurance. I asked them a few times was I dying and they took the time to sit with me and reassure me that I was OK. The staff even lined up to clap her away when she was well enough to be discharged. I just remember feeling overwhelmed and the staff were waving and cheering me on, she continued.  It should have been me applauding them. They are heroes. Ruth, who had no underlying health conditions, says she first fell ill on March  when she developed a cough. After she was sent home from her job at the Department for Work and Pensions, she developed a fever and began self-isolating at home. But a week later her breathing became so bad that her worried husband dialled . Craig says I was wheezing and it sounded like I was having an asthma attack, she says.  I had no time to say goodbye to my kids who were asleep when the ambulance came. I was in total shock. She was admitted to the ICU after testing positive for Covid-, and hours later, staff told her they would have to put her in an induced coma and that now was the time to make any phone calls. I called Craig but he didnapost answer so I had to ask the doctors to tell him I loved him and the kids, Ruth continued. It was terrying. Ruth says she is amazed by the compassion nurses showed to those patients she was treated alongside who did not make it. They were all alone, she said. The nurses held their hands and were talking to them before and after. They were speaking so kindly. Their compassion really amazed me because it must have been so hard for them. It was heartbreaking and I spent a lot of time crying. After eventually being transferred to a high dependence unit and then a ward, Ruth was finally allowed home on April . She says the experience has left her feeling absolutely drained and that she sometimes wakes up with nightmares. I am struggling to sleep and am waking up with nightmares. I become very emotional sporadically, she said. But I am relieved to be at home and I feel so lucky to be alive.

Terry Johnson called an ambulance for Derek Campbell after he could see the look of death on his palaposs face during a worrying Facetime call, the Liverpool Echo reports. The -year-old from Mann Island, Liverpool, was rushed to the Royal Liverpool Hospital, where he was treated for Covid- that left him in an induced coma for five days. During a three-week survival fight he was treated for acute pneumonia, an ear infection that caused sepsis and travelled to his kidney, and as his blood pressure dropped and with no response to antibiotics over a  period, his family feared the worst.Howevr, the drain clearance manageraposs health gradually got better, as he started squeezing medics hands to show he could respond to pain. Derek is now back home with his partner being nursed back to full health after beating the disease, which his loved ones, at one dark point, didnapost think was possible. His daughter Samantha recalled how she desperately watched and called her dad from , miles away in Darwin, Australia. Derek had self-isolated when he experienced symptoms including a bad cough and flu-like ailments, staying indoors for  days. Samantha, who works Down Under for Qantas airlines, explained how her dad grew gradually more sick alone in his apartment while she listened during constant phone calls as his condition worsened. But despite dismissing Samanthaaposs concerns, over a period of days, his health appeared to plummet, with his temperature rising, his taste and smell disappearing, and with hallucinations of men running around his city centre home. Derek, whose girlfriend lives in Manchester, telephoned  for medical advice, but was told to stay at home unless he was struggling to breathe. Samantha said she was shocked when her dad explained he hadnapost eaten for days and his apartment had turned into a horror movie. She told the Echo: He was very convincing, he told me his temperature had dropped and he was feeling much better and not to worry, whilst we were on the phone his partner arrived to drop a food parcel at the door, so we ended the conversation. I called him again the next morning, he seemed calm and again told me not to worry he was doing ok, he told me he had ate a sandwich. He wasn’t making much sense he kept confusing his words, it wasn’t like dad at all.  He told me it was the devil, he just felt weak. He complained about his ear and said water was pouring from it on to his pillow. I advised dad to get antibiotics sent to the house, I believe he was sent ear drops from a friend. I was extremely worried, as was his partner, but thankfully, my dadaposs best friend Terry Johnson was too, the guy who saved my dadaposs le. He had been in contact with my dad too had helped him with prescriptions and had watch him decline from afar. He decided after speaking to my dad over FaceTime enough was enough and called an ambulance as he said he could see the look of death take over his face. Dad remembers the ambulance turn up he said they where in full PPE - it was something he will never forget. He felt like he was in a zombie movie. He was taken to the Royal Hospital and was taken for scans. Soon after the doctor told my dad he was very sick and that he had to place him in to an induced coma he quickly asked to speak to my dadaposs next of kin. ...I sent a message to my dad telling him how proud I was and I loved him, he read that message as it was a Facebook message and then was placed in to a coma.It gave me some peace, but watching the hours turn in to days on his activity was painful. From then on, we were told he was in a pretty bad way. ...we where absolutely heartbroken, the first  hours where the worst. You can’t visit, calling is permitted to one person only, you just have to wait. After days of showing no improvement, Derek slowly started to respond. Samantha said: The feeling was euphoric, we had cried so much over the days. It was a pain I can’t explain. This was so dferent than anything, as you can’t do anything. Just before this had happened I got all my dadaposs friends and family to write positive things on his Facebook wall so he could wake up and read it.  As soon as we had his wall posted with love, he started to respond. Two days after, they decided he was doing that well they wanted to take him out of the coma. That was another win. The days went on, his eyes were open and they began to search for his phone, he was then taken out of intensive care. He couldnapost use his fingers for days, he was still on oxygen due to one of his lungs being badly affected still. It took him a few days to respond, each day was something dferent, first he was squeezing the nurses hands, next day he was nodding his head to respond to pain. In this time they told us he wouldn’t need dialysis for his kidney. It was like a miracle.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there was #xCrelatively low confidence#xD that a shipment of , surgical gowns which had been due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday would make its way into the country on Monday. The lack of PPE remains a dominant issue for NHS staff, as hospitals are forced into workarounds, including washing equipment and asking workers to accept wearing less protective gear. The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, has also reacted angrily to Government promises of more PPE, saying delays on the shipment from Turkey #xCmakes a dficult situation worse#xD. Its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said: #xCIt would have been better had the Government not made the announcement in the first place#xD and said staff would need to make their own assessment over whether they felt safe with the PPE currently on offer. Mr Hopson told Radio #xs Today programme that it was wrong to focus on inidual consignments of PPE because #xCbitter experience over the last few weeks#xD has shown they cannot be relied upon, with some boxes containing the wrong items and thousands of pieces missing. #xCSo rather than being marched up to the top of the hill and being marched back down again, let#xs just focus on what we know we can be certain of,#xD he said. #xCLet#xs not focus on inidual consignments, let#xs try and get as quickly as possible to a sustainable supply of these gowns. #xCThere#xs no doubt that at the moment, we have now got trusts that have definitely got shortages of gowns.#xD Mr Hopson said trusts were reserving the stock of fluid-resistant gowns they do have for areas of high clinical risk, such as intensive care units, and using workarounds in other areas. #xCThere#xs one trust that#xs basically discovered thatyou launder those gowns at  degrees ... there#xs probably up to three times that you can do that, and the gowns appear to still be fully fluid-repellent,#xD he said.

The shower - an annual event from April - - is to peak tonight, producing around  meteors per hour, and people have been sitting out in their gardens accompanied by duvets, hot chocolate and iPhones. At the same time, the billionaire Musk has launched a series of satellites aimed to providing a global internet service and between the two thereaposs been plenty to keep people watching the skies. Shona Moss, , said she and her partner got their six-year-old son out of bed at midnight and within  seconds the most amazing meteor Iaposve ever seen drew an arc across the sky. James Smith said: Man, the Lyrid meteor shower is spectacular and I’ve only been looking  minutes!!While Martina said: What a magical sky tonight! There are plenty of them!! But still waiting for that beautul, bright one, the most beautul Meteor like I saw last night shooting straight above my head! Oh please come on! Another Twitter user said: OMG ITaposS SO BEAUTIFUL. While Jamesh said at around .am: Just spotted an amazing meteor over Milton Keynes! Mesmerising. For some it was a less awe-inspiring experience and more tranquil.Phil Sloman said: Saw one meteor while watching the skies. Very peaceful experience with the sound of Tawny Owls in the nearby woods for accompaniment. Heading to bed now. The Lyrids are one of the oldest known meteor showers, having been observed for over , years.But with much of the world faced with uncertainty during coronavirus lockdown, it seems to have taken on more precedence this year - and people are appreciating the people around them as much whataposs going on in the sky.Brian Hill tweeted: Lovely hour in my back garden in Belfast with my we watching the meteor shower just under the starry plough. Many people pointed out that thanks to less air pollution, due to far fewer people heading out to work each day for the last month, the sky seemed clearer.Added to the meteors was the UFO-like lights also racing through the night sky, but these were not a natural phenomenon: rather a constellation of thousands of satellites designed to provide low-cost broadband internet service. The £ billion Starlink project has seen batches of satellites launched into the orbit  at a time, with a previous launch in late March and another tonight.They have been spotted all week in the UK due to their low Earth orbit, creating plenty of confusion on Twitter between Starlink and the meteor shower.One user with the handle @elliecov expressed her delight at spotting a aposmeteor showerapos, only to be left disappointed. First time I’ve ever seen a meteor shower and my inner child feels fulfilled that I finally got wish upon a shooting star, she tweeted.  However, later when she realised what sheaposd actually seen, she said: I’ve just found out the meteor shower was in fact Starlink satellites realigning and now I’m sad. But others were more impressed by both phenomenon and the chance to see them together. Twitter user Pamela said: Sitting in the garden with my sister with our duvets and a cup of hot chocolate watching the Starlink satellites and Lyrid meteor shower. Have seen   satellites so far in Glasgow, amazing. Love me some stargazing. While Scott Pottie wrote: Me and my  year old son watched them. He was so excited. Peter Laws added: Kids and I lay out in the garden for an hour under duvets and watched the #starlinksattelites. Saw them so clearly. While Han OaposConnor tweeted: Up early tomorrow but cheeky hour or so stargazing well spent. Great to see Starlink satellites, a beautul view of Venus and even lucky enough to see a meteor. The meteors come from leftover particles from Comet C  G Thatcher, and bits from broken asteroids. “When comets come around the sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them, NASA has explained. “Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

All we cared about was getting Peyton better and making sure she was safe. We couldnapost have lived with the guiltwe knew she had gotten it from one of us. We always wore a mask when we held her and followed all of the measures in place in the hospital. Tracy said the positive diagnosis on April  came as a complete shock to the couple.She added: We couldnapost believe it when we were told she had it. It hadnapost even crossed our minds that it could have been that. All she had was a runny noseI was sobbing and really worried about how it could affect her respiratory system, her lungs andit was le threatening.We were told we’d have to stay away from Peyton for  days and isolate at home but I pleaded not to be apart from my baby for that long. The staff kindly agreed I could to isolate with her in the hospital while AJ stayed at home. Peyton touched the nation’s hearts when she featured on BBC News on Monday night, in a report on the incredible efforts of staff at the Wishaw hospital.

Rachael Kirkwood has admitted that the Covid- measures have aposcertain challengesapos with long days and the house feeling like a aposconstant tipapos. Rachael and her husband both work from home and also have to deal with Oscar, , Oliver, eight, Mollie, three, two-year-old twins Niall and Luke and -month-old Orla, reports the Manchester Evening News. Like most young children, the youngest wake around am, so itaposs a long day to fill with fun activities and, for the older ones, school work too. Rachael has put together a video giving a snapshot of their lives right now - the ups and the downs - to remind herself of the fun times they are having amid the chaos and uncertainty. And she has the extra worry over the future of her business, the Mama Sanctuary in Stockport. The apospregnancy and motherhood hubapos only opened in December and has already been a hit with mums and mums-to-be. Aiming to make le easier for mums, the sanctuary gives them access to free childcare while accessing beauty treatments and other services like antenatal classes, sling libraries and breastfeeding support.  Rachael said: Itaposs hard work for sure, especially as theyaposre all dferent ages, but we are trying to make the most of what weaposve got and not get too stressed about little things. Weaposve been doing the Joe Wicks exercise every morning and tried to do some learning with the little ones, but they donapost really listen. The big boys have been good doing their work but we havenapost been too strict. You just have to take each day as it comes.  Itaposs such a long day when theyaposre waking up at am or youaposve got another waking in the night wanting to get in bed with you. I cannot wait to go back to work just to relax. The -year-old added: Itaposs very dficult to get two minutes to yourself unless everyoneaposs in bed. Having to close my shop has been an added stress on top of having all the kids. Iaposm still trying to do bits of work but itaposs not easy when youaposve got kids trying to climb on you. I did initially worry about the shop being closed for a while.  But so many people have messaged me saying they cannot wait for my Mama Sanctuary to open back up because they really need it - not just because they need their hair and nails  doing, but for their mental health and that little bit of time away  from the kids. Thereaposs so many ladies that cannot get out of the house unless they have childcare who say we are a leline. A typical routine before lockdown would have seen Oliver and Oscar in school from . each morning.  Mollie, Orla and the twins go to nursery two days a week and on Thursdays the twins stay overnight at their auntaposs to help the family out. The Mama Sanctuary creche has also been a godsend for helping with childcare. Itaposs all very dferent from the current set-up, where the children are with Rachael and her husband   at their home in Stalybridge. But between them, theyaposve been managing to keep them entertained, mainly in the garden. We had a big bath box and my husband decided to make a playhouse out of it, so I took over and painted it.  As I was painting it the kids said it was going to be their big school so it became our isolation school. It was actually pretty rewarding - they all love it and it made me feel better too, said Rachael. Weaposve had games of Connect , bikes rides, you name it, but it does get harder to keep them entertained. The older boys havenapost said much apart from theyaposre getting bored of their computer games now - I never thought Iaposd hear them say that. Oliver and Oscar spend a lot of time together and get on really well so they enjoy each otheraposs company. They havenapost managed to annoy each other yet. Itaposs the little ones that keep asking to go places. Mollie asks to go to the cafe and to mummyaposs work.  I usually take her to the cafe near work on a Friday so she always asks about that. She asked could we go to the movies the other day. Niall and Luke go to ice hockey on a Saturday morning in Altrincham - they are ice hockey obsessed. Theyaposve asked a few timestheyaposre going to ice hockey today or going to see family. Iaposve told them that nobody is allowed to go anywhere at the minute and we all have to stay at home and play in the garden. They are getting fed up. Weaposre trying to think of ways to keep them entertained but it isnapost easy. Rachael, who also has her own Mollie  Oli clothing brand for mums and children, says despite having a decent sized home, aposescaping isnapost an optionapos, as aposthereaposs always someone following you aroundapos.  I needed to take a call from my business mentor at the business growth hub so I had to get my husband to take everyone outside and lock the door, she said. If I didnapost do that theyaposd have found me. It was supposed to be a Skype call but I decided that wasnapost going to work so abandoned it and called her from my bedroom instead. And she says tea time is by far the trickiest time to handle. The most dficult time of day is between pm and pm, she said. Everyone is so fed up and tired by then. We usually get a lot of tantrums and food thrown around. Iaposm usually ready to run out of the door by the time it hits pm. Iaposd be lyingI didnapost say I donapost look forward to bed time. I love them all to bits but it is hard work. Iaposve given up cleaning during the day as they just throw everything all over, Orla is at the stage where she pulls everything out of the kitchen cupboards. Thereaposs been a few boxes of cereals thrown all over the floor. By the time everyoneaposs gone to bed and weaposve cleaned up we are both exhausted. But not one to sit still, once the kids are in bed Rachael will find herself cracking on with jobs around the house and doing bits of work when she can. Above all, sheaposs grateful that they are safe and well, that her husband shares the workload and that they are finding joy in some of the simpler things in le. We have good and bad days, but generally they arenapost that bad, she said. I spent the first week of lockdown panicking that we wouldnapost be able to cope for weeks with everyone at home.  The first week was very stressful and this last week has but itaposs just finding new ways to entertain everyone, keep them all fed and watered. I decided to make the video then cried when I watched it back because it made me realise how lucky I am. My kids might drive me crazy at times but theyaposre gorgeous and they do generally get on very well. Itaposs dficult juggling everything but we need to appreciate the little things. We are lucky we are all still here and we will not get this time back again. Weaposve been doing a weekly pub quiz with my family via Zoom. It was really nice to do something dferent.

The mysterious vessels, which are waiting to dock at Port Talbot, appeared several days ago and have fuelled re speculation on social media over why they are there, Wales Online reports. Among the theories put forward by residents are that the ships might be carrying reinforcement supplies of items such as toilet roll, which have been bought up by coronavirus panic-buying. Others have suggested that their sudden appearance might be connected to Mondayaposs historic drop in oil prices. The ships are currently anchoring in the Bristol Channel, off the coast of Gower. Curious locals have been taking to Facebook to shed light on what they might be, with some speculating that they could be cruise liners or car carriers. One user commented: Anyone know what ship boat is in the bay this morning  Looks like a cruise ship. Another replied: If it’s the right one I believe it’s a car carrier! Posting on Twitter, another said: The shortage of toilet rolls finally resolved as six ships anchor in the Bristol channel waiting to enter Port Talbot docks. Although it is not clear what cargo the ships are carrying, one of the vessels is registered as an oil tanker. The most eye-catching and weird-looking vessel was the first one that arrived at the weekend.  The -metre long flat-sided vehicle carrier, Mediterranean Highway, is registered in Panama and weighs over , tonnes. The other ships are Whitstar , Golden Eagle , Sagar Samrat , Bulk Enduranceand SSI Excellent . It is not clear how long the ships, which y inbetween  and  metres, will be anchored in the Bristol Channel.

Ministers misleading people is wrong in principle and risks undermining widespread public consent for the lockdownmillions refuse to believe what they’re told. On PPE and testing, the Government has clearly failed, excuses no longer acceptable. Those responsible must be held to accountpeople are dying needlessly. Payback time OTHER insurance firms and suppliers charging for services we cannot use in the lockdown should follow the lead of Admiral, which is refunding £ to motorists. Some will understandably argue the repayment should to be much higher when many roads are virtually empty. But a money-back principle is established, which many firms will be under pressure to match or beat during an extraordinary period in our nation’s history. Deferring premiums from those struggling to pay is welcome too but those firms must also consider reducing and ing policy fees.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund.

Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted.

season in the lower isions and dish out much-needed prize money.That was after the American’s initially-intended “no” vote changed to a “yes” to allow the resolution to pass in exchange for firm promises on league reconstruction five days later.That sparked an outcry from the club’s fans over the U-turn which saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners.And the Dundee Supporters Association – which is made up of  clubs comprising , members – sent an email to the Dens supremo asking for “clarity” over the change in position and how it would benefit the Dark Blues.Nelms responded with a club statement to reiterate he “got the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration proposed” and followed that up with a phone conversation with DSA chairman Kenny Ross.The DSA committee then released a statement stating they were pleased that the push for league reconstruction shows Nelms and owner Tim Keyes “are in this for the long haul”.The statement included: “We were pleased that the club not only released an updated statement later that day but that managing director John Nelms also personally contacted a member of the DSA committee by phone.“Mr Nelms was more than able to adequately explain the club’s thought processes and position and demonstrate how he was able to get the best possible outcome for Dundee Football Club in an impossible situation.“When Dundee realised their vote hadn’t been cast on April , the dynamic changed and it is clear to the DSA that Mr Nelms has worked tirelessly since and as a result of the SPFL releasing the results of the ballot before all of the member votes were in, was put in an unfair, undemocratic and dficult position.“With regards to league reconstruction we suspect that none of the  SPFL chairmanpushed harder for it than John Nelms and, as a result, a working party has been established to discuss it, which was not on the table in the original resolution.“It would not have been convened had Dundee voted ‘No’ as they had originally intended and this has to be a good thing and in the best interests of Dundee FC.“We were therefore pleased to learn that John himself will be on that working group and gives proof,any were needed that John and Tim Keyes are in this for the long haul.“The DSA are therefore happy and satisfied that Mr Nelms worked in best interests of both Dundee FC and Scottish football in general and got the best possible outcome for our club in a very dficult situation.“The Dundee FC Supporters Association has had a good working relationship with Mr Nelms and his board in recent years and we are grateful that he responded to our request swtly and satisfactorily and look forward to this relationship continuing in the future.”EXCLUSIVE: John Nelms answers fan worries saying #yes# vote got best possible deal for Dundee\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp exclusive-dundee-fans-want-answers-from-john-nelms-over-vote-u-turn embed # secretVsoNNDXU\" data-secret\"VsoNNDXU\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/collage-e1587566304794-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united reconstruction spfl","story":"It’s great to see talks have already begun over league reconstruction and I’m glad they will be speedy ones – getting all this mess behind us will be for the better.Even a global pandemic can’t stop the drama that continually surrounds Scottish football.This past couple of weeks have taken the biscuit, though.I read Ann Budge’s comments recently about getting the plans in place as soon as possible and, for me, that’s the right idea.The quicker we get things sorted the better for everyone – clubs can plan ahead for whatever ision they will be in and there will, at last, be some clarity over what the future holds.Evenwe don’t know when the game will .I suggested a few weeks back that revamping our set-up to include  teams in the top flight would be a way to stop anyone being unfairly damaged by the coronavirus shutdown.I stand by that. In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water.

But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance.

Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice. If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield. This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people. Yes, the tasting pack will be part of the discussion, but there will be plenty of people around the world who have bottles of Adelphi open ndash or any whisky for that matter ndash and we want them to join us.ldquoAlex, Arthur and myself will be just having a general chat about whisky ndash yes, the focus will be on our whiskies ndash but we want to invite anyone whorsquos a fan to open a bottle and join us.So, to the critical question ndash whatrsquos going to be on show  Irsquom speaking to Mackenzie by phone, but I can almost see the glint of excitement in his eyes. ldquoWersquore pretty pleased with this list ndash and we hope the people who join us will be too hellipSo here are the drams:bull Ardnamurchan   Year Old Single Cask .% not- this is a bottling from Adelphirsquos own distillery, and the first taste of the actual whisky ahead of an release hopefully later this year.bull The Glover  Year Old Batch  .% not- a special mix of Ardnamurchan and whisky from the legendary Chichibu Distillery in Japan.bull Linkwood   Year Old Single Cask .%bull Caol Ila   Year Old Single Cask .%And just for a special treat:bull Bas Armagnac   Year Old Armagnac Single Cask .%So, how can I get involved, I ask Connal. ldquoWell, he said, ldquoeven though all our tasting packs have sold out, donrsquot let that bother you.

Facts, being statements of truth about particular moments in time, can change ndash like the way doctors ask people with concussion who the Prime Minister is at the moment. OK, maybe thatrsquos a bad example. But we usually think of a fact as an objective, unchanging truth.What does change, however, is information, or understanding. Itrsquos perfectly likely, indeed, almost a certainty, that the authorities made mistakes in their initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Thatrsquos probably true whether wersquore talking about the UK Government, or its scientic advisors, or Public Health England, or Health Protection Scotland, or their equivalents in the dozens of other countries dealing with this emergency.By definition, some countries and health systems will have done better than others. Establishing which measures have been most effective in curtailing the spread of the disease is a matter, not merely of interest, but of vital importance in enabling us to contain and manage the crisis. The role of trusted media in asking such questions has seldom been so important, evenit has seldom been so dficult.It is dficult not merely because epidemics, and their occurrence, severity and distribution involves complex microbiology and statistical analysis: a surprising number of people on social mediawill assure you that they are much better informed on those subjects than world-renowned scientists. Thatrsquos one reason why traditional, rigorously fact-checked, reporting from established sources is crucial.But it is problematic, too, because to put it bluntly, there is no other story apart from this one and, consequently, there is a constant search for answers that are not going to be available for some time. If you doubt this, consider another major global health emergency: HIV was identied in  and although our understanding of it, and ability to treat its effects, is now fairly good, there is still no vaccine, despite the fact that we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on research.It is reasonable ndash essential ndash to ask questions such as: does wearing a mask do much in the way of preventing the spread of disease  Or,you have recovered from coronavirus, do you have a degree of immunity  Andso, for how long  But unfortunately, the answers may not be forthcoming, and you may get dferent ones depending on who you ask. Science has ndash as with smallpox or cholera ndash triumphantly produced answers to such questions, but does not iniably do so, and usually not quickly, or without a great deal of careful analysis and discarded theories.Itrsquos therefore ndash at least apparently ndash easier to ask questions about policy. Whether the Government has bungled its response, whether it could have held meetings a few days earlier, and whether it ought to have funded programmes dferently these are all the kinds of things that seem to be news, fruitful avenues of inquiry, and where we might get some kind of definitive answer. And no doubt, in the long run, we shall.There are, however, plenty of reasons to be cautious about rushing to judgment even on those questions, and for examining our motives and conclusions carefully. It would be bizarre, for example, to argue that the UK Government response has been shoddy, while approving of the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach, since it would be dficult to put a cigarette paper between the two. And while itrsquos worth noting that Irelandrsquos statistics look much better than the UKrsquos, that canrsquot be entirely because of policy, since Northern Ireland has the same guidelines as the mainland, and so far a lower rate of infection than the Republic.There will inevitably have been errors in strategy and deficiencies in the approach of almost everyone in dealing with this pandemic. Itrsquos important that, over time, these are scrutinised and lessons are learned from them. But we need to resist any temptation to make them the basis for partisan point-scoring.If the UK Government has got things wrong , then it will hardly be alone. And the questions that arise will need to be directed not just at politicians, but to the scientic advisors and public bodies that have directed their approach.Like almost everyone , I think it likely that, for example, Donald Trumprsquos seat-of-the-pants approach to this crisis will turn out to have made matters much worse for the United States than it might otherwise have been. But evenI think the Presidentrsquos an idiot, that may not be the salient factor.It could be that terrible figures from New York may be primarily to do with the fact that it has, after London, the worldrsquos second biggest transit airport. Similarly, only time will tell whether Swedenrsquos approach ndash not imposing a lockdown at all ndash works andwhether that tells us anything about the disease, or only about the demographics of Sweden.In the face of a terrying pandemic that strikes with random and unpredictable force, wersquove all come to realise that only by constantly testing and challenging our responses and prejudices ndash medical, scientic and political ndash will we get through.

Our assumptions about what is lsquonormalrsquo in our daily lives have fundamentally changed. Many of our personal, family, community and organisational routines have been dramatically altered to help us get through this emergency.As we make this community effort, there is one old assumption which we must absolutely notto. This is the long-held and outdated thought that looking after the environment is in conflict with economic success.Scotland has already made strong progress in discarding this old mindset with a track record, for example, in reducing carbon emissions by creating the new industries of tomorrow such as renewable energy. Scotland, along with Iceland and New Zealand, established the Wellbeing Economy Governments Initiative in . It is these types of innovation that will help us createvibrant economies that will serve our human needs and are in sync with what our one and only earth can provide.Long-term visionAs Scotlandrsquos environmental watchdog, we have kept this long-term vision in mind as we work out how to play our own specic role in the national effort to tackle the current public health emergency.We have set our aim as making our ldquobest contribution to helping the nation get through this public health emergency in a way that protects and improves Scotlandrsquos environment.What does this mean for how we do our job  The Scottish Government has designated  critical national infrastructure sectors vital to the ing of society during this emergency. At SEPA,we regulate the environmental impact of many of these sectors. We are working closely with these sectors tohelp this national focus on food security, the provision of clean water and the maintenance of critical infrastructure and the support services on which we all rely.We know that all businesses we regulate are trying to operate in extraordinary circumstances. We know they are trying to look after the health of their own workforces. We know they may have supply-chain and other challenges.On th April, we published our regulatory philosophy for this next period, a new Coronavirus website, information and a series of lsquoregulatory positionsrsquo which support specic sectors over the period ahead. Wersquoll add more over the coming weeks.Do the right thingWe said thatwhereregulatedbusinesses are unable to fully meet their compliance obligations, they should prioritise conditions which directly protect the environment over those of an administrative nature. They should contact SEPA, work closely with us and document the choices and actions they take.WersquoveaskedScottish businesses to adapt responsibly and we expect the majority will. Ourmessagehas beenclear:you try to do the right thing in this next period, you will find a helpful and supportive regulator. If you deliberately do the wrong thing while the rest of Scottish society pulls together, yoursquoll get the uncompromising regulator your behaviour deserves.This approachof supporting progressive business behaviour and punishing poor business behaviourhas been central to our regulatory strategy: One Planet Prosperity. The challenge of how we help Scottish businesses and communities thrive within the resources that our one planet provides is more important now than ever.THATrsquoS THE SPIRIT: The North British Distillery, is among a group of drinks companies who are supplying high strength alcohol for hand sanitisers.InnovationIn the current period, wersquore alllooking at how companies are responding. Wersquore seeing the very best in innovation, as companies such as North British Distillery in Edinburgh are supplying high strength alcohol to produce hand sanitiser. International spirits firm Edrington, behind names like The Macallan, Highland Park, The Glenrothes and The Famous Grouseblended Scotch is supporting Glasgow City Councilrsquos production of sanitiser for care homes and front-line staff, such as waste and recycling workers, through ongoing donations of high strength alcohol from North British.Last week Edrington also donated hand sanitiser to The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre.Similar to most Scottish employers still able to operate, we have had to adapt in order to protect our workforce and help reduce the spread of the virus. We will continue to use a iety of means of checking and assessing compliance, including phone calls, issuing written advice, remotely managed technologies such as drones, targeted site and field visits, and other forms of intelligence gathering.Even some businesses which, unfortunately, have had to, or are considering, pausing production are already opening discussions with us about how they might reduce environmental impact when they restart their economic activity.People, planet and profitIn ,business sustainability leader John Elkingtoncoined the phrase thelsquotriple bottom linersquo of people, planet and profit. Despite it entering the business lexicon, twenty-five years later Elkington wrote an article in Hard Business Review announcing a lsquoproduct recallrsquo of his triple bottom line concept.The concept had become popular. It had helped bring environmental and social issues into boardroom deliberations. It sparked a series of actions by many businesses to improve their environmental performance and contribute to enhanced social outcomes.Elkington had hoped it would help fundamentally change our economies. It helped us step forward, but not jump ahead. It led to improvements, but not transformation. Elkington had that rare vision to call time on an idea that had been successful, but needed replacing by something new.Last year, Elkington and his team at Volans launched its lsquoTomorrowrsquos Capitalismrsquo inquiry. Alongside global companies such as Unilever, Aviva Investors, Covestro and The Body Shop, SEPA is participating as the only regulatory agency invited to join the project. We are bringing some of Scotlandrsquos innovation into the project and learning with others as we debate and, importantly, test practical ways of creating the future economy and society that will serve us all well.Last week, the Scottish Government announced an Economic Recovery Action Group. In doing so, the First Minster said ldquoits role will be to advise government on actions to support economic recovery. And crucially it will consider how these actions can contribute to our aim ofbuildinga fairer, and a greener, and a more equal society as well. SEPA will contribute our ideas from our One Planet Prosperity work with our partners in Scotland and from our participation in Volansrsquo Tomorrowrsquos Capitalism inquiry.As we take a moment to reflecton this th Earth Day,itrsquosclear that the next periodcanrsquot be an alibi for inaction. The future is not what it was going to be. As Scotlandrsquos environmental regulator, we will maintain our twin focus: regulating in a way that helps Scotland get through this public health emergency and regulating in a way that helps builds an even better, more inclusive and sustainable Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"matt-hancock-uk-agreed-take-part-eu-ppe-scheme-far-no-equipment-delivered","story":"Amid the continuing concerns over the availability of Personal Protective Equipment, the UK Health Secretary made his remarks after a Whitehall mandarin shocked MPs by saying the UK Governmentrsquos decision not to take part in anEU ventilator scheme was a ldquopolitical one.Sir Simon McDonald, the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, told a virtual session of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, that officials had briefed ministers on what continental procurment schemes were still open to the UK, even though it had left the European Union at the end of January.:FMQs as it happened: Nicola Sturgeon quizzed over Scotlands Covid- responseAsked why the UK was not involved in EU procurement, Sir Simon replied: \"We left the European Union on January .\"Pressed by Labour MP Chris Bryant, who argued the UK had \"every right\" to participate in the scheme, the chief official said: \"All I can say is, as a matter of fact, we have not taken part.\"When Tom Tugendhat, the committee Chairman, asked Sir Simon whether it had been a political decision by ministers, he replied: \"It was a political decision.\"British officials at the UK Mission to the EU in Brussels \"briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is no,\" explained Sir Simon.However, last night in a dramatic twist, the Whitehall mandarin wrote to the committeeto say he had been \"incorrect\" and reverted to the Governments earlier defence that the EU scheme was not initially joined because of a \"communication problem\".Sir Simon saidhe wanted to \"clary\" that point which he had called \"incorrect\".He explained that \"due to a misunderstanding\" he had \"inadvertently and wrongly\" made the claim.\"Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate,\" he wrote.As the political row over the EU procurement scheme took off in the wake of Brexit, Downing Street last month claimed there had been a \"mix-up,\" which had meant emails from the EU about the procurement scheme were not received.Sir Simonrsquos initial remarks were seized upon by opposition politicians, whodemanded answers.Alyn Smith, the SNPrsquos foreign affairs spokesman, said the claim that the Conservative Governmentrsquos decision was a political decision rather than a logistical error was ldquodamning.:Couple die within a day of each other after contracting coronavirusThe Stirling MP declared: ldquoItrsquos clear UK Government ministers were briefed about the Europe-wide scheme but chose to reject vital protective equipment due to its narrow Brexit ideology.Sir Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"This Governments evident unwillingness to work with the European Union through the current crisis is unforgivable.\"Time and again, the Government seem to have missed opportunities to join the EUs procurement efforts. Continued shortages of PPE over the last few days coupled with the Governments failure to scale up testing for NHS and social care workers demonstrate that the current approach hasnt delivered. Lives are at risk as a result.Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, noted: \"First, we were told the Government missed an email invitation to join the EU procurement scheme.

Itrsquos time for Westminster to wake up to the huge potential that these changes unleash and commit to reforming the Commons for good, she added.As a small number of MPs debated the motion the chamber had black and yellow taping on the floor and seats were marked with a no-entry sign or a tick to show where they could sit, ensuring they kept to the two-metre social distancing rule.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, told MPs said the new digital Parliament might not be perfect and technical glitches were likely to occur but he insisted: ldquoWe must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\"Mr Rees-Mogg explained that he expected to bring forward further motions shortly so MPs could extend the virtual ways of working for a longer period and to ldquomore substantive business including legislation.Karen Bradley, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, pointed out it had not looked thoroughly at remote voting, noting how ldquosome others have tried the trial run of it and cant say it was absolutely brilliant. A lot more work will need to be done\".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle pointed out no decision had yet been taken with regards to voting and that any considerations to do so would be ldquocompletely checked\" before being implemented.In exchanges, Labourrsquos John Spellar said the Commons had to be the \"epicentre of the democratic system\" and its role scaled-up in the coming weeks to ensure questions are answered by ministers, noting: \"Otherwise, what is the point of Parliament \"Tory backbencher Sir Desmond Swayne, commenting on the limiting of numbers in the chamber, claimed it would be \"outrageous\"MPs were excluded from debates.\"This is the precedent that were now setting and it would be outrageousmembers elected to this House were unable to come and bring their concerns to this chamber because there were already a sufficient number of members within it,\" he said.Meanwhile, the House of Lords held its first-ever virtual sitting.Instead of a packed chamber for question time, peers took part remotely from their homes by internet link.The historic change led to less rowdy exchanges as members were called inidually by the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, to speak rather than having to bob up and down in their seats in the House.Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rees-Mogg raised a smile among MPs when he joked: \"In , when the Black Death affected this country, Parliament couldnt sit and didnt the session was cancelled.ldquoThanks to modern technology, even I have moved on from  and Im glad to say that we can sit to carry out these fundamental constitutional s.

Its health service has been brought to its knees and the country remains under strict lockdown.So how can the Mafia thrive Rather than impinging their activities, lsquoLa Cosa Nostrarsquo - as the mob refers to itself - is defying lockdown and capitalising on the vulnerability of iniduals and businesses.In what ways Earlier this month, members held an elaborate funeral procession for a -year-old scion of one of Sicilys most renowned mob families, despite lockdown meaning funerals have been banned since early March. In the Sicilian district of Palermo, a local mob boss also organised a Good Friday church service, but it was ultimately halted by police.Making money Mafia clans are offering credit to firms on the brink, with anti-Mafia body, SOS Impresa, saying the virus has essentially transformed the mob into Italyrsquos largest bank, even buying shares in at-risk firms to offer apparent lsquolelinesrsquo that could soon be dead-weights.Targeting the vulnerable The Mafia provide necessities to poverty-stricken neighbourhoods - but these residents are then in the mobrsquos debt. Some debts are being repaid by those who find themselves newly unemployed agreeing to become foot-soldiers, boosting the Mafiarsquos numbers.Cleaning The mob has always invested in cleaning firms and delivery services and are now focusing on running funeral homes and hospital laundry services, two areas under severe pressure presently.Itrsquos always been this way On the island of Sicily, which was ruled by foreign invaders for centuries, islanders banded together to protect themselves and carry out their own brand of justice. In fact, the term rsquoMafioisorsquo - or lsquoMafia memberrsquo - originally had no criminal connotations, meaning only someone who was suspicious of authority.But by the mid-th century, the groups became private armies - lsquoMafiersquo - who extorted landowners and firms for protection money, evolving into the Sicilian Mafia as we know it today.The American mob A separate entity to the Sicilian Mafia, the US Mafia follows the same code of conduct, but is not faring so well. The cancellation of sporting events has wiped out millions of dollars in illegal gambling earnings, while other mafia mainstays, including extorting restaurants and construction rackets, have also ended, with eateries closed and building projects halted.Itrsquos just like the movies So many classic films feature the Mafia, from Francis Ford Coppolarsquos The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando, to Martin Scorsesersquos Goodfellas. But even Goodfellas was based in reality - inspired by the non-fiction book, Wiseguy, about mobster-turned-informant, Henry Hill.Tony Soprano The late James Gandolfini memorably played New Jersey mob boss Tony on iconic TV show, The Sopranos.

In the case of Covid-,one country is a pandemic hotspot, wersquore all at risk of reinfection.The ScotsmanScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hoped the reconvening of the Scottish Parliament - obeying social distancing rules - would lsquousher in a new phase of heightened accountability and greater openness.rsquoHe said the national emergency was lsquoall the more reason for an intensication rather than a dilution of parliamentary scrutiny.rsquoldquoThat means members of the Scottish Parliament from all parties should have access to fully question Government ministers who are running the country during these most extraordinary of times, he said. ldquoEverywhere around there is mounting pressure to restart the economy. For me the choice is clear. Put simply, peoplersquos lives and well-being must be placed ahead of business considerations.He said those putting themselves most at risk during the pandemic - those working in care, for example, and stacking shelves supermarkets - are already those on lower wages, even zero hours contracts.ldquoSo the parliamentary scrutiny which we now need is about ensuring that the real-lived experiences of people have an influential bearing on the decisions made by both governments, he argued. ldquoIt is about ensuring that the maximum level of income support goes to those who need it. But it is also about the ethics of how we treat our elderly and infirm in the face of this pandemic. Everyone must have an equal right of access to treatment, dignity and respect and so the chance of le itself.The Stephen Pollard admitted there lsquowasnrsquot much to cheer about at the momentrsquo but, at a time when anyone over  is deemed especially vulnerable, he said, there was a lsquowonderful irony that the two people who have done most to bring us together are both in their s.rsquoldquoCaptain Tom Moore, the war veteran who captivated the nation over the weekend with his fund-raising walk for the NHS, is a scarcely believable , he said ldquoBut when it comes to the scarcely believable, nothing comes close to the fact that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is  today.Just over two weeks ago she spoke to the nation - and the world - about the pandemic.ldquoThere is no one  on the planet who could have talked as she did, with the history she has lived through and been part of, and with the respect she has earned from a le devoted to service and duty, he said. ldquoWe are so lucky to have her and all the more so at a time of national crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-now-vital-government-goes-way","story":"The UK did not start its present lockdown until March . Up until then, the UK Government had given out very mixed messages. It allowed international sports fixtures to go ahead, allowing , fans from virus-hit Madrid to come to watch Liverpool play on March . It allowed racingrsquos Cheltenham Festival to go ahead from March -. It stopped contact tracing on March  with no apparent strategy to replace it.Between March  and , the hospital death rates were doubling every two-to three days. On March , Boris Johnson gave a speech which advised people to socially distance and not go to pubs and restaurants. Schools remained open. Although a section of the community took this advice, public transport was still very crowded, people were still going out, and on the following weekend, we saw thousands of people flocking to beauty spots across the country. Obviously the message that Mr Johnson had given was not understood and did not have the intended effect and transmission was still occurring to a great extent.Finally, on March , the present lockdown was announced. If this had been done a week previously, as in Germany, Austria and other places, our death and infection rates would be up to a quarter of those at present. With a doubling rate of three days, simple mathematics shows that in a week, the infections will quadruple. If the present lockdown had been announced a week earlier, a lot of our present problems would not be as great. There would be less need for PPE, intensive care beds and mortuaries. The lockdown would not be required as long as the virus would not have infected as much of the community. The economy would perhaps be less affected.A few weeks ago Professor Jason Leitch was talking about achieving herd immunity in an interview on BBC Scotland. Todayit has been reported that the WHO estimates only two to three per cent of the population is infected. It has also been suggested that having had Covid- does not guarantee immunity. This should hopefully stop any suggestion that we should allow successive waves of infection until we build up herd immunity.The Scottish Government needs to organise testing in the community and contact tracing so that we can ease the lockdown and keep the virus under control. The suggestion that this could start off in the more easily-isolated areas of the country seems a good idea. The Scottish Government should not be waiting for a ided, leaderless UK Government Cabinet to make a decision.Rob Evans, Dundee DD.IT is vital that the Scottish Government follows the advice from Neil Mackay. Health issues are devolved to the Scottish Government andNicola Sturgeon is unable to draw up regulations appropriate for the conditions which pertain in Scotland then that does call into question how Scotland could operate as an independent country. The Scottish Government must show that it is capable of governing the country in a distinct and appropriate manner.The regulations in all four home countries appear to have been cut and pasted from the same source. As an initial response that was quite acceptable, especiallythe source document has originally come from the World Health Organisation or the regulations imposed in another European country. However, now that the regulations have been in force for a month the four home countries need to develop their own regulations. The lower population density in Scotland presents both opportunities and challenges. The easy option is to follow Boris Johnson and then claim a big boy did it and ran away.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay has deemed Boris Johnsonrsquos approach to the coronavirus pandemic as a ldquodisaster and has urged Nicola Sturgeon to ldquobreak away. Ms Sturgeon has been at pains to stay more or less aligned to the Westminster approach, so far, which is to her credit, but deviation can only be sensiblethe course ahead is definite.All politicians will make mistakes over this new and uncharted coronavirus outbreak, it is inevitable, and sadly lives are always subject to such political judgments. At this stage no one can be sure about most of the answers but what is terribly obvious is that this whole episode has exposed the fragilities of Scottish independence. Just look at the oil price situation for example, hence Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire not to be out on a limb for fear of it breaking, and rightly so. It will not please some nationalists but we are definitely better together at this point in time and our First Minister seems to be aware of this fact.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IT is almost impossible to try to make sense of Neil Mackayrsquos article in a non-political perspective. First, no one can at this stage know what the result of the UK Government strategy will be. His criticism based on personalities is hardly factual. The main thrust of his argument that the Scottish Government should take a dferent approach is confusing, as there has been nothing to stop it doing so up to now presumably it believes the UKrsquos approach to be correct. Mr Mackay now needs to inform us in detail what detailed steps we should take in Scotland that are dferent.Colin McKay, Newton Stewart.THE UK Government has been on the receiving end of criticism from people and organisations across the political spectrum for its handling of some of the UK manestations of the Covid- pandemic.In particular, when the decision was announced in the last week or so in March, that the country would enter a period of lockdown which brought the economic le of the country to a juddering halt, there was comment that this action should have been taken seven,  or even more days earlier, and perhaps it should have. However, I wonderthe decision to postpone the onset of lockdown was made for very pragmatic reasons.Scroll back six or seven weeks or so, and we were being regaled on an almost daily basis in both print and broadcast media of y queues of people with trolleys waiting for supermarkets to open, and some time later, leaving these emporiums with trolleys stacked high with toilet rolls, kitchen paper, rice, pasta, part-baked bread rolls and other non-perishable goods, stripping the shelves bare in the process.Despite repeated pleas from civic, political and religious leaders, and the supermarket chains themselves, this activity continued for many days. I would imagine that, when introducing a new policy, particularly one which imposes considerable new restrictions, ministers and their advisors would consider what would be the likelihood of the target population co-operating with these new impositions, andimprobable, what scale of resources and expenditure would be required to compel and maintain their compliance.Given the response to the appeal for shoppers to revert to the pattern of purchasing that they had found perfectly adequate in the last week of January, the Government probably felt that it would have little chance of persuading the general population to accept much more drastic restrictions, at least until it had been persistently exposed to the carnage taking place in Italy and Spain. Even then, there were a signicant number of so-called Covidiots who seemed intent on defying any attempt to curb their liberty.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THE language of war and battles to fight the coronavirus must stop.Language is a powerful tool. It can be used to both praise and demonise but either way it has an effect of on people, their wellbeing, their mental health. However, just as important as the adverse or positive effect that language can have on us as iniduals, words are also capable of shaping the public narrative to convince us what to think. Using war language to fight a health crisis is not helpful for at least three main reasons.The first is that it undermines legitimate challenge which, when it is absent, encourages systemic negligence to run rampantly unchecked.Secondly, it lulls us to uncritically accept the inevitability of thousands upon thousands of deaths, especially enabling the expendability of the costly, most vulnerable people in our society.Thirdly, war language demands sacrice and a culture of silence. This expectation is unnecessary, unwanted, and unhelpful it is anti-democratic and smacks of political expediency.All of these impacts are worrying and serves only as power and compliance tools for our political governors. Frontliners are workers, consistently undervalued ones, granted, but they are not warriors and they deserve the best protection. In light of this, more, many more questions need to be asked and answered.Why were we not prepared for this  Why are so many people dying compared to countries like Germany  Why are so many people dying in our care homes  Why are we demanding that our friends and family work on the frontline without full and proper protection for themselves and their patients  Why is there no urgency or recognition of the need to test and track Finally, in this modern Scotland, is it too much to ask to be treated like adults and receive honest answers in this bumbling, post-truth political world Councillor Brian McGinley , Ayr.I AM one of those people who go out every Thursday at pm to say thank you to all those dedicated people who are putting their lives and those of their families at risk to save others. I am, however, disappointed that the only references made regarding the Police Service are of issuing fines and heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the public in these dficult times.Their job is dficult enough and there is always a fine balance between discretion and enforcement. So on Thursday I will be including the police in my tribute to the emergency services.Neil Stewart, Balfron.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

The Good Morning Britain host was trashed for his criticism of Professor Jason Leitch, when the National Clinical Directorrefused to accept mass quarantining was the answer. ldquoListen to the expert! yelled Professor Leitch.Well, we did, and then we heard him say: ldquoWe have absolutely adequate levels of testing in Scotland. We heard his arguments for not testing: ldquoWersquore having to delay the spread of the virus. And, unbelievably, we heard him argue against social distancing: ldquoYou canrsquot keep m people six feet apart.We needed Morganrsquos questions at the time and we needed him again to kick hard at the shins of his Good Morning Britain colleague Dr Hilary after the telly doc backed the UK Governmentrsquos case for not yet closing the schools. Morgan raged again at the Government line, attacking Cabinet Minister Simon Clarke over \"shameful\" handling of PPE and him ldquonot having a clue how many health care staff had died. And during an interview with English culture secretary Oliver Dowden, Morganrsquos blood boiled at the insanity of allowing the Cheltenham Festival and the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid match to go ahead.But Morgan has shown added value this week on CNN, lambasting the morally bankrupt flibbertigibbet that is Boris Johnson and the asinine Donald Trump. . ldquoIrsquove been watching these daily briefings with mounting horror and, at almost every level, Donald Trump is failing the American people, with his self-aggrandising, self-justying rants.Morgan added: ldquoTo him, itrsquos more important he win the election in November.

Trumprsquos following, thankfully, has dropped six points.Now, Morgan isnrsquot clairvoyant and he certainly doesnrsquot always get the argument right.This week he attacked Dr Andrew Lilico, after the economist had criticised the NHS, leaping onto easy argument like John Wayne on a small horse, off to kill some Injuns.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

MPs are being encouraged to work virtually, especially as any MP in the Chamber will be treated the same as one appearing virtually and would only be called to speaklisted.The step towards a ‘hybrid’ House was taken by the House of Commons Commission in a bid to keep democracy going during the coronavirus crisis.The historic measures will still need the approval of MPs when theyfrom Easter recess on April .The hybrid model was developed at speed and chosen as an achievable first step towards a virtual Parliament – having the benefit of meeting current technological capacity.Orkney and Shetland MP, Alistair Carmichael said: “A hybrid parliament like this is better than no parliament at all. This can only be an interim measure however, on the way to a wholly virtual parliament.“I will keep working with the government and all parties to ensure that all parts of the United Kingdom are given a voice and that all political views are heard.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But it is far, far higher than where it needs to be, though we are at a peak.ldquoWe have high confidence that we are at a peak in this disease, but obviously we need to see that come down.

But the first step that wersquore taking is to send the message loud and clear to people who have suspected conditions that they should come forward.ldquoIf you think you might have a lump that might be a cancer, then you should come forward now, and you will be safely and properly treated in the NHS.ldquoThe same goesyou have a suspected heart attack or stroke ndash we have the systems in place to make sure thatyou come to the NHS, you will be looked after and protected.He said the Government was working to ldquogradually reopen the rest of the NHS to other procedures, including non le-threatening, planned surgery.The Government was also looking at why the death rate as a proportion of the population is lower in Germany than in the UK ldquoas we try to learn, he said.It comes after Dominic Raab faced a grilling in his Prime Ministerrsquos Questions clash with Sir Keir Starmer.The new Labour leader and Foreign Secretary Mr Raab ndash deputising for Boris Johnson as the Prime Minister continued his recovery from Covid- ndash faced each other in a sparsely attended House of Commons.Sir Keir questioned the Governmentrsquos progress towards its target of , tests a day by the end of the month and claimed that opportunities to acquire personal protective equipmentfrom British firms had been missed.He said: ldquoThere is a pattern emerging here. We were slow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment and now slow to take up these offers from British firms.Mr Raab told him the Government was guided by scientic advisers.He said thatSir Keir ldquothinks he knows better than they do, with the benefit of hindsight, then thatrsquos his decision.Mr Raab said ,British businesses had responded to a call for assistance on PPE and they had all received a response, with , followed up where it was ldquosensiblethey had equipment with the required specication and volume.He said it was an ldquoincredibly dficult and competitive international environment to source PPE from overseas.Mr Johnson continues to recover from coronavirus at Chequers and Mr Raab said the Prime Minister was in ldquogood spirits.In other developments, an RAF plane landed at Brize Norton from Turkey in the early hours of Wednesday, after being sent to collect a shipment of PPE.The Government also continues to face questions about its participation in EU schemes to secure vital equipment, with Brussels saying there had been ldquoample opportunity for the UK to join in.copy -.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

The weekly classes by Helen McConnell, aimed at children aged between six and , teach skills on how to cope with missing friends, grandparents, boredom and being confined for long periods at home.Just six months after she launched her meditation classes at North Star Health and Wellbeing Centre in Eglinton and in some schools, Ms McConnell was forced to rethink how best to reach the children taking part.She contacted parents about online classes, which are now proving to be very popular.Normally classes last an hour but these online classes are just half-an-hour long, which we are finding are working well, Ms McConnell said.The classes are for children from primary two to around  or  and I try and tailor them to the issues they are going through right now because of the coronavirus.As the classes are done through Zoom, the parents can participate along with the children, because a relaxed mum is a relaxed child.Ms McConnell explained how they take a dferent theme each week.She added: This week for example we are dealing with sleep, which parents are telling me is a big issue for their children at this particular time.Children are away from their school friends, their home friends, their grandparents, and that is dficult for them, so I teach meditation on how to cope with that.This is a time of great uncertainty, so I teach children to meditate on what they can control and how to deal with what they can#t control.One of their favourites is the #magic carpet ride#, which helps children deal with boredom. Even though we are restricted in where we can go in our everyday le right now, in our imagination we are free to go wherever we like. While delivering her meditation classes online is an unusual way to teach children, Ms McConnell has been pleased at how well the youngsters are adapting.She added: Since I started this I haven#t had one single child who said they didn#t like it, even those who started the class because it was their parents who wanted them to do it. Children are really receptive to meditation, more so even than most adults would be.So it is wonderful to be able to help them cope with this very stressful time.More information can be found on the Facebook page Children#s Well-being with HelenBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was just asI had played in an intense match. I thought that it would be best then that I didn#t go to work, and I later developed a high temperature and a small cough.But I do really feel a lot better now. I still have not got my full sense of taste back, but other than that I feel good. I am back at work, thankfully.The morale within Cavan General Hospital is so good that it has actually helped my recovery. Everyone is very positive despite the pressures that they are under. I have taken my inspiration from others who are proving wonderful colleagues in dficult circumstances.Having transferred from the Carrickcruppen club in Armagh to Cavan side Lacken, she is looking forward to resuming playing, having already brought the curtain down on her inter-county career.Marian, who won an Ulster Senior Championship medal with Armagh in , is particularly keen to engage in collective training once again.Yes, it will be a change for me to be training with Lacken, but I am looking forward to it immensely.

The -year-old also said she definitely doesn#t understand how off-licences can be open and cemeteries closed.I#m very sad I can#t go and visit my mum, she said.

He was pretty unresponsive. I#ve never seen someone look so ill. It was shocking.For more than a week he was pretty much asleep. At least at the end he was in peace and he wasn#t in pain any more.Oliver#s death represents more heartache for the family at this dficult time because they must say goodbye amid the stringent restrictions that have been imposed as a result of the killer virus.But Julie said that organising his funeral has helped her better understand why a decision to close cemeteries may have been taken, even though she does not agree with it.Read More Coronavirus: It#s cruel to keep graveyards closed, says minister Edwin PootsI can see both sides of the argument because of the position we#re in, she added. We#re having a graveside service on Friday and only  of us are allowed to be there. But I can imagine maybecemeteries were open there would be a risk of more people trying to attend services, but at the end of the day it#s up to people as to how they want to behave.I think politicians need to trust the public more. They should change this policy and allow grieving families to visit their loved ones# final resting places.For me it all comes back to the same question:alcohol shops are open, why aren#t cemeteries She added: I can see both sides but I don#t really understand what harm could be caused by having cemeteries open. Carnmoney is so big and on the very rare occasion that I saw someone  there they were a huge distance away.Julie told how Oliver#s we - and her grandmother - Elizabeth, who was known as Lillian, died suddenly from a heart attack in  and she said she would take great comfort from being able to say a final farewell to her grandad at the graveside this weekend.And she said her family#s proximity to his final place of rest will be all the more poignant given the tragic run up to his recent passing in the early hours of Saturday morning.I think grandad contracted the virus about  days before his death, Julie said.We were just lucky that his room was on the ground floor because that meant that when he was extremely ill me and dad could look in through the window and see him. If he had been upstairs we wouldn#t have been able to. The care assistants were telling him who we were, but I#m not sure he recognised us.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those workers are based in the Northern sector which takes in Derry, Strabane and Limavady. It comes after the Derry News revealed earlier this month that  workers were off across the Trust area because of COVID- - the illness that can affect your lungs and airways which is caused by coronavirus. Of those employees,  worked at Altnagelvin Hospital. There was a relatively even split between the numbers self-isolating due to symptoms of their own and those isolating because family members had symptoms. googletag.cmd.push Testing has been ramped up in dferent parts of NI, including Derry where a facility has just opened at City of Derry Rugby Club, to ensure that health and social care staff are kept safe. It is also hoped that testing will allow staff who are following government guidelines by isolating - but are not actually sick - toto work so they can assist during the first wave of coronavirus cases. However, according to the latest figures available  staff members are still absent. In a statement to the Derry News on Friday, a spokesperson for the Western Trust confirmed: “Whilst a number of staff have ed to work following a period of absence some staff have commenced new episodes of absence related to coronavirus. googletag.cmd.push “The total number of staff absent as at th April is . Since the introduction of testing on th March  and up to th April  a total of  Northern Sector staff have been tested – this covers both hospital and community staff.” Approximately , people responded to a workforce appeal by the Trust to allow it to cope with an increased demand on services in light of the coronavirus pandemic. That included retired doctors and student nurses who have joined the frontline. A quarter of those applicants have commenced work in a range of roles. A spokesperson explained. “The Trust recently launched a workforce appeal for staff and have appointed  staff to date. “The recruitment team is continuing to process a large number of applications.” Northern Ireland is nearing the end of what was described as the first wave of cases which was expected to peak between April -. Under this ‘reasonable worst case scenario’, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The latest Public Health Agencybulletin, as of April , reports  deaths. It is believed that this peak may be less severe than first anticipated but last Thursday saw the highest daily rise with  COVID related deaths in NI hospitals. That total was matched on Friday and a further  people tested positive, a development Health Minister Robin Swann described was a ‘wake up call’ as he warned against complacency. On Saturday a further  deaths were registered and one more person was added to the overall death toll on Sunday. TESTING Almost , people have been tested for COVID- in Northern Ireland - over , of them health care workers. The current target is set at over , tests per day with a view to scaling up over time and expanding priority groups. The test centre at City of Derry Rugby Club will assist with that upscaling. Criticism has been levelled at the government for limited testing in the community and contact tracing as that will be crucial when it comes to estimating population immunity and designing an exit strategy to move out of the current lockdown. Speaking last week Minister of Health Robin Swann said: “Testing of health care workers has been a key priority of mine and I am glad that in recent weeks we have tested over , of our frontline staff. “That’s important for them, and it’s also important for the people they support such as the residents in our care homes.” He continued: ”An expert working group has also been established to lead on the expansion of testing across all our laboratory services, both within Health and Social Care facilities, and also to consider options for the utilisation of other testing facilities including within the commercial sector. “There is a NI Testing Strategy that has already been shared with the Executive and the Health Committee. In that I have made it clear that the overall testing policy will be adjusted over time as testing capacity increases, and priority groups for testing are expanded. “Similarly the strategy also includes a pledge that testing will soon move towards surveillance of COVID- in the population to inform planning of services including surge capacity, and to estimate population immunity.“  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Yesterday, the Department for the Economy released a guide setting out principles and practical steps for employers and employees to keep themselves and their workplaces safe. It also highlights the steps to be followedemployers and employees are concerned about safety. In Derry a number of businesses remain operational at present offering delivery, collection and online services. Other independent businesses in the city are selling ‘no expiry date’ vouchers and fitness centres are streaming workouts via Zoom. googletag.cmd.push The workplace safety guidance published this week is accompanied by a list of priority business sectors. The sectors list aims to clary what constitutes a priority sector at this time and to support companies to continue their business operationsthey can work within social distancing guidelines. Sectors include manufacturing which takes in food and drink, businesses making PPE garments, newspaper printers, manufacturers of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, computer electronic components, cyber products and ‘products critical to local, national global supply chains that are responding to the COVID- crisis.’ Other sectors are mining and quarrying, distribution, financial and insurance, agriculture, forestry and fishery and construction - when it relates to emergency services and emergency repairs to homes. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, service industries include transport, food delivery and takeaway, services providing food and drink to those imprisoned or homeless, print and broadcast media, postal service, veterinary activities, dentistry, funeral directors and laundrettes. A cinema, theatre or concert Hall can broadcast a performance to people outside the premises over the internet, or on radio or televisionEconomy Minister Diane Dodds published the guidance on making workplaces safer and the list of priority sectors which were drawn up by the Engagement Forum. The Forum was set up by the Minister to advise the Executive on the list of priority businesses sectors referred to in the Health Protection Regulations. It was also asked to advise on measures required to protect the safety of all workers. The forum is chaired by the Labour Relations Agencyand consists of representatives from business organisations, trade unions, local councils, government, the Health and Safety Executive NI, Public Health Agency and Food Standards Agency. It drew up a list of priority business sectors and developed guidance on safe working practices during the current COVID- crisis. The Minister presented these to the Executive on Monday, which agreed to publish both papers. SUPPLY CHAINS Speaking this week the Minister said: “It was very important that so many organisations from across our economy were represented and it is reassuring that they are united in their determination to work together towards a common goal. “The list is published for advisory purposes to allow companies to make their own decisions. If a company can work within the social distancing guidelines then it should do so. “The safety guidance will have practical application in the workplace. “Along with the accompanying guidance on safe working practices, the list is there to protect everyone in the workplace, to ensure our essential supply chains remain solid and to help Northern Ireland be ready to rebuild its economy when this crisis has passed.” She went on to say that the aim of the priority sectors list, which is fully supported by both business and union representatives on the Forum, is to clary what constitutes a priority sector at this time, and to support Northern Ireland companies to continue their business operations and protect the incomes of their workforces. The accompanying workplace safety guidance – ‘COVID-: Working Through This Together, A Practical Guide to Making Workplaces Safer’ – has been developed and informed by professional advice from the HSE, PHA and the LRA as well as input from an employer and trade union perspective.

Dorothy Hamilton lives in Cookstown and receives support from the Mid Ulster Age Sector network set up by Age NI, who have an office in Magherafelt. “I feel like a prisoner in my own house, to tell you the truth,” said the -year-old. “I used to take the car to Tesco, and I looked forward to going to get groceries and all, but that’s out of the question now. It’s like being in the army, I believe, in Tesco now, it’s hard work. googletag.cmd.push The loneliness of the lockdown was brought into sharp focus for Dorothy last week when she celebrated her thbirthday at home. She said: “I had my birthday on Monday, and I was here on my own. I suppose people wanted to come round but they couldn’t come in. “It’s awful having to spend your birthday on your own with no visitors at all. It’s been three weeks or a month since I’ve been out, I’m fed up on my own in the house. “It’s a quiet place to live, but I didn’t realise it could be as quiet as it is now. All my friends have moved out to where. It’s dficult at times.” googletag.cmd.push When the lockdown was first announced, Dorothy did her best to make the most of the free time, but as time went on, it became more dficult. She said: “It’s been three weeks or a month since I’ve been out, I’m fed up on my own in the house. I try to keep dressed reasonably well asI’m going out somewhere. “I was grand at the start for ten days or so. I sat one day sewing and was quite content and it passed the afternoon for me, but you can only pass the time for so long and the rest of the time you don’t know what to do with yourself.” “With things the way they are, I must start and exercise, but I’m very sore. I sat one day sewing and was quite content and it passed the afternoon for me.” The former health service worker says the support she is getting from Mid Ulster Age Sector network, and in particular Linda and Raymond McGarvey, has been a real help. Dorothy says Linda is very strict, but she understands the need for the stringent measures and is aware of the danger the virus can pose. “Linda comes down and she’s really strict – she has gloves and the lot,” she said. “I’m looking forward to this ban being lted but old people are dying in the homes like flies. The economy is terrible. I would hate to have a small business because I’d have to close. “I miss getting out in the car most of all. I don’t drive all that far but I miss getting out down the road. That’s all gone. “I also used to walk for miles butyou went out on your own here now, they’d think you weren’t wise!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local charity has told us it is losing around pound, a month in revenues, through the loss of commercial income, donations and sponsorship. These are charities that we rely on.

Although the UK government has made a poundm commitment to support charities, we have been told by charities that there is a lack of clarity around eligibility for support, with many fearing they will not receive money – or will not receive it in time to survive. “This is the time when we have to support those charities that support us all.

The current situation is set to last until at least May  and as many seek comfort from the virus’ threat, they are turning their attention towards happier days. Re-runs of old TV programmes are filling the airwaves. The GAA has made  All-Ireland finals available to watch online. News archives are being pored over for hidden gems. Nostalgia is king at the moment, but Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell is not surprised by the phenomenon. googletag.cmd.push “It’s a really comforting emotion,” says the owner of Minding Me Psychologists. “It brings back times when we’ve been accepted and loved, and it provides some badly needed relief in these times of uncertainty. “People are generally frightened by change, because we don’t always feel like we’re in control of things. Having that sense of being in control is really important for our well-being. “We can retreat to the past and think of when times were good, and we felt like we were in more control of things. I think that really helps us to be more stabilised and feel better about things. googletag.cmd.push “I think sometimes we can use it as a wee bit of an escape as well. It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Judes story is all the more remarkable given that his book Why Does Daddy Always Look So Sad was first self published just last May.By October his searingly honest account of being autistic and being a father had been snapped up by Beyond Words the same American company that published worldwide best selling self help book The Secret.Judesays he wrote thebookfor his son Ethan, now , to show autstic peoples livescan be every bit as happy and fulfilled as those not on the spectrum. The title of the book came from a question Ethan, who is not autistic, askedJudesmum when he was just three.Judestarted writing the book to record his childhood and journey into fatherhood, after realising that most of the books on autism focused on children, not parents. googletag.cmd.push It was a bit of a bucket list thing, to have a book published before I was , he says.  I wanted to make a record of my early le and Ethans early le.Im proudly autistic now but that wasnt always the case.I used to try and hide it.After sending it off to a string of literary agents with no successJudepublished it himself and it went on to earn a stringof five star reviews on Amazon and attractedthe attention of one of the worlds leading consultants on autism, Maisie Soetantyo.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  also caught the eye of an American literary agent who took it to Beyond Words Publishing.Impressed byJudes warts and all story which detailed his childhood struggles, through to adaptingto becoming a parent they agreed to launch the book in the US with a speaking tour.Beyond Words Publishing get submissions from all over the world but they only publish about  books a year so for them to publish my book is just unbelievable, saysJude. googletag.cmd.push I never in my widest dreams thought this was going to happen.The publishers said the book resonates with people because its not about swimming the channel or climbing Everest, Im just a normal, relatable person.Im remarkably unremarkable but they thought it was important to get my story out there.For the past eight monthsJudehas been working closely with his publisher to plan the promotion of his book.They are eight hours behind me, so I wouldbe finishing work atpm and they would just be starting, he explains.But with the outbreak of the coronavirus all the carefully laid plans have had to be scrapped.Its in the lap of the gods, but I just dont want it to vanish without a trace, says Jude.I want to out it in frontof as many people as possible. Growing up dferentJude, who grew up in the Bogside before moving to the Waterside, says he knew from a young age that he was dferent.I have never felt not dferent, he says.ObviouslyI have always been autistic, and I always would have been aware too that other children would be out playing games or playing in the street and I spent most of my time alone.Juderecalls spending hours lining up his toy cars on the window sill of his childhood home in Gartan Square.By a stroke of luck the flat recently came up for sale and Locate Estate Agents agreed to let him come and have a look around.That was magic, saysJude.The atmosphere was still the same.I could just imagine my mammy and my daddy there and my wee sister Emily tottering aboutI rang up Locate because Im a chancer and said Ive written this book and its out all over the world and a lot of happened there.Growing up Jude went to the Model School Derry, Oakgrove and St Columbs College.I had a lot of help and support and at the time I was resentful of it, but I look back more fondlyat it now, he saysThere were no autism support groups in the city at that time, so when Jude was a teenager he joined cross community youth group Reach Across.His lazer focus and love of order were put to good use helping to organise activities and grant applications and at  he was invited back to the group as a leader.This led him on to a Social Work degree at Ulster University, Magee.The boy who has social dficulty ended up being a social worker, he smiles. Becoming a dadJudesaid he used to perceive autism as something that he had grown out of.He had a successful job as a social worker and was able to navigate le well. But becomingadad at the age of  threw his carefullyordered world into disarray.Instead of cherishing and celebrating this wee baby I was more preoccupied with wheres my sense of control , he admits.When Ethan was three he asked his granny the heart wrenching question why does daddy always look so sad , which was to become the title of the book.He was able to pick up that I wasnt happy or that I found things dficult, Jude explains.And he still knows when Im not happy.Hes  now and he knows that I like things done a certain way.I have a lot of buttons and he has lots of wee fingers to press them with, he laughs.So was Ethans question the catalyst that turned Jude into the perfect father No, that would be far too easy, he sighs.It wasnt a lightbulb moment.Embracing being autistic and fatherhood was a gradual process that has continued after the publication of the book.I had to give in and accept I was autistic.I would have said i have autism but I have become more educated and listened to autism voices and they would say they are autstic, not that they have autism.Its not a handbag or an accessory that you have.Its an intrinsic piece of someone.I used to think in my own head I have a condition, but its the way I am.Its not something fatal or that needs treatment.Judes view of autism has come full circle and he now regards it as a blessing.To me its an advantage and to a lot of autistic people its an advantage.Autistic people are the most passionate and driven iniduals.If it wasnt for autstic people there would be no fire, no wheel, no electricity, no music, no arts, nothing!   Reaching outSince publishing the book last yearJudehas given a series of talks and book signings which have given the -year-old social worker the chance to reach out to autistic children.I love meeting autistic kids.They are like me and I am like them.Im not in the business of giving parenting advice and when I give a talk to parents its always the kids who ask the questions.Theres a misconception that autistic kids dont know they are dferent.I want to tell them that things will be grand.He has also been contacted by people from around the world who have been touched by his story and he has encouraged anyone with questions to get in touch with him online.I reach out to people all the time and I have a black belt in responding, saysJude.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  is available on Amazon in both paperback and ebook.For more information seewww.judemorrowor theJudeMorrowAuthor page on Facebook.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

The cast, led by the remarkable Teresa O’Kane, produced their own version of the Black and White Minstrels Show, whose national production would later cause widespread controversy. Teresa’s son Joseph O’Kane was involved in the show and admits that the production would certainly not have happened in the current era. “It wouldn’t be too politically correct now,” he told the County Derry Post. “She had to get black and white dye out of some theatrical place in Belfast. Everybody was blackened up with white eyes. You couldn’t get the stuff off you for about two days afterwards!” googletag.cmd.push The show began le as a light entertainment show and ran for around  years on BBC prime time television, where it was hugely popular. A spin-off stage show also played for a decade at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, before going on tour to Australia and New Zealand. It courted controversy, however, when it was accused of racism and ethnic stereotyping by anti-racist groups in the UK due its use of the theatrical make-up known as ‘blackface’. From the boardwalks of London, the local production in rural south Derry proved a hit from the moment it debuted at St Patrick’s Hall in Castledawson on October , . googletag.cmd.push  The hall itself was built in  after local businessman Patrick Convery donated land on New Row and was used by both parish and club until it was rebuilt as St Patrick’s Church in . “They went round all the local clubs – Glen, Slaughtneil, Swatragh, Kilrea, Bellaghy and Lavey and the rest,” recalls Joseph. “It was really good. They had a chorus of these black and white minstrels and girls and then they had a few solo artists and other groups.” Joseph remembers Frank Toner standing out as the star, closing the show with a stirring rendition of a well-known classic. “Frank was a cousin of my mother’s, a big, stout man, I remember him well,” he said. “He sang ‘Mammy’ by Al Johnson and was really good at it. He looked the part, but he was a referee as well. “I remember him refereeing one day in Claudy and there was a wee bit of a skirmish. I was playing at the time and he come up to me and says “Right Joe, what’s your name ” One set-piece from the show has caused Joseph no end of amusement throughout the years that followed. “There was a thing called the Tiny Tots,” he said. “My mother found all these cubs of three or four years of age. She had gathered up a kit for every county in Ireland. I don’t know how she did it, there were no O’Neill’s shops back then. “I don’t know whether she got someone to make all those jerseys, because I don’t think they did children’s jerseys back then in . “So as the wee lads came out dressed in whatever county it was, the chorus would have sung a verse of a song that would relate to that county. “I get grown men coming up to me when I’m out and telling me: “I remember being in the Tiny Tots – I was Wexford”. The Black and White Minstrel show was cancelled by the BBC in , but its  adaptation on the banks of the Moyola still brings fond memories to all who witnessed it.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Schools officially closed because of the coronavirus pandemic on March . At the time, key workers were told that schools would remain open to provide supervised learning only for children who ‘absolutely need to attend’. Some parents have had dficulty finding places for their children including senior health care workers in the city. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Figures collected for Wednesday  April for Derry City and Strabane District Council showed that  schools responded to a daily survey as being open, with  children reported as attending open schools. Fty two schools responded as being closed. googletag.cmd.push “It should be noted that figures can fluctuate on a daily basis. Figures collected for the same day the previous week show that there were  children reported as being in open schools. “An interactive map displaying schools open for supervised learning can be accessed on the Education Authority website. This is updated daily.” According to today’s map, April , there are  schools open in Derry and the surrounding area but only three with pupils in attendance - Lisnagelvin P.S., Eglinton P.S. and Broadbridge P.S. Many people were unhappy with delays to school closures in the North. However, based on scientic advice on how to limit spread of the COVID- virus the decision was taken that children who can stay safely at home, should, to limit the chance of the virus spreading. googletag.cmd.push This is dferent in other countries and jurisdictions but is based on sound scientic advice, so that critical services can be maintained and the spread of the virus reduced. Parents and carers were advised to send their child to schoolthere is ‘no other viable option’. For many there is no other option at present, as childcare services have closed and people have been advised against leaving children with grandparents as they are amongst the high risk category. Supervised learning is about providing a facility in schools and pre-schools for vulnerable children and those of key and critical workers to allow parents to continue with their vital jobs.

The deal was first agreed in principle with the five major teaching unions last June, but has now been formally presented to members for approval. Siobhan McElhinney, a member of the union’s Northern Committee, said it has the potential to change the lives of teachers across all sectors. “One of the main selling points is the opportunity of getting the backpay,” she told the County Derry Post. “Members will be backpaid from September  and that is a major selling point. The ask was % and the unions have negotiated .%. That’s not bad in the world of negotiation. googletag.cmd.push “The other big strength is the workload. Beforehand, people negatively on social media were saying these things have been talked about. “They were, but they were never agreed with management and DE . Everybody has now totally supported this workload agreement. “This deal will change people’s lives. It will make a definite improvement to work-le balance for everybody.” The Covid- outbreak has forced the union to use an online poll for what would ordinarily be decided by postal ballot and members have voiced opposition over the timing of the deal. Voting in the poll is currently underway and will continue until Wednesday evening at .pm. googletag.cmd.push Social media posts from INTO encouraging members to approve the deal have prompted criticism, with some members also feeling it doesn’t go far enough to meet their demands. “This deal has been agreed in principle since last June,” said Siobhan. “Other public sector workers had issues and then you had the nurses who really deserved to get theirs sorted out and then we were coming along next. It was always going to be now. “In the south Derry area, we have -odd members and a lot of very, very positive reps in schools. There is a positive vibe, people see it as it is. “There are nine dferent workstreams and six of them are to be acted upon immediately. The Minister and the deal is allowing people to get their house in order and then we look again.” The Maghera native feels the deal provides an opportunity for a realignment in what is expected of teachers within their roles. She said: “The word ‘inspector’ terries people, but ETIhave produced a ‘myth-busting’ document to outline what they are looking for from a school. “Sometimes teachers go beyond what they’re supposed to do, and this [deal] actually asks them to keep in mind from now what they are supposed to be doing. “It’s like a Gaelic player on the football pitch. They play their time and when the whistle is blown, they stop. They don’t go into extra time unless they are asked to. “Teachers keep going beyond what they are supposed to be doing and that’s what causes exhaustion, leaves them shattered within their job and negative towards everything .” Siobhan says approval of the deal would not be the end of the process, but a new beginning and that the union would be working to ensure its benefits impact on their members. She said: “A lot of people are quietly delighted. For a teacher at the top of the main scale, net back pay is going to be in the region of pound,. “There are so many positives in the recognition of trade union movements, consultation on workload. We intend to help members implement it to improve their work-le balance. “If you have happy teachers, you have happy pupils and happy pupils make happy families.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families.

I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
