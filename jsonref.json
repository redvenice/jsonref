Most people would go to this bewitching country for two weeks, but you’re here for just two full days.It means a six-hour flight from Orlando to Lima, followed by a private charter to Cusco, which takes one hour and 20 minutes. Then hop on board the Hiram Bingham train (so named after the American explorer who brought the site to world attention in 1911) through the Sacred Valley of the Incas to Machu Picchu.Cusco, where your hotel is located, is nearly 12,000ft above sea level, but you’ll be comfortable at the Belmond Palacio Nazarenas hotel, where the 55 suites have oxygen piped into them. Some 2,500 people visit Machu Picchu every day, but worry not — you will get VIP entry before iding into small groups of six to ten per guide.          Go through the Sacred Valley of the Incas to Machu Picchu, above  Days four to six: Easter Island, ChileThe flight from Lima to Easter Island, one of the world’s most remote civilisations, is five hours and 20 minutes.If you were going on a commercial airline you would need 13 hours to fly via Santiago de Chile. But there’s no time to lose on arrival as you are only here for two nights, staying at the Hangaroa Eco Village and Spa, designed in homage to Orongo, a ceremonial Rapa Nui National Park site.Rooms are made from cypress logs, clay and volcanic rock. Get up close and personal with the extraordinary Moai statues carved between the 12th to 17th centuries, with heads weighing up to 82 tons. You’ll be given a miniature statue as your ‘pillow present’.          The iconic Moai statues can be viewed at Rano Raraku, Easter Island  Days six to seven: Apia, SamoaYou are now on your way to Australia (and should be developing good packing and unpacking skills), stopping for a night (after a, deep breath, nearly ten-hour flight) on this South Pacific island, crossing the international date line and so losing a day in the process.You check in at the Sheraton Samoa Beach Resort and then visit the former estate of Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson in Vailima. In the evening you head to a ‘fia-fia’ feast rooted in Polynesian culture, and are presented with a handmade silk sarong.          In the evening you head to a ‘fia-fia’ feast rooted in Polynesian culture, and are presented with a handmade silk sarong  Days seven to nine: Great Barrier Reef, AustraliaYour bucket list is filling up nicely — indeed, there must be a danger of it overflowing. But, hold tight, here comes yet another UNESCO World Heritage site.Samoa to Cairns in Queensland, Australia, is a flight of six hours and 25 minutes.Next you are transferred to the Great Barrier Reef, the planet’s largest coral reef system, comprising nearly 3,000 reefs and 900 islands stretching for more than 1,600 miles.Stay two nights at the five-star Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort and Spa (on a four-mile beach). Marine experts will take you to the northern reaches of the Great Barrier Reef so you can snorkel among an amazing array of tropical fish. A gift of a boomerang will be waiting in your room, naturally.          Marine experts will take you to the northern reaches of the Great Barrier Reef so you can snorkel among an amazing array of tropical fish  Days nine to 12: Angkor Wat, CambodiaIF you can no longer abide the person sitting next to you (including, presumably, your other half), this is when everyone has the chance to change seat as part of some sort of aviation musical chairs.You get three nights in Siem Reap, near Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world, built in the 12th century. After the seven-and-a-half hour flight from Cairns, the Raffles Grand Hotel should help iron out any stiffness.Your group will be treated to a private gala dinner in one of the temples after the hordes have departed, plus a performance of a classical Apsara dance.

It took 20,000 people 22 years to build it.Stay two nights at the Oberoi Amarvilas, the only hotel with uninterrupted views of India’s greatest treasure. A guide will also take you to the Red Fort and Emperor Akbar’s tomb.

Taj Mahal, India: It took 20,000 people 22 years to build what became one of the world\u0027s most iconic sites  Days 14 to 17: Serengeti Plain, TanzaniaAfrica is calling — although it requires a flight of almost eight hours before you get there. You are taken to the Four Seasons Safari Lodge Serengeti for three nights. Its five-star luxury is your base for Big Five spotting on two game drives each day.One morning you can enjoy a sunrise hot air balloon ride, and your last dinner will be eaten in the bush, following sundowners and a traditional Majuto dance. Look out for bone-handled salad tongs as your pillow prezzie — and then steel yourself for boarding that plane once again.          Africa is calling - although it requires a flight of almost eight hours before you get there  Days 17 to 19: Petra and Wadi Rum, JordanYou might be suffering from too much of a good thing — but keep some enthusiasm in reserve for Petra, which is on most people’s wishlist.It’s (only) five hours away from the Serengeti, and the last bit of the journey requires a mule and cart as you move along the mile-long gorge called the Siq.The Rose City (called this because of its pinkish hue) was possibly first settled as early as 9,000 BC, and combines traditional Nabataean rock-cut buildings with Hellenistic facades.Another outing takes you by 4x4 to Wadi Rum, with its lunar-like landscape which was much loved by T.E. Lawrence.Your room for two nights at the Movenpick will have commanding views of the Great Rift Valley.          The Rose City (called this because of its pinkish hue) was possibly first settled as early as 9,000 BC  Days 19 to 21: Marrakech, MoroccoSir Winston Churchill loved this crazy city (the flight from Petra is six hours and 40 minutes), saying it was ‘simply the nicest place on Earth to spend an afternoon’. You’ve got just 48 hours to be entertained by snake charmers and bamboozled into buying stuff you don’t need from persistent traders.Hopefully, you haven’t fallen out with too many in your group and you’ll be nicely cocooned in La Mamounia, one of the most famous hotels in the world. If you tire of the souks, go trekking in the foothills of the Atlas mountains. On Day 22 you fly back to Florida — or enjoy a cheese and ham toastie on a £29 Easyjet flight from Marrakech to Luton as a welcome back to the real world.

The sale of House of Fraser to Mike Ashley has once again seen a billionaire and bankers allowed to cash in on the collapse of a failing company while ordinary savers pay the priceThese were employees who spent their lives toiling at the counters and on the shop floors to keep the business afloat.Their savings are now being dumped into the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund, where they’re likely to see their retirement incomes chopped by 10 per cent.The bankers, in whose hands the future of House of Fraser was left, rejected a bid for the solvent company from retail tycoon Philip Day, probably because it would have left savers ahead of them in the list of creditors, leaving them unable to take their pound of flesh.This is a deep flaw in company law that puts workers and the firm’s obligations below the needs of bankers.The Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on savers, should be a last resort for when companies go completely under.But it is being abused and used as a safety net for opportunistic billionaires hoping to snap up the assets of a struggling firm.If they want the assets, the pensions should be part of the package.Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of the old burned out business, Mr Ashley has promised to turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.In the process though he’s burned the very workers who helped to keep it alive.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/10/4EFBD70000000578-6046713-image-a-17_1533893396114.jpg","title":"England cricket star Ben Stokes admits significant memory blackout","story":"England cricket player Ben Stokes and his wife Clare arrive at Bristol Crown Court todayEngland cricketer Ben Stokes today said  he was looking up at the sky and talking to God after having at least ten drinks on the night of a street brawl.During his affray trial the 27-year-old has already claimed he fought off an \u0027attack with weapons\u0027 after coming to the aid of two gay men being abused in Bristol.The all-rounder said he was acting as peacemaker to protect two men he had just met when he feared for his safety and the scene descended into a brawl.Stokes lashed out at Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27 - knocking both men unconscious - in an act of self-defence, he told a jury, having confronted them over their \u0027nasty\u0027 homophobic language towards Kai Barry and William O\u0027Connor.Prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis suggested to Stokes that he had been angry, shouted and pointed at bouncer Andrew Cunningham who had refused to shake his hand.He asked him if he had been angry in CCTV scenes of the incident shown to the court. \u0027I don\u0027t think you can tell if I\u0027m angry,\u0027 Stokes replied.When the prosecutor asked what Stokes was looking at in the footage, he said: \u0027I might just be looking at the night sky.\u0027Mr Corsellis said: \u0027Who were you speaking to when you were looking at the night sky?\u0027  Stokes replied: \u0027God?\u0027     Stokes takes down his umbrella after arriving at court for the continuation of his trial todayMr Corsellis asked: \u0027Mr Stokes, you are just in front of the jury, trying to cover up your actions.

He had run past one of my friends, with the bottle, attempting to hit him and then actually struck someone with the bottle.\u0027I was trying to stop Mr Ali from doing damage to anyone with a glass bottle.\u0027 Stokes denied taunting Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, insisting he was the one being mocked for his designer trainers and his admitted questionable fashion sense. The prosecution has accused Stokes of mimicking the flamboyant pair\u0027s \u0027camp\u0027 mannerisms minutes before he \u0027lost control\u0027 and the brawl broke out.Jurors were yesterday shown the Buscemi high-top trainers that Stokes was wearing in the early hours of September 25 last year. The white Italian leather shoes, which feature a gold padlock on each heel, were held aloft by defence solicitor Gordon Cole QC.Stokes, a father of two who plays county cricket for Durham, told jurors: \u0027My attire on that night got mentioned. It was one of the gay couple.          Stokes and teammate Alex Hales were together (pictured on the night) after celebrating with the England cricket team, who had just beaten the West Indies in a one-day international\u0027I get told by quite a lot of my teammates that I dress the worst in the team. We both exchanged comments about what one another were wearing.\u0027 Wearing a white shirt with a light blue shirt and tie as he took the stand yesterday, Stokes was watched by wife Clare Ratcliffe from the front row of the public gallery. Stokes said he drank at least ten alcoholic drinks on the night of the incident, including two or three pints of lager and at least seven vodka-lemonades.Asked by Mr Cole if he was homophobic, Stokes said: \u0027No, absolutely not. The only comments between myself and the gay couple was what we had chosen to wear that night.\u0027He also denied humiliating nightclub doorman Andrew Cunningham, who said he and Hales couldn\u0027t come in, adding: \u0027I didn\u0027t use the c-word towards him. I said to him \u0027come on mate, I\u0027ve got s*** tattoos as well, let us back in\u0027.\u0027Mr Cole asked Stokes: \u0027At any stage had you become enraged for any reason at all in the incident you had been involved with, from leaving Mbargo?\u0027Stokes replied: \u0027I find it a difficult question to answer.\u0027He also said he could not remember who he contacted following his arrest. He told jurors: \u0027I was stuck in a bit of a problem as I wasn\u0027t sure who was the best person to contact.               Stokes starred in the cricket last week (pictured) as England beat India at Edgbaston\u0027Being a cricket player, I have a manager who looks after my stuff. I also had a fiancee who I was pretty sure needed to be contacted. I can\u0027t actually remember who was contacted.\u0027Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, and Ali, of Bristol, both deny affray. The judge yesterday directed jurors to find Hale not guilty. Today, Judge Peter Blair QC adjourned proceedings until Monday morning.He told the jury they would be hearing closing speeches on Monday morning from the advocates before he begins to sum up the case.The trial continues."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/16/4EFE9BCA00000578-6047617-image-a-19_1533915756492.jpg","title":"Justin Theroux keeps cars Jennifer Anistons Bel Air home photos show","story":"    Shifting gears?

Crowds are an issue at the Taj Mahal (especially if you want a selfie on the ‘Princess Diana’ bench, where she sat solo during a Royal tour in the dying days of her marriage), but special guides know how to circumnavigate the hoi polloi.          Taj Mahal, India: It took 20,000 people 22 years to build what became one of the world\u0027s most iconic sites  Days 14 to 17: Serengeti Plain, TanzaniaAfrica is calling — although it requires a flight of almost eight hours before you get there. You are taken to the Four Seasons Safari Lodge Serengeti for three nights. Its five-star luxury is your base for Big Five spotting on two game drives each day.One morning you can enjoy a sunrise hot air balloon ride, and your last dinner will be eaten in the bush, following sundowners and a traditional Majuto dance. Look out for bone-handled salad tongs as your pillow prezzie — and then steel yourself for boarding that plane once again.          Africa is calling - although it requires a flight of almost eight hours before you get there  Days 17 to 19: Petra and Wadi Rum, JordanYou might be suffering from too much of a good thing — but keep some enthusiasm in reserve for Petra, which is on most people’s wishlist.It’s (only) five hours away from the Serengeti, and the last bit of the journey requires a mule and cart as you move along the mile-long gorge called the Siq.The Rose City (called this because of its pinkish hue) was possibly first settled as early as 9,000 BC, and combines traditional Nabataean rock-cut buildings with Hellenistic facades.Another outing takes you by 4x4 to Wadi Rum, with its lunar-like landscape which was much loved by T.E. Lawrence.Your room for two nights at the Movenpick will have commanding views of the Great Rift Valley.          The Rose City (called this because of its pinkish hue) was possibly first settled as early as 9,000 BC  Days 19 to 21: Marrakech, MoroccoSir Winston Churchill loved this crazy city (the flight from Petra is six hours and 40 minutes), saying it was ‘simply the nicest place on Earth to spend an afternoon’. You’ve got just 48 hours to be entertained by snake charmers and bamboozled into buying stuff you don’t need from persistent traders.Hopefully, you haven’t fallen out with too many in your group and you’ll be nicely cocooned in La Mamounia, one of the most famous hotels in the world. If you tire of the souks, go trekking in the foothills of the Atlas mountains. On Day 22 you fly back to Florida — or enjoy a cheese and ham toastie on a £29 Easyjet flight from Marrakech to Luton as a welcome back to the real world.

It contains a year-by-year list of the books I read, almost all of which I borrowed from libraries in the south London suburbs, which I’d cycle to every afternoon after school.My eldest son was amazed when I showed it to him, and he even turned the pages for a few minutes. “You were 11 years old and you read 86 books in one year!” Yes I began with Biggles, Enid Blyton, Arthur Ransome and the autobiographies of footballers and cricketers. In the middle I read Nevil Shute, Nicholas Monsarrat, Len Deighton and Erskine Caldwell, writers pretty much forgotten now, as most of us will be. But in 1974, I’m relieved to see that I go out on a high, with Marcel Proust, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche.I was thrilled to have impressed my son at last. Then he added: “But I guess there was nothing else to do in the evenings.”He was right about that. Yet out of the interminable zombie boredom and restlessness of Bromley – a commuter town placed between the city and the Kent countryside – a lot happened while nothing appeared to be happening. Much of this went into my first novel The Buddha of Suburbia, which, despite the dour reality, I managed to make into a comedy about being mixed-race in Britain during the punk era.I’d never had the conviction I was cut out for regular work like other men in the neighbourhood. My interesting friends dressed like Jimi Hendrix and went into music. But for me, words were the lifeline. One morning at school, staring out of the window, it occurred to me to become a writer. Being an artist for a living was surely the loveliest thing! Suddenly the world appeared to open up. For the first time I had an identity and future. I was going somewhere.All writers are readers first, and I read everything in the newspapers we had delivered, the  and the . When I became a paperboy I sat on the kerb to read them at 6.30am. While eating, I even found myself reading the labels on ketchup jars and most weekends my father would drag me around secondhand bookshops on Charing Cross Road, a habit I still can’t give up. Flipping through my notebook I can see my preoccupations then – literature, politics, sport, philosophy and, importantly, people’s passion for one another – are still my preoccupations.Experience is always too much when you’re young, but there were writers who knew how to pin it down and even make it enticing. I wanted to do that. I was looking for something that could be called inspiration, because words come out of other words, and writers come from other writers. Influence is essential and if you’re lucky one day the Muse will deign to give you a kiss, making you race to your desk and stay there, mixing what you’ve read with reality to make a new story for others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23eeec0088d94850858119dc7fc6be23e4ef4c5/0_164_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97d83a93ce73f61123cc9e455366f74e","title":"house of fraser customers react to sports direct takeover","story":"On Guildford High Street, top concerns are whether store will retain reputation and staffThe House of Fraser department store on Guildford High Street was popular on Friday afternoon. As the summer rain beat down outside, customers streamed in through its doors to seek shelter, meet friends and family or kill time browsing the shelves and rails.Earlier in the day, it was announced that Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, had bought the struggling retailer in a £90m rescue deal.For customers in Guildford who had heard the news, the biggest concerns were whether the retailer would retain its upmarket reputation as well as its 17,000 staff.“It could be interesting days, to see what happens with the man who buys it,” said Cyril Clark, 66. “It’s a sad day to see House of Fraser in the state it’s in, it’s a good store to come to. It’s a very different brand to Sports Direct, and my concern is Mike Ashley will bring Sports Direct into places like this.”Clark’s wife, Julia, 61, added: “It depends what he’s going to do with the brand, whether he’ll keep it as an upmarket store or changes it. “You need the right people working for you in order to create the right environment. If Ashley is not nice to his staff he won’t attract the right staff. And if you have less discerning staff, with less experience, customers might be told incorrect information. You’d expect a store in this place in the market to give a certain level of customer service.”Jonathan Lee, 63, echoed this sentiment: “My immediate thoughts would be if there are redundancies and if people will be asked to take lower pay. “But maybe they can make the brand of House of Fraser continue, and I suppose this situation is the best you can hope for for any of this.”The company’s collapse represents a wider trend whereby high street retailers battle to survive in today’s tough market, saturated by a combination of people shopping more online and wary consumers who have tightened their purse strings.Friends Sylvie Roberts, 75, and Linda Coleman, 72, who were having a catch-up in the store, said they were delighted that House of Fraser was being saved. “We’ve spent all day feeling very sad about the business. I think they have to do whatever they need to do to keep people employed, there’s no other choice. We’ve been shopping here for the past 50 years, buying presents and whatever. They cover everything really and the staff are lovely.”Another shopper, Julie, who declined to give her surname, said: “I think it’s a shame because I can’t remember it not being here. I would be slightly horrified if this place became a Sports Direct. Is Guildford the right place for this? I’ve been a customer for 30 years, I meet friends here for coffee and have a browse. It has all your essentials.”Meanwhile, social media users adopted a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the news.“Get yourself down to House of Fraser, they’re about to start doing Slazenger umbrellas and Donnay socks at half price,” said @MrPaulRobinson on twitter.“Just wait for those glorious House of Fraser giant mugs with every purchase,” said @NickJonHughes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6507896e75c62a5199fdb2c7ef584df395c445a5/0_19_3499_2099/master/3499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f5f4973b687e502bae213c9d3a96542","title":"seven more marks and spencer stores close as restructuring continues","story":"The high-street chain is aiming to reduce costs by £350m over the next three yearsSeven Marks \u0026amp Spencer clothing stores will close their doors for the last time on Saturday as the high-street chain pushes ahead with a radical transformation plan. The retailer announced in May that it plans to close 100 stores by 2022, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. As part of the business restructuring, M\u0026ampS will also be looking to reduce its costs by £350m by 2021. On Saturday, clothing stores in Northampton, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey retail park in Speke, Stockton and Walsall will trade for a final day – while a Simply Food in Bayswater, London, will also close. Three stores in Fleetwood, Newton Abbott and Darlington have already ceased trading as part of the phase of closures. Three more, in East Kilbride and Clacton and Holloway Road in London are expected to close at a later date. The latest round of closures comes after 21 stores were wound up by the chain. On Friday, Steve Rowe, M\u0026ampS chief executive, said: “There are likely to be more redundancies.” The firm’s chairman, Archie Norman, said the size of the company’s store portfolio had become “a drag on our performance”. “For me, the results in the next two years aren’t the most important thing. We are here to deliver a profitable, growing business in five years’ time,” Norman said. “This is probably the biggest turnaround in UK retail.” Norman joined the business last year to help lead a turnaround, and said on Tuesday that he wanted to present the “unvarnished truth” about its prospects. He said M\u0026ampS faced competition on many fronts, both from online retailers and from discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark. To improve its operations, M\u0026ampS has been moving from its old IT systems and has been shutting warehouses in its distribution network. M\u0026ampS has already announced that it is closing its warehouses in Warrington and Neasden, and Rowe said on Tuesday that the future of the Castle Donington warehouse was under review.

Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat.

Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

It’s the last time I speak about it. It’s over, the market is closed. That’s football management. I think football is changing and managers should be called head coaches.”He added: “We play against a team that invest more than us. They spent more money than us, so in the Premier League we must get used to teams with players of the same quality that we have. Forget the name, the history, the shirt, every match is difficult.”Nonetheless Mourinho was pleased with his team’s display, singling out Pogba and Shaw for particular praise, and the overall spirit.Claude Puel, the visiting manager, said: “It was a shame to concede this goal at the beginning of the game. We allowed them to remain deep and close the space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d378b3916721a50011df78b60cd9d95c1e43d3ab/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20526a58e9ea800b7c490a205e5a7f54","title":"wolves fulham cardiff premier league prospects","story":"The three teams to come up from the Championship are all on different paths, but all look capable of staying up and maybe doing a lot more besidesThe summer is ending, the new season is here, and three fresh clubs are joining the Premier League, charged with the innocent hope that they can be the latest to establish themselves in the glitziest ision of them all. In August, it is easy to feel that way without any logic, the cynicism from last season washed away.But this time, might the good vibes from Wolves, Fulham and Cardiff be genuinely justified? Is this the best-prepared trio to ever join the Premier League? Usually the sole aim of new clubs arriving in the top flight is survival, but you could make a pretty convincing case that at least two of the new class could not only stay up, but finish in the top 10. Wolves have augmented a squad that was probably already Premier League standard, Fulham have had arguably the most eye-catching transfer window in the whole ision, and Cardiff are managed by Neil Warnock, so anything could happen.Sights are certainly set high. “We’re looking at doing more than surviving,” Wolves’ managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, said this summer. “I think the strategy we’ve had has been about building a squad and a structure we think is going to be viable to take us further, beyond promotion.” No “we’ll take each game as it comes, we’re just aiming for 40 points” here.The money helps. It is not a startling revelation that there is more cash in the Premier League than the rest of European football. But occasionally a reminder of just how much is handy: when the English transfer window closed on Thursday, the 10 clubs promoted to the top isions of Germany, France, Italy and Spain had spent around £40mput together this summer. Cardiff, Fulham and Wolves spent close to £200m.That money has allowed Fulham to sign Jean Michaël Seri, who last summer nearly joined Barcelona. Wolves have made a few of their high-value loan signings from last term their own as well as attracting Rui Patrício and João Moutinho and breaking their transfer record (again) for Adama Traoré. Even the relatively parsimonious Cardiff have made their second and third most expensive signings (Josh Murphy and Bobby Reid), but they have some longer-term plans for the Premier League windfall.“When Burnley went up a few years ago they went down again straight away. But they built a new training complex and it gave them the building blocks to come back up again, and they’ve never looked back. Although we don’t want to go down, we’ve got to make sure the club is in a better place.”Burnley are the model for a team like Cardiff but they are also an example of why all three clubs should be optimistic. Without wishing to diminish the fine work of Sean Dyche, that Burnley came seventh while going two months in the middle of the season without winning a game perhaps says more about the mediocrity in the rest of the ision than about how brilliant they were. Burnley finished 21 points behind Liverpool in fourth place. They also finished 21 points ahead of Swansea, who were relegated.The morass of teams between the top six and the drop zone was, last season, a largely indistinguishable mush. Was there a huge difference between the teams that went down and those that finished in “comfortable” mid-table? A bit, but not much. Were West Ham appreciably better than Swansea? Were Southampton, who survived by three points, significantly worse than mid-table Bournemouth? Not really.On paper some of those teams have improved: West Ham have reacted to the dithering of last summer and spent decisively, Brighton have made some exciting moves and Southampton will be better for having Mark Hughes from pre-season. But the point is that none of the promoted three, particularly Wolves and Fulham, should be scared by any of their competitors.Those two already have terrific sets of players: for Wolves, the brilliant Rúben Neves sometimes looked like he was playing a different sport to most of his Championship peers, while the forward Diogo Jota and the frequently overlooked defender Conor Coady complete their strong spine.Fulham have Tom Cairney and the player everyone should be extremely excited about seeing this season, Ryan Sessegnon. They also have a manager unwilling to compromise on his approach. “We are not going to change the style,” Slavisa Jokanovic told Marca. “We are not going to hit balls or park the bus. It would not be a good plan. The Premier League is very demanding, we need to change things. But we’re not going to give up our style.”Those strong bases have been added to nicely. In addition to Seri, Fulham have brought back the bulldozing Aleksandar Mitrovic, taken Calum Chambers and André Schürrle on loan from Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund respectively and picked up Alfie Mawson from Swansea. Patrício and Moutinho are high-class additions to an already high-class Wolves side, the former arriving as one of nine Sporting players who rescinded their contracts following a turbulent season that culminated in around 50 masked intruders breaking into the club’s training ground and assaulting players and staff. Portugal’s goalkeeper at the World Cup was thus signed for nothing, although Sporting still say they are seeking compensation. Wolves have also signed the midfielder Leander Dendoncker on loan from Anderlecht.As for Cardiff, Reid is a good purchase from Bristol City, and at £3.5m goalkeeper Alex Smithies could be a bargain. But despite the riches of the Premier League, they know how quickly a club in their position can get blown away by more established buyers.But Warnock recognises that whoever they buy, the season is likely to be a struggle. “We realise it’s going to be a hell of a difficult job,” he says. “When every bookie in the country has you down to finish bottom …” – he breaks off to laugh heartily – “… not many give us hope! We will enjoy it, because we shouldn’t really be here. Instead of fearing it, we’ve got to enjoy every minute.”These are three very different clubs approaching life back in the top flight in very different ways. But it is interesting that they all seem to be looking beyond mere survival. Wolves want a status befitting their ambition. Fulham want substance without compromising on style. Cardiff are trying to build something for the long term.Last season all three promoted sides avoided relegation, only the second time that has happened in the last 15 years. Don’t bet against this trio repeating the feat, and perhaps achieving even more besides."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09865bfca6a3916215098e2d1e17d1eac72647e7/0_103_3584_2150/master/3584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ebb0ea1a3d59d5f7453aad53c2822c","title":"the big premier league preview football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and John Brewin for Football Weekly’s bumper preview of the 2018-19 Premier League seasonRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Middlesbrough v Birmingham was a Premier League staple a decade ago or so.Nick Miller on the new boys Wolves play Everton in today’s 5.30pm kickoff. North of the border, and Celtic are 1-0 down to Hearts, which blows open the title race. Over to you, Wee Stevie? Just under ten minutes to play in the early kickoff.The big news is that Kepa does start for Chelsea, so Rob Green doesn’t get a go. Or Willy Caballero. Ross Barkley gets a chance, a big chance. Eden Hazard is on the bench, which freezes out Callum Hudson-Odoi, a little disappointingly.It is back and with a fairy warm sense of vengeance. After Manchester United’s defeat of Leicester gave José Mourinho disappointingly little to complain about and St James’ Park started with a Keegan-esque fountain of goals in the early kick-off that is still being played between Newcastle and Tottenham, time for the kick-offs at 3pm. That tradition was abandoned for lucre years ago means there are just four Premier League matches at that time, but that does not mean they should be ignored. The first day will always throw up some intangibles, and not least Huddersfield v Chelsea, where the Mauricio Sarri regime begins in earnest after that shaky performance in the Community Shield last week and the jettisoning of Thibaut Courtois the keeper for, er Kepa. Chelsea’s season is brought to you by lastminute after Sarri turned up with just four weeks to go, with Antonio Conte still on the training ground. Huddersfield meanwhile attempt to repeat the alchemy of last season’s survival. Terence Kongolo and Eric Durm are their big new arrivals. Just an added thought: will Kepa’s late arrival mean Rob Green is handed the Chelsea gloves? Always good to catch the new boys early, and Bournemouth v Cardiff will see Harry Arter not able to play for Neil Warnock, having been loaned there by his parent club. Both Bournemouth and Cardiff made only fairly cosmetic changes to their squad so this looks a case of as you were, to use a phrase Liam Gallagher has ruined. Fulham v Crystal Palace is another bow for a promoted side, and unlike parsimonious Cardiff, Fulham have splashed some serious cash, over £100m of it. Palace, on something of a shoestring, have done far less business but held on to Wilfried Zaha, while Roy Hodgson has signed a new deal. Mr Roy remains hugely popular at Craven Cottage, and rightfully so. Last, and let’s face it, very possibly least, is Watford v Brighton. Javi Gracia achieved what some thought impossible, in not being sacked as manager by the Pozzo family at the end of the season, but may be under no little pressure his club sold players rather than invested over the summer. Brighton had a fine season last season, and to follow the instincts of club owner Tony Bloom, the gaming tycoon, have rolled the dice with new signings, almost a new team in fact. A note of caution here, or at least a warning from history. Chris Hughton did a fine job with Norwich a few years back after getting them to promotion, and to wide acclaim. He struggled in the following 2013-14 season - remember Ricky van Wolfswinkel? - as he tried to assimilate new blood that looked to have made Norwich certainties for mid-table. Hughton was sacked with a month of the season left, and to no avail. Perhaps one to watch there. And, of course, after an excellent opening weekend last weekend there is always the EFL where, quite frankly, anything can happen and usually does.

Spurs start the season with a good win on a ground where Newcastle don’t lose too often. It was a close game, settled by Dele Alli’s smart header in the first half. We’ll have reaction and a full match report shortly.90+4 min Diame is booked for a foul on Kane.90+3 min Newcastle probably deserve a point, having hit both the post and the bar. I doubt there is anything for them to worry about this season.90+2 min Yedlin is being helped off, so Newcastle will finish the match with 10 men. He doesn’t look in pain but he is struggling to put weight on his right leg.90 min There will be four added minutes. Yedlin is down and looks in a lot of pain. He planted his right foot very awkwardly after stretching for a high ball this might be ligament damage.88 min Spurs make their final change, with Eric Dier limping off to be replaced by the 21-year-old debutant Luke Amos.85 min: Rondon hits the bar! Newcastle’s new No9 almost equalises on his debut. Shelvey played a crisp pass to the edge of the area, where Rondon ignored the challenge of Davies. That gave him time out of his feet and sweep a shot that hit the stretching Vertonghen, wrongfooted Lloris and looped tantalisingly onto the face of the bar!84 min Spurs are keeping Newcastle at arms length for the time being. The atmosphere is very quiet.82 min Muto wriggles into the box and wins a corner for Newcastle. Shelvey’s inswinger is fisted away by Lloris.81 min Newcastle’s final change: the debutant Yoshinori Muto replaces Ayoze Perez.80 min A Spurs substitution: Son replaces Dele Alli, who scored a fine goal and has probably been the Man of the Match.79 min Davies clips the ball down the left to Eriksen, who races into the box and lifts a cross that flashes past Dubravka and out of play on the far side.78 min “That shot from Dembele makes me ask, why is there not a practice pitch where subs can actually touch the ball and take a shot rather than just stretch some muscles?” asks Daniel Friedman. “Like in baseball pitchers warm up with some pitches in the bullpen — why no footie bullpen?”I suppose any new stadiums need that space for the Michelin-starred restaurant. 77 min Spurs appear to have declared at 2-1, which is a dangerous game away from home. Newcastle are having most of the ball now.75 min “Welcome to a new season,” says Felix Wood. “It’s too early for it, there’s no getting away from that. Not sure I agree with you on referees being reluctant to give cards being a good thing. I may be biased, but Croatia being able to haul down England players whenever it looked like there was a break on without fear of anything worse than giving away a free kick still rankles. Cynicism should always be punished in my book.”That’s a fair point (though I didn’t notice it in the England game). But I think it’d be good if referees were able to make a distinction between cynical fouls and, for want of a better word, honest ones.73 min After a flurry of chances at the start of the second half, the game and the crowd have gone a bit quiet.71 min Eriksen plays a square pass to Dembele, who blooters high and wide from 25 yards.70 min Ritchie is furious at being substituted. He’s effing at anyone and everyone, grinding his teeth in frustration.69 min A Spurs change: Mousa Dembele replaces the slightly disappointing Lucas Moura. And Newcastle have brought on Christian Atsu for the excellent Matt Ritchie.68 min Kane gives the ball away to Kenedy, fouls him and is booked.67 min Ritchie is lucky not to be booked for a deliberate foul on Davies. It feels like referees are becoming more reluctant to show yellow cards, which is a welcome development.66 min Dier, already booked, fouls Perez. Some referees would have sent him off for that, but I think Martin Atkinson was right not to do so.65 min Here’s Christian Svanes Kolding. “From Brooklyn, where darkened skies have descended to unleash heavy lashings of rain - cue Michael Bay - I can enthusiastically second the endorsement of yeast on the popcorn,” says Christian. “It really brightens up your day and adds a bit of zing to your step. Now, if only Eriksen would score then this Dane would be well pleased.”64 min This is a good spell for Newcastle. If I was Mauricio Pochettino I’d bring on Son for Kane, who is as peripheral as he was at the World Cup. Something isn’t right there. 62 min This has been such an open game, surprisingly so given the quality of the two defences.60 min: Fine save by Lloris! That corner was not cleared properly by Spurs, and Perez hit an excellent shot on the turn from the corner of the six-yard box. Lloris had almost no reaction time but plunged to his right to make a brilliant stop.59 min Ritchie plays a fine pass behind the defence for Joselu, but Sanchez scoots back to concede a corner. Good defending. That’s Joselu’s last touch: he is replaced by the new signing Salomon Rondon.58 min Joselu is booked for a lunge at Eric Dier.58 min Spurs are playing some lovely stuff now, with Alli and Eriksen to the fore. If they play like this when Kane is back to his best, they will be some team. 57 min Aurier’s cross is half cleared by the flying Dubravka and volleyed over acrobatically by Sanchez. He could have had a hat-trick today.56 min Lucas Moura and Kane work the ball out to Davies, who hammers a cross into the area. It finds Sissoko, who sweeps a first-time shot towards goal that is superbly saved by Dubravka!53 min A brilliant dummy from Alli allows him to nutmeg Yedlin without touching the ball. He is having a fine game. Yes, yes, I know that’s not technically a nutmeg but you know what a mean.51 min: What a chance for Kenedy! Joselu’s superb pass found him in all sorts of space on the left of the box, but Kenedy’s first touch was poor and that allowed Lloris to sprawl at his feet and save. The ball came back to Kenedy, who shovelled it across the face of goal, and Aurier was able to clear desperately.50 min Alli almost makes it 3-1. Eriksen’s cross from the right took a touch off Kane, which affected Alli as he made another brilliant late run into the box. He couldn’t put the brakes on and the ball hit him before looping towards goal, with Dubravka able to make a comfortable save.49 min “Re Matt Dony’s plea (31 min), I’ve cut out dairy (it was killing me and it’s still killing the planet) and I can confirm that nothing really replaces cheese,” says Gary Naylor. “The best alternatives are houmous - especially leavened with pomegranate seeds or something exotic - or guacamole (but watch the fat). A decent red might work better than the whisky too. PS I remain a less than convincing advert for such abstemious diets - though my kids are!” 47 min: Diame hits the post! The chance came out of nothing. Shelvey’s towering header sent the ball into the Spurs area, where it dropped nicely for Diame on the left of the box. He took the ball down deftly and thundered a rising left-footed shot that clattered off the outside of the near post. I think Lloris was beaten.47 min “I assume Matt has tried nut-based cheeses (excuse me, cheezes, for EU lawyers’ sake), but they are truly awful,” says James Hupp. “Hummus seems to be the only way to go here. And it doesn’t totally rule out having someone over, whereas asking someone to partake of cashew-derived cheddar alternatives might.”46 min Peep peep! Newcastle get the second half under way.A bit of half-time reading“Ready Salted crisps are the ideal accompaniment to whisky,” says Josse McMahon and nones of others.Half-time chit chat “Afternoon, Rob,” says Ian Copestake. “How was your pre-season? Did the  put you all through your paces at an internet cafe in Marbella? The paint-ball team-building exercise might have been a tad unnecessary though.”The boot camp was the killer. It was a breeze to go without food or water, but to deprive journalists of Twitter for 72 hours was just barbaric.Peep peep! That was 45 minutes of good, clean fun. Spurs deserve to be ahead, though there isn’t much in it. See you in 15 minutes for the second half.44 min Though they are behind, Newcastle will go into half-time in decent spirits. They have played much better in the last 15 minutes, with the wide attackers Kenedy and Ritchie increasingly influential. 43 min “As a vegan for a number of years, I can say popcorn dusted with nutritional yeast is a delightful treat,” says Joshua Reynolds. “No, really.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c74421697c5223e99abb54a0c65cabbeb9653c/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1152942205ddecd2a96045b9fb13cf1","title":"win a weekend away at a premier inn anywhere in the uk and ireland","story":"Enter this prize draw for your chance to head to the UK destination of your choice with accommodation courtesy of Premier InnWhether you’re a family hoping to explore somewhere new and different, or friends seeking somewhere off the beaten track, if you’re the lucky winner you can choose a destination from over 750 hotels across the UK and Ireland.You’ll be able to enjoy the soundest sleep on luxury Hypnos beds, a seriously tasty all-you-can-eat breakfast and a delicious dinner at our restaurant.

But it will be worth it when I get out of the hammam on the first day.When I was little, we went to the public baths because there was no running water in the flats where my family lived – in Oran, Algeria’s second city. Now it’s a choice. Tata Houeria, my favourite uncle’s wife, jumps at any excuse to go to the hammam, especially when I’m visiting and she can get her hands on me. She has taught me the power of communal bathing.The hammam is not just about washing it’s a social activity that brings the women of the family together. It’s also about ritual Houeria takes pleasure in carefully packing the soap, loofahs and stools into a special bag. Once inside, women exchange their black abayas for white towels before stepping into the hot, steamy room. Toddlers and the elderly are bathed by family members while they gossip with friends. As soon as I feel the steam, I’m transported back to being very small and stroking my aunt’s buttery-soft skin.She always finds the strongest masseuse, often the one with a cigarette dangling from her lips, to give me a proper scrub down on a marble slab. As they scrape the pollution off my skin, I am scolded for not going to the hammam in London. My feeble attempts to exfoliate can’t compare with what these women do.My cousins and I now extend the ritual with a trip to the salon to get our hair done.

Everyone knows that a lot of what you see on social media is fake: it’s just the best bits of everyone’s day. So, to stay sane, I try to take regular breaks and hang out with my husband and children (my second child was born last month). I also make sure that if I post a photo of myself looking amazing, I also do some Instagram stories of myself with no makeup on, looking terrible. I want my audience to see a realistic representation of me, especially as a lot of them are quite young.I’m 29 now and started experimenting with makeup when I was 16, as I became conscious of my looks at secondary school in Cardiff. I am glad it happened later in my teen years at that time, I had an eating disorder and I don’t know how bad that could have got if I had started getting into beauty products and looking at myself any earlier. By 18, I had established my own personal style and knew fashion was the industry I wanted to work in long term. I now like to test new products and have made some great discoveries, but there are a few favourites I always return to. These are the five I can’t live without.I use a brow strengthener by Shavata (£18, 8ml) on my eyelashes, rather than my brows. It’s essentially a tube of castor oil, but with an easy, roll-on applicator. After a phase of getting (and yanking off) eyelash extensions left me with 10 lashes on each eye, I tried this for a month of intensive rehab and it really helped.For the past month I’ve been using Alpha-H Liquid Gold (£33.50, 100ml) every night and my forehead wrinkles are nearly gone. Those wrinkles do my head in, as I’m always making silly facial expressions in my YouTube videos.

Here’s how it wentI tend to come to things late: Twitter, The Wire and puberty were all delayed arrivals into my life. And losing my virginity was no different. I rocked up to the University of Manchester in 2010 tragically chaste and sexually frustrated. It was what you might call a pre-“woke” epoch we were still drunk on lad culture. My flatmate Liam quickly fashioned himself as the top lad he would confess later that he’d made a secret bet that he could shag every girl in the group.By the middle of my first year, my turn had come. I was in his room on the pretence of “watching a film”, but the foregone conclusion – have sex, then pretend it never happened – was punctured irreparably. As we kissed, Liam whispered: “I’ve never had sex with a black girl before” – the anti-aphrodisiac for women of colour everywhere. That was the end of that. Luckily, university was full of other young, drunk people with plenty of leisure time, so it wasn’t too difficult to get laid. But an awareness of my race, and a persistent bout of thrush, followed me through university and beyond.I had spent most of my teens avoiding thinking about my ethnicity blending in and miracle boob growth were my principal wishes at that age. But at university my sense of “difference” was heightened. It wasn’t just confined to the obvious: the lack of BME students or academics, or the history lecturer who claimed that British colonialists were well-intentioned. It began to crop up in my love life – such as the time I was asked whether my vagina was pink inside (FYI, it is). The more I learned about racism and feminism, the smaller the pool of potential suitors became. While being thoughtful, funny, smart and able to put up with my unbearable flaws is a must, I became aware that my match also has to be serious about social justice to be my type on (recycled, sustainably sourced) paper. Today, my work involves researching the links between race and inequality for two thinktanks. If “woke” means being alert to injustice in society, especially racism, then I am on constant high alert. A potential partner needs to be at least on medium alert for it to be workable. Eventually, I took a vow to date woke men only. But only after numerous bad experiences.It was on exchange at the University of Toronto, aged 21, where the first racist domino fell. No longer shackled by my virginity, I woke up naked but for a coat on a stranger’s bathroom floor. I was pleased to find it was the flat of the best-looking guy at the frat party. We dated for a few months, but unfortunately Sam turned out to be a Republican and a biological racist. At a party, he told a confused group of fellow students that “black people are biologically predisposed to violence”, before tagging “Kim isn’t like that”, on to the end. Lucky me. An important lesson was learned: check if they’re overtly racist before intercourse.I’ve shared a bed and overpriced meal with some less obviously deplorable offenders back home in the UK. With a university boyfriend, the incompatibility started small. I collected newspaper clippings about institutional racism in the politan police, but he wasn’t convinced. I asked him not to smoke weed with me in public, explaining that the rules were different for me. He didn’t understand why I cared. After we broke up, he admitted that he never spoke up when people made racist or sexist comments at work. I knew our friendship was finally over when he sent me an ill-judged treatise on race from the white male’s perspective while “finding himself” in India.James Baldwin said that to be black and relatively conscious is “to be in a rage almost all the time”. It’s not the sexiest Tinder tagline, but dating someone “not woke” does leave you in a state of constant fury. I’m all for debate, but I don’t want my relationship to be reminiscent of Question Time. I’m looking for someone to be angry with, not at. There are enough other reasons in any relationship to be enraged, so why add another one?But even after my vow to find a woke guy, things didn’t go smoothly. There was the man who, while nice, wanted to talk about “whether Cecil Rhodes was that bad” before I’d even had a morning cuppa. While on a date at a smart restaurant, he asked whether I had a dad, because he knew this was “a problem” in my community. Once it became clear that he only dated women of colour, my doubts grew. Sure, people have types, but nothing makes you feel more like a trinket than being chosen for your ethnicity. No one would say “all white people” are their type, apart from white supremacists. People specify and give details: brown hair, blue eyes, tall or short. Perhaps they’ll even talk about personality! Black and mixed-race people are not a type.But after months of dates, attending parties together and the purchase of a Scrabble set, I had no idea whether or not I was still single. The funny thing about the Foreign Office is that it tends to make staff leave the country for years at a time, with no consideration of my dating plight. Would I have to start the whole, wretched woke man search from scratch?Kind of. Turns out our expiration date is coming up faster than expected: he’s getting a new post abroad. So when Weekend asked me if I would take part in their Blind Date series, I said yes. Fingers crossed he’s wide awake.Don’t sayAll Lives MatterOMG, I’m nearly as dark as you in this heat!But you guys have Beyoncé?I don’t know much about this, but...I’m just not that into politicsYou can’t say anything any moreThe N word or P word (even during Gold Digger)Do sayBlack lives matterWhat pronouns do you prefer?Racism is about power and prejudiceIt’s true, Britain didn’t build the railways in British IndiaPoverty is not the fault of poor peopleI don’t know about that subject, tell me moreCommenting on this piece?

I hoped a MyHeritage test would bring me the peace I needed my Irish mother had never been able to give me any information about my biological father. Raised by her and my white dad, I’d always longed for a country to attribute my blackness to, or for help answering the ubiquitous “Where are you from?” question. I’d spent years making up exotic-sounding combinations to justify my appearance (some days Jamaican-Spanish-Swedish other days half Brazilian, or half Iranian). But, at 24, I was done with occupying a box of black ambiguity. Could I finally get a clear answer?The results arrived by email on a summer’s day last year. I clicked on the “ethnicity estimate” link, which offers an analysis of DNA by country, my heart pounding as I scanned the digital map.I had no cultural knowledge of Nigeria should I now start claiming it as my own? Did the results mean my very distant ancestors were Nigerian, or that my biological father was probably from there? Why did my features resemble a typical west African? I felt more confused than ever.This wasn’t quite what the adverts had promised. Targeted marketing for home-testing kits shows smiling (often mixed-race) models under the banner “find out your ethnicity”, or urges people to book holidays based on their “DNA story”. It’s estimated the industry will be worth a staggering £7.7bn by 2022 in the last year alone, market leader AncestryDNA pulled in $1bn in revenue.While DNA home tests are more popular than ever, people are starting to raise questions about what happens after the results land. Concerns about the storage of sensitive genetic information were highlighted recently, when an open-source DNA testing site, GEDmatch, was used by the police to identify California’s Golden Gate Killer. As well as privacy concerns, there’s the emotional fallout of receiving confusing or life-changing results. Identities that have been cherished by families for generations can be dismantled overnight.Ayshah Blackman, in her 50s, is of Caribbean descent and lives in London. She had always known two things about her family: that they had Indian heritage, and that her father had another daughter he wasn’t in touch with. Last year, with his permission, she set about trying to track down her half-sister through the UKTV show The Secrets In My Family.Blackman was encouraged to take the AncestryDNA test as part of the programme, and thrilled to eventually connect with her long-lost sibling, living on the other side of London. But she was shocked by the details of the results according to the test, Ayshah had no Indian DNA at all. “It made me question my ancestry, the fact that I might not be what I thought I was. I began to think that my grandmother had had an affair, that my mother had an affair. My imagination ran riot,” she tells me.For people of African descent, whose inidual and collective histories are blurred by the legacies of colonialism, slavery and rape, what they know about their identities is particularly important. Blackman felt that one of the narratives woven through her family had been broken.“That little thing of not having any Indian ancestry is now sitting on my shoulder – I may not be as much a part of this tribe as I thought I was,” she says. “If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t.”YouTube is full of videos of people revealing their DNA results, often with “click me” headlines such as What Am I? and I Was Lied To – My Shocking Results. They film themselves “unboxing” test kits like a new toy and taking cheek swabs, and then cut to footage in which they analyse their results. Many seem astonished by what they find, and begin to question whether their parents have been unfaithful, or whether they have been misled about their heritage some clips are heartbreakingly difficult to watch.Rachel Nye, 30, from London, was also left without a clear answer. Nye’s mother has a black mother and a white father, but Nye has never known exactly where her grandmother was born.“My nana died in 2008 but was always very vague about where she came from. She often gave different answers,” Nye says. “Some days she was British-born, other days she was from Barbados, some days she was African. I remember seeing two passports – one of them was Kenyan – but the names and dates of birth were different.”Nye says she was frustrated by the lack of country breakdown within Africa despite the fact the vast majority of the world’s genetic variation comes from the continent, DNA testing companies often have very few samples from Africa.23andMe has launched a number of initiatives to redress this. In 2016, the company launched the African Genetics Project, offering free DNA kits to people with all four grandparents born in the same African country, or from the same ethnic or tribal group. Now it has launched the Populations Collaborations Program, which encourages researchers studying remote populations to submit their data to the website.But questions have been raised about the ethics of European and American scientists harvesting genetic information from Africans and African scientists for economic gain. 23andMe has announced plans to share the test results of five million customers with GlaxoSmithKline, the drugs giant, in order to facilitate the design of new drugs. (Users are asked if they want to participate in scientific research when they sign up.)Privacy is a major concern for everyone using these sites, but perhaps more so for those from minority backgrounds. For those who are already discriminated against, having their genome used against them – for example, in the criminal justice system – could have serious implications. AncestryDNA’s privacy agreement states it can only share a customer’s DNA with research partners with explicit consent but it could disclose personal information to law enforcement if requested. (An internal report revealed that in 2017, AncestryDNA received 34 law enforcement requests, and provided information to 31.) MyHeritage asks customers to email if they want their sample removed from its database, though a representative tells me that the company does not sell or share DNA data with third parties. “We would need the explicit permission of our users – we do not own anyone’s DNA”, I am told on the phone. In 2010, to illustrate the privacy risks, researchers from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts identified nearly 50 people who had participated in an anonymous genomic study, based on publicly accessible information.There are many scientific limitations to the home DNA test. “These companies aren’t actually testing your ancestry at all,” says Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London. “They’re problematic in their claims to be able to infer an inidual’s ancestry.”There are a few reasons for this. First, the genetic information these DNA testing companies hold is based on living populations. When you send your spit off in a little tube, it is specific snippets, or markers, in your genome (the total collection of DNA that resides in your cells) that are being analysed, and then compared to the markers of others who are good representatives for distinct regions or ethnicities around the world. But as Thomas notes, the companies are only looking at very recent samples, from a relatively small group, in one specific database. “They are just saying: ‘If I wanted to make your genome, I could pull bits of your DNA from people all over the world who are around today. And this is just one way I could do it,’” he says.The databases are skewed towards different parts of the world, too. “23andMe has more American customers, and AncestryDNA has more British and Australian,” Thomas explains. “And none of these companies asks: ‘What do we know about the genetics of the past, and which of those past inferred genetic clusters do we get our ancestry from?’ They are giving us what the market wants, not what the genetics tells us.”There’s also the question of just how much information is passed down through a person’s DNA. Thomas explains that we probably inherit very few genes from our ancestors DNA is inherited in “chunks” that break up the further back in time you go. “You start with two parents, then four grandparents, then eight great-grandparents, it goes to 16, 32 and so on. And by the time you go 10 generations back, there are ancestors from whom you inherit no DNA.”I ask Dr Yaniv Erlich, who works for MyHeritage, how the company’s “ethnicity estimate” is created. He says they define good DNA “representatives” for English people as having “at least all of their eight great-grandparents born in England”. He believes you can “estimate that present-day iniduals probably reflect populations from about 200 to 300 years ago, as they never got DNA of any other ethnicity. Evolution is not acting fast enough to create any substantial changes.”But as the American academic Sheldon Krimsky and journalist David Cay Johnston explain in their online consumer guide, Ancestry DNA Testing And Privacy, markers maketh the result. “Today’s markers do not necessarily match the markers of 400 years ago, during the African colonisation and enslavement period,” they write. In other words, markers are inconsistent sometimes they’re passed on and sometimes they’re not. There might be a lot of genetic markers Nigerians share, for example, but that are not necessarily exclusive to them.Thomas tells me it is very possible that my birth father could be from anywhere, but have parents or grandparents who are Nigerian, or are from a “combination of countries with broad genetic similarities to Nigerians”.The bigger question is, how much should we connect geography and identity anyway? An inidual’s “ethnicity” is largely based on their own perception of cultural and social traits, not which geopolitical borders they were born between. And there aren’t universal genetic traits within certain groups, Thomas points out.“Let’s be honest, these companies are using ethnicity as a nice, polished euphemism for race, and they’re trying to define biological races using this genetic data. That in itself is shifty,” he says. “If genetics has taught us one thing over 30 years or so, it’s that there are no clearcut biological racial categories. Everyone in the world is racialised in some way. But rather than overturning these outdated notions of race, these companies are servicing them instead – presumably because they get better profits.”When I ask the home-testing sites about linking the language of ethnicity to science, they offer varying responses. An AncestryDNA spokesperson told me that “analysing DNA to determine a person’s ethnic breakdown is at the cutting edge of science”, explaining that they have “thousands” of DNA samples from around the world. “Each is from a specific location and most are accompanied by a documented family tree indicating deep heritage in a particular region.” A 23andMe spokesperson tells me the company does “not refer to ethnicity” in its analysis, instead calling it an “ancestry composition”. Yaniv Erlich of MyHeritage says: “Ethnicity is not encoded in someone’s genes, but this human-made construct can be in correlation with genetic variations. We use this correlation to infer the ethnicity.”After I got over the initial shock of my own test results, I began to explore the rest of the MyHeritage site. I was amazed to find that I could contact a fourth cousin on my biological father’s side – my first black relative – and that she lived in the same city as me. We plan to meet up, and my quest to find out more about my biology continues.But I know that decoding my DNA is only one chapter of my history. Ancestry is a legacy, not a bloodline. Our genetic script may be one of the most valuable things we own, but it’s never the whole story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6730a49a419008421d7d5620d2cc60cdc386e2b/0_442_4286_2572/master/4286.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3fb2fa3bf4d266660012e94d75f906","title":"yotam ottolenghi revamped british classic recipes","story":"Make over a prawn cocktail with a crispy twist, swap coronation chicken for chickpeas or recreate a famous lolly with these updated dishesMy take on three British summer classics is as eccentric as they come. The coronation chicken doesn’t include chicken, the seafood cocktail has got way too many ingredients, and the pudding is a homemade Solero, an ice-cream introduced by Walls in 1994 (– delicious, but scarcely old enough to qualify as a classic). I hope you’ll forgive such transgressions, because all three are deliciously summery and, in my book, British enough.My son gave these two thumbs up, which is high praise indeed.

Warm for about five minutes, whisking gently until the sugar and cornflour dissolve. Leave to cool, then transfer to the fridge to chill.Meanwhile, put the mango, the remaining 40g sugar and the peaches in a blender and blitz smooth. Tip into a bowl, stir in the passion fruit pulp and refrigerate to chill.Put the chilled cream mix and the creme fraiche in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip on a medium speed to very soft peaks – you don’t want to whip it too much: it shouldn’t be stiff and you should be able to spoon it easily into the moulds.To assemble the lollies, pour alternating large spoonfuls of the cream and fruit mixtures into the moulds to create a ripple, tie-dye effect. Tap the moulds a few times to make sure they are completely filled with the mixture and there are no gaps or air pockets, then freeze until solid – at least five hours, or overnight. To release, dip the moulds in hot water and gently pull out the lollies.This marie rose sauce is made with seriously charred chillies and tomatoes, and a whole garlic head. They give it a particular depth that I love, and you can use it with all kinds of cooked vegetables and meats. The seafood cocktail also works perfectly fine without it, though you can also serve the cocktail with a commercial tomato or chilli sauce.Prep 15 minCook 40 minServes 4 as a starterFor the marie rose sauce1 small garlic bulb, the top fifth cut off to expose the clovesFlaked sea salt and pepper180g cherry tomatoes4 large red chillies1 tbsp maple syrup2 tsp Worcestershire sauce½ tsp chipotle powder (or smoked paprika)60g mayonnaiseFor the fried seafood60g panko breadcrumbs40g desiccated coconut40g sesame seeds10g black sesame seeds2 makrut lime leaves, pulled off stalks and finely chopped (optional)100g plain flour2 eggs, beaten200g squid tubes, cleaned, patted dry and cut into 6cm x 3cm rectangles250g raw large king prawns, patted dry600ml vegetable oil1 red chilli, finely julienned1 spring onion, finely julienned1 lime – zest finely grated, to get ½ tsp, then cut into wedges, to serveStart with the sauce. Heat the oven to 230C450Fgas 8. Sprinkle the garlic bulb with some salt and pepper, wrap tightly in foil and put on an oven tray lined with baking paper alongside the tomatoes and chillies. Roast for 20 minutes, until the vegetables begin to blacken and blister, then remove from the oven. When cool enough to handle, squeeze the garlic cloves into the small bowl of a food processor, and discard the papery skins. Add the chillies (deseeded, if you don’t like too much heat), tomatoes, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle powder and half a teaspoon of flaked salt, and blitz to combine. Leave to cool completely, mix in the mayonnaise and refrigerate.While the garlic is roasting, mix the panko in a bowl with the coconut, sesame seeds, lime leaves (if using), a teaspoon of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper. In a second bowl, mix the flour with two teaspoons of flaked salt and plenty of pepper. Put the eggs in a third, shallow bowl.Set a metal rack over a tray, then prepare the seafood. Dip the squid and prawns first in the flour, then the egg and finally the panko mixture, shaking off any excess as you go, then lay on the rack while you coat the rest of the seafood.Heat the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high flame and have ready a large tray covered with plenty of kitchen paper. Once the oil is very hot, fry the chillies and spring onions for about two minutes, stirring them with a slotted spoon until crisp and golden brown, then transfer to the lined tray and sprinkle with a little flaked salt.Fry the squid and prawns in batches, so you don’t overcrowd the pan. Drop each piece carefully into the oil and fry for one to two minutes on each side, until golden brown and very crisp. Transfer to the lined tray as you go, and sprinkle with flaked salt.When you’re ready to serve, arrange the fried seafood on a platter and sprinkle over the lime zest, fried chilli and spring onions. Serve with the marie rose sauce and lime wedges.There are many points of difference that distinguish this salad from the original coronation chicken that inspired it, but the sweet-savoury creaminess that makes the original so loved (or loathed) is still here and makes this, at least for me, a perfectly satisfying summer meal.

He is also a vocal supporter of the British far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Last year Cottrell and two other men were convicted of inciting contempt and ridicule of Muslims after they made a video in which they beheaded a dummy with a toy sword outside a city council office.None of this, however, was made clear to viewers. Instead his interviewer, the former politician Adam Giles, gave Cottrell free rein to call for the reclamation of a “traditional Australian identity” by restricting immigration to people who are “culturally similar” to white Australians.He urged a ban on migrants from predominantly black African countries, saying Australia should limit its migrant intake to white South African farmers.The multinational financial firm American Express pulled its advertising, stating that “recent content on the channel does not reflect our brand values”. It was followed by Huggies nappies, Specsavers opticians and, on Friday, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.At the same time, a minister in Victoria announced she was banning the broadcasting of Sky at train stations throughout the state. A former federal government minister quit as a commentator for the channel, saying the decision to broadcast the Cottrell interview was “another step in a journey to normalising racism and bigotry in our country”.Sky’s position on Australian television screens has faced increasing scrutiny since it was wholly taken over by Murdoch’s News Corp in December 2016.Like its UK cousin, Sky is Australia’s major cable news network. Its daytime programming is predominantly dedicated to breaking news, and the network hosts a long list of high-profile and respected journalists.However, in Australia the channel has developed something of a Jekyll and Hyde character, becoming a dedicated home for provocateurs keen to make headlines in the crowded rightwing commentariat. Since the takeover there has been increasing talk of the “Foxification” of the network.“When the sun goes down at Sky, weird things come out to play,” the media academic Margaret Simons said.The Cottrell controversy followed an increasingly familiar pattern for the network.Last month David Leyonhjelm – a pro-gun, pro-free-market senator – caused outrage after he suggested to fellow politician Sarah Hanson-Young should “stop shagging men”.During a follow-up appearance on Sky he said said the senator was “known for liking men” and that “the rumours about her in Parliament House are well known”.Hanson-Young, a member of the leftwing Australian Greens, accused Leyonhjelm of “slut-shaming” her and has filed a defamation suit.In both the Cottrell and Leyonhjelm cases the network apologised, while its senior journalists strongly criticised the conduct.The Sky reporter Laura Jayes labelled Cottrell “a far-rightwing fascist”, while her colleague David Speers said it was wrong to have broadcast the interview.Despite the apologies, Sky hosts many conservative commentators who regularly push the line of decency.Its chief night-time ratings draw is Andrew Bolt, who last week wrote an article arguing that a “tidal wave” of migrants was swamping Australia, forming enclaves and “changing our culture”.Bolt regularly faces opprobrium for his views on immigration and Indigenous Australians. In 2011, he was found to have breached racial discrimination laws in two 2009 articles which implied light-skinned people who identified as Aboriginal did so for personal gain.And there are others. Last year Sky was forced to sack Mark Latham, a former Labor party leader turned rightwing outrage merchant, after he made a string of controversial statements, including speculating about the sexuality of a high school student. However the critic of what he has described as Australia’s “Muslim problem” still appears as a guest on several of the network’s programmes.Last week the race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, said racial fear was being monetised by “sections of a fracturing media industry” they were using racial controversies “as part of their business model” to grab attention and keep their audiences.Peter Fray, a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald and now a journalism academic, said the channel had seen a space in Australia’s media market for rightwing commentary.“I think what they’re tapping into is a relatively cheap strain of broadly rightwing commentary which has clearly gone too far with the Cottrell thing,” he said.“Is that monetising racism? It’s a good question. I think you could make that argument, but I don’t think it’s deliberate. I think what’s happening is they are giving some presenters a free rein to do what they do best, or worst, and you’re seeing that play out.”Simons, an associate professor in journalism at Monash University, is sceptical of how deliberate the strategy is at Sky.“There’s certainly a pattern of behaviour here but I don’t think we should conclude that it’s some kind of conspiracy where the News Corp heads are sitting back and planning the Blair Cottrell thing, because it has been incredibly damaging for them,” she said.“Frankly if they are doing it for that reason they’re failing because those programmes rate terribly.”According to the Australian ratings agency, Oztam, Bolt’s programme is watched by about 31,000 viewers. The figures for Outsiders – the programme on which Leyonhjelm appeared – rose from 17,000 in 2017 to 29,000 in the first half of 2018.By comparison, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s flagship nightly current affairs programme, 7.30, is viewed by about 600,000 people.But that could be about to change. This week Sky announced a partnership with the regional broadcaster Win. The deal will mean Sky’s daytime news – and night-time commentary – will have a potential audience of 8 million across Win’s network covering most of regional Australia.“It means people in those areas will get another competent national news service, but what impact the other Sky content will have on those regional markets we don’t know,” Simons said.But, she added: “I imagine it would be a boreathon for most people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9000cc885b49bbe85c156a02f299223b9a60bdd7/1114_108_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9ad8d8a5c186ea8c16859488c3558e","title":"uktv channels to return to virgin media","story":"Dave, Gold and other channels to reappear after companies reach agreementVirgin Media users will get back UKTV channels, including Dave and Gold, after the two companies reached an agreement, it has been announced.Customers lost all 23 of UKTV’s channels last month in a row over fees but the channels that were removed had already started to reappear, Virgin Media said on Saturday.David Bouchier, the firm’s chief digital entertainment officer, said: “Reaching this agreement reaffirms our longstanding partnership with UKTV and is fantastic news for our customers.“They can enjoy channels like Dave and Gold once again, including in HD, and also get more UKTV on-demand programming than ever before.” He said other channels that had been added to Virgin TV recently would remain. “We are sorry for what we know has been a frustrating time for our customers, but are pleased that our TV bundles are now even bigger.” Simon Michaelides, the chief commercial officer at UKTV, said: “Viewers are at the heart of UKTV and we want to thank them for all of their support. “We know this has created real disruption for some of our viewers and we’re so sorry for this, but we are thrilled to be back, broadcasting our channels and shows to customers of Virgin Media once more.”A statement to customers on UKTV’s Twitter page said thousands of viewers’ messages calling for the return of its channels to Virgin Media had been read and responded to. “We’re so sorry it’s taken both companies this long, and has caused disruption to so many people … "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a83fa43e7c3e46fb20d833e6c58dd0bd56c063/0_244_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3f5f21497fa2c05de1877290e2ee844","title":"women long distance commuters mothers","story":"Three women reveal the benefits and pitfalls of travelling long distances to work, while their partners look after the childrenNice, France, to London every week“I pinch myself every time I drive the kids to school on a Friday, when I see the glorious view of the Mediterranean sea from the school gate, before heading off on a hike in the mountains with the dog,” says Kate Simon. She lives in Nice, southern France, with her husband, Antoine, and their two primary school-aged children, and this was exactly the lifestyle they had in mind when they migrated from Buckinghamshire, eight years ago.To make their dream a reality, Kate had to commit to working Monday to Thursday in London, continuing with her senior marketing role.“I didn’t decide to be a long-distance commuter,” she says, “it was a byproduct of a move that was designed to provide a different lifestyle for us as a family. My husband and I had good jobs and a lovely life but we found ourselves asking: ‘Is this it?’ – commuting into\u0026nbspLondon, with the stress of rushing home at the end of the day to see the kids, aged four and two, before bedtime.”In France, Kate’s husband runs his holiday rentals and seasonal property management business mostly from home, so that he can look after the children when they are not at school. His mother also relocated to Nice, and helps with\u0026nbspchildcare.Knowing that her children are being raised by family rather than a nanny, are bilingual and have access to a wonderful life – skiing in winter, beach in summer – helps, but Kate still finds it hard being separated from them when she’s in London. “If the kids are ill or there’s a family emergency, the distance feels very real,” she says.However, she earns significantly more than she would if she worked locally, and it still makes financial sense to work this way, even with the additional overheads of their flat\u0026nbspin London.“The cost of living is higher in France,” Kate says. “But the commuting costs are actually cheaper now. I spend less per week doing a round trip from Nice to Gatwick than it used to cost to take the train from Leighton Buzzard to Euston every day, with car parking.” She says, however, that the family has been hit by the post-Brexit exchange rate, which is costing her several hundred pounds a month, as\u0026nbspshe is paid in pounds, while home expenditure is in euros.What she finds most infuriating about her work-life arrangement, though, is judgment from others. “There have been a range of comments from outright sexism to veiled horror that a woman could be doing something as outrageous as being away from her children during the week,” she says.But she is pleased she is doing her bit for feminism. “I know we’re in the minority in terms of role reversal, but for us this is a benefit. I like to think that we’re showing our son and daughter that mums can be career-oriented and professionally successful, and dads can be caregivers and homemakers. Life choices should not be defined by\u0026nbspgender.”The TUC believe the increase is down to people being priced out by unaffordable housing, and an inefficient transport system. But it seems the promise of a more wholesome, outdoors lifestyle – alongside a London income – is also a draw for some.Belfast to LondonKatie Scott and her husband, Jonny, left London for Northern Ireland, with their baby, in search of fresh air, green space and to be closer to Jonny’s parents. They rented out their two-bed flat in Brixton and now\u0026nbsplive in a lovely cottage surrounded by woodland, a river and fields.Initially Katie was working for Cancer Research UK in Belfast, commuting for an hour and a half each way, five days a week – with trips to London twice a month. But on returning after having their second baby, she was promoted to a role that involved travelling two-three days a week to the head office in Angel, north London.“I do the five-hour each way commute because it keeps me working for a large national charity,” she says. “The job market in Northern Ireland is completely different and charity jobs aren’t well\u0026nbsppaid, so I get the benefit of a London salary and much lower living costs.”Katie tries to condense her working days in London to avoid commuting back and forth in a day, and travel expenses are covered by her employer, so she is no worse off\u0026nbspfinancially.She stays with a friend or family member for two nights a week, which also enables her to catch up with her own family, who are mostly based in London. Once she is back in Northern Ireland, working from home, she is around for her children, making it to parent-teacher meetings or sports day, and doing the school drop-off and collection.“Seeing the kids running out in the garden or on the beach – 30\u0026nbspminutes away – makes all the travel worthwhile,” she says.Glasgow to LondonMay Rosenthal began a long-distance commute for different reasons. She lives in Glasgow, where\u0026nbspshe studied at university and has lived ever since, and gets the four-and-a-half-hour train to London early on Monday morning, returning home to her partner and\u0026nbspfour-year-old son late on a Thursday evening.Rather than craving a more idyllic\u0026nbsplifestyle, it was a dream job offer, as a researcher for the Victoria\u0026nbspand Albert Museum, that lured May back to London, where she grew up, to live and work part of\u0026nbspthe week.She worries about the impact of her choices on the rest of the family. “I’ve been doing the commute for a year and a half, and it now feels like we have a really good rhythm and balance but early on it was tough on\u0026nbspour son who got quite upset about it. And for my partner, it has definitely added pressure – in terms of having to deal with both the practical and emotional aspects of\u0026nbspraising our son.“We FaceTime twice a day, which really helps, but even that requires extra organisation from my partner, making sure there’s time to do it before and after nursery.”Financially it’s difficult but that’s more to do with working in a low-paid sector, says May.

In just three seconds ...Baby One More Time, which turns 20 this year, announced the arrival of a new superstar: the then 16-year-old ex-Mouseketeer from Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney Jean Spears. Along with its equally iconic high school-set music video it re-turfed pop, kickstarting an entire sound (think funk-tinged R\u0026ampB grooves mixed with Abba melodies), sweeping aside the dregs of grunge (sorry, Bush) and US heartland rock (bye, Hootie \u0026amp the Blowfish), revitalising pop radio and MTV in the process, before cementing its songwriter and co-producer Max Martin as one of modern music’s most influential exponents. In the space of just three minutes and 31 seconds, Spears launched millennial teen pop, fusing family-friendly, girl-next-door fun with good old fashioned controversy, forging a template for those who followed.While TLC interpreted the lyrics as alluding to domestic violence, they actually represented Martin’s attempts at American slang, believing “hit me” could seamlessly replace “call me”. The song was then offered to fellow Swede, Robyn, whom Martin had already worked with on two US top 10 singles (Do You Know (What It Takes) and Show Me Love, both released in 1997), but again nothing came of it. According to Tim Bower’s 2012 book, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, the song had one further dalliance with a pop act other than Britney. The story goes that after hearing Martin’s demo of what had now been renamed …Baby One More Time, Cowell demanded he have the song for his latest boyband, UK rabble Five. Martin had already co-written Five’s debut single, Slam Dunk (Da Funk) alongside his mentor, the late Denniz Pop, but declined Cowell’s request, saying it had already been earmarked for Spears. “You’re mad,” Cowell is reported to have said. “No one can be successful with a name like that.” As a last gasp attempt, Cowell offered Martin a new Merc 500SL in return for the song. “It costs £95,000,” he added.It was …Baby One More Time that convinced Spears of the merits of pop. She initially saw herself as making “Sheryl Crow music, but younger”, while Larry Rudolph, an entertainment lawyer friend of Spears’s mum Lynne who had been tasked with getting her signed (he’s now her manager), had her record a clutch of songs originally recorded by Toni Braxton. It was those recordings that lead to auditions for Mercury, Epic and Jive (the first two labels said no she signed with the latter) which included Spears covering Whitney Houston’s version of I Will Always Love You. With the more R\u0026ampB-leaning early material not working, and with a clause allowing Jive to terminate her contract after 90 days if they felt an album wasn’t on the horizon, A\u0026ampR Steve Lunt approached Martin, who had already delivered success for Jive’s boyband the Backstreet Boys. A meeting was set up with Spears in New York. “I was pretty young at the time, so I was nervous,” she says, “but he was so nice and put me right at ease.” For Martin, his song had finally found its home.From New York, Spears de-camped to Martin’s Cheiron studios in Stockholm to start recording. “I remember being so in awe of Stockholm,” Spears says. “I was out there for, like, 10 days, but we were so busy in the studio I didn’t have time to go out and explore on that first trip.” The song’s co-producer Rami Yacoub remembers Spears as “very shy and super sweet – I mean she was a kid and we had no idea there was a beast of an artist lurking under that innocent look”. The sessions were intense, with four of the album’s five singles recorded in that time. In 2001, Martin referred to the Cheiron sound as “direct, effective, we don’t show off”, words reiterated by Yacoub. “A song that sounds simple is not simple to make. It’s all about the taste and making sure you don’t add more than what the song needs.”For Spears, working with perfectionists suited her. “I really respect that when I’m working with him,” she says. “I think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.”Another person to witness firsthand this studied effortlessness was Nana Hedin, a backing vocalist who had previously worked with Denniz Pop on songs by Dr Alban, whose 1992 hit It’s My Life soundtracked a Tampax advert in the UK. Pop recommended Hedin to Martin, who brought her onboard for …Baby One More Time. “I remember I thought the song was for teenagers but the production was filled with a grown-up attitude and sounds that I really liked,” she says. “I was so impressed by how a guy like Max could write lyrics that got into the hearts and spoke to the teenage thinking.” Occasionally, Hedin would record her backing vocals first, before the artist arrived, but with …Baby One More Time Spears’s vocals were already recorded. “I tried to sound exactly like her,” she laughs. “It was hard, but a lot of fun. I’m like a parrot in many ways. I try to get the same vibe and use the exact same pronunciation as the artist. In one harmony, each take is different I sing very high, in another I use powerful belting, the next I’m whispering and sometimes I even pinch my nose for a sharper sound.”With Britney’s vocals recorded in March, and the song finished shortly after (“It took probably around two to three weeks to finish,” says Yacoub), Spears headed out on a summer tour, taking in 26 shopping malls. Aware that they had a potential hit on their hands, Jive sent reps out to meet with the influential US radio programme directors ahead of the song’s October release. “The label guy brought in a video featuring Britney rehearsing dance moves to the song,” remembers Clarke Ingram, then operations manager and program director of New York’s Top 40 radio station WPXY. “This had the desired effect of showing me that Britney had star quality, in addition to having a potential hit record. We went to lunch afterwards, and I committed to adding the song at that time.” In fact, Ingram is pretty sure he was the first person to play the song on US radio. “No other station would have heard it any earlier, and I know of no station that played it before we did.” For Ingram, …Baby One More Time represented the holy grail: a song pop radio could fully own. “We’d been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-90s, and something of an R\u0026ampB cycle after that,” he explains. “Britney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. The song hit the centre of the Top 40 audience, and it proved that by its performance, both on the air and off.”The song sold 500,000 copies on its first day of release in the US, eventually peaking at No 1. It reached No 1 in every single country it charted in, and was 1999’s biggest-selling song in the UK with 1.4m copies sold. A megastar had been created seemingly overnight. “I don’t think we understood what we had done,” Martin said in a 2008 Swedish radio documentary. “I remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No 1 in the USA … I had so much going on I didn’t really grasp the meaning of it”. He even forgot to tell Yacoub. “Max walked into the studio one day while I was working and said: ‘Hey man, by the way, we are No 1 in America,’” he recalls. “I asked him when it had happened and he said: ‘Three weeks ago.’ We really didn’t focus on charts, we just kept working.” Even celebrations were muted. “It was on a Tuesday, I believe: an early dinner, a cigar, and to bed at 11pm as we had work the next day.”An iconic song needed an iconic video. Unfortunately, director Nigel Dick’s original concept was deemed a dud by Spears. “I wrote an idea which sucked, so the label put me back on the phone with Britney who told me she wanted to make a video where she was stuck in a classroom thinking about boys and we took it from there,” Dick writes on the harangued-sounding FAQ section of his website. He also states the school uniform look, augmented by plaited bunches and bare midriff, was Spears’s idea too. What seems relatively tame now caused uproar in a bubblegum pop era that, via shows like MTV’s popular Total Request Live, was being fed directly into family homes.The video, an instant pop culture moment that gave Spears all-important tabloid notoriety, also fused in the public consciousness with David LaChapelle’s controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot featuring Spears lying on her childhood bed in her underwear clutching a Teletubby. Suddenly, the now turbo-charged teen pop genre had its flag bearer, one whose identity – sweet southern belle in the video for soft-focus follow-up single Sometimes red PVC-clad dominatrix in the “not that innocent” Oops!…I Did It Again visual – was malleable enough to, at least initially, be everything all at once. How does Spears feel about the song almost 20 years later? “Wow, that went quick. It was such a fun and crazy time, it was a bit of a blur.” Britney Spears plays Open Air Theatre, Scarborough, Friday 17 August touring to 1 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2737d6dbf83bd810dca284cb0f07d126a64703bd/42_415_5240_3144/master/5240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67831407b899048c851300f03c83f4ed","title":"campaign for second brexit vote seeks support beyond capital","story":"People’s Vote roadshow will try to show public that remainers are not part of establishmentCampaigners for a second referendum will hold the first of a series of events outside London on Saturday to try to mobilise popular support for the plan beyond the capital.The Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Vince Cable, and Labour’s Stephen Doughty will address a lunchtime event at the Colston Hall in Bristol, where tickets have sold out.Organised by the People’s Vote campaign, it will be followed by events in Edinburgh, Newcastle, Cambridge and Cardiff before culminating in marches to coincide with the Labour party conference in Liverpool and the Conservative conference in Birmingham.A local doctor and a 20-year-old gardener will be among those speaking in Bristol, as the organisers try to show that those in favour of Britain staying in the European Union no longer represent the establishment – an elitist charge that was successfully used by the Brexiters during the referendum campaign.A source at the People’s Vote campaign said the organisation wanted to try to “give voice to millions of people who feel the establishment has screwed Brexit up over the past two years” and argue that “the likes of Michael Gove are the establishment now”.However, there has been a resurgence in activity by Conservative hard Brexit campaigners, who are unhappy at Theresa May’s Chequers compromise proposals, under which the UK would share a common regulatory rulebook with the EU on food and goods after leaving the EU.A new online campaign, Stand Up 4 Brexit, which supporters say is in favour of a clean Brexit, has rapidly grown in support in the past week, winning the endorsement of pro-Brexit MPs such as Priti Patel and Ben Bradley.Paul Everitt-Clay, a Tory activist, said: “We are encouraging people to speak out and reject the Chequers plans. They amount to a removal of every single one of Theresa May’s negotiating red lines, because we will be making ongoing payments to the EU, still be bound by its rules, and reintroducing free movement by another name.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/482d40a57c3e8e7073d701f86c189ab0f208b3cc/0_403_6091_3655/master/6091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=741439616f03404881193808b708cd6d","title":"women equal to men science fact book angela saini","story":"When young men and women come up against sexist stereotypes masquerading as science, Angela Saini wants them to be armed with the facts. “I call my book ammunition,” she says of her 288-page prize-winning work Inferior: The True Power of Women and the Science that Shows It. “There are people out there who insist that somehow the inequalities we see in society are not just because of historic discrimination, but also because of biology – the idea that there are factors within us that will cause men or women to be better at some things than others.”She wrote Inferior to demonstrate that “actually, science doesn’t support that point of view. I think it’s important we understand these scientific facts. We need that ammunition to counter the weird mistruths that are circulating within and outside science about sex difference”.To female scientists fed up with being treated as though their brains are the odd exceptions among their sex, Inferior is more than just a book. It’s a battle cry – and right now, it is having a galvanising effect on its core fanbase. On 31 July a crowdfunding campaign to send a copy of Inferior to every mixed secondary school in England with more than 1,000 pupils was launched by Dr Jessica Wade, a British physicist who writes 270 Wikipedia pages a year to raise the profile of female scientists. Within two days the campaign had raised £2,000. Yesterday it reached its original £15,000 target and was powering its way towards £20,000 – a figure which would allow the book to be sent to every state school in the country.“There’s nothing you want more than for people to be inspired by your work,” says Saini, 37, a multiple award-winning science journalist, who first became intrigued by sex difference research when she wrote about the menopause for the Observer. “What Jess is doing means such a lot to me. I hope if my book can empower her, it can empower other young women, and men, too.”The key message she hopes her readers will take away is that nothing in science suggests equality is not possible. “We are not as different as the inequalities in our society makes us believe we are. Even now, there are people saying we shouldn’t be pushing for gender equality because we’re never going to see it for biological reasons.” For example, many people think there are large psychological differences in spatial awareness, mathematical reasoning or verbal skills between men and women. “Actually, those differences are tiny, a fraction of a standard deviation,” says Saini. “Psychologically, the differences between the sexes are not enough to account for the inequalities we see in our society today.”Inferior is not a children’s book by any stretch of the imagination. It includes a firsthand account of female genital mutilation and deliberately examines a large number of academic studies in painstaking detail. But, like recent bestselling children’s books Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls and Fantastically Great Women Who Changed the World, it could play a valuable role in breaking down gender stereotypes for the next generation of would-be scientists and mathematicians, and Saini is confident many teenagers will engage with it. “Girls and boys aged 13 or 14 upwards have really responded to the message, and the earlier we can get this message to them, the better.” She was the only girl in science and maths classes at school. “Even if it’s not overtly stated to you, just being in a minority – especially a minority of one – makes you think maybe there are some differences between the sexes.”Researching and writing the book has totally changed how she feels about herself, destroying her own “subconscious stereotypes” about women. “It made me look at the world differently. That’s the power of science.”In one of the most shocking chapters, Saini relays a letter written by Charles Darwin in which he argues that women are intellectually inferior to men. “He was looking at society. He saw women weren’t achieving as much and he treated us almost the way you would treat observations of lions or peacocks in the wild. He thought: this reflects the biological facts.”Even at the time, contemporary female intellectuals pointed out that this theory ignored a lot of obvious historical and cultural factors, but Darwin failed to take on board their arguments. “It was quite lazy of him, which is surprising, because he wasn’t a lazy scientist. He was usually so painstaking and thorough.”But she still admires him for everything he got right. “Even the best scientists can fall into this trap of looking at the world around them and thinking: things are the way they are because of nature.” After all, she points out, assuming 19th-century scientists could be biased but 21st-century scientists never are makes no sense. “That’s why, in the book, I look not just at the science, but at the scientists.”These range from Kristen Hawkes, whose research suggesting postmenopausal women played a vital role in increasing the human life has been met with dogged resistance from some male scientists, to Robert Trivers who, Saini shows, used evidence from a flawed 1948 experiment on fruit flies when he famously argued that men are more naturally promiscuous than women. “A lot of people – especially scientists – view science as perfectly objective and rational. But the questions researchers choose to ask, and the answers they come up with, are heavily affected by their prior assumptions.” At times, the book shows a staggering lack of respect from male scientists towards the work of their female contemporaries. “Science won’t improve unless we understand that we all have biases and those biases affect research,” says Saini.Since it was published in 2017, her book has sold 20,000 copies, won Physics World Book of the Year and triggered a worldwide “STEMinist” book club movement among feminist scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians. Saini says she has even had positive feedback about it from James Damore, a Google software engineer who made headlines last year when he wrote an internal memo arguing biological differences were the reason behind the low number of women in tech. “We need scientific arguments to counter those politically motivated statements,” she says. “These arguments matter personally, in terms of how we think about ourselves, but also politically. We cannot afford to be complacent. There are movements around the world that are trying to take back the rights of women – rights our mothers and grandmothers fought so hard for. We can take anything for granted.”Wade says the book gave her “all this power. You read it and you have evidence. You can debate it”. She set up the crowdfunding campaign because she suspected private girls’ schools would be buying it for their libraries, and wanted state school students to have the same access. “Reading this book when doing your GCSEs or A levels is the perfect time, because you’re making decisions that will impact your entire career. I want girls to recognise they can do anything.”The actor Daniel Radcliffe, a childhood friend of Wade, is planning to release a video in support of the crowdfunding campaign this week. He describes Inferior as “a truly mind-blowing book”, which has made him completely reevaluate his understanding of the world.“As many people as possible should have access to this book, and I am certain Jessie – who has always been the smartest person I know – is going to make that happen,” he says.Saini, a Londoner with Indian parentage, is working on her next book on the science of race. “Race science is more taboo, but the way prejudice plays out within the research illuminates similar issues as those of Inferior.”Despite the sexism and racism she has documented in science, she feels positive about the future. “If we catch children early, we can achieve enormous change. I don’t think anyone is born with prejudices. I’m optimistic.” She points out that, historically, male scientists gained their power by excluding women from clubs, societies and institutes. “Now women are forming their own networks. And there’s no limit to what we can achieve.”Myth There is such a thing as a typical male brain and a typical female brain from birthFact Research has found that only the tiniest gaps, if any, exist between boys’ and girls’ fine motor skills, ability to perform mental rotations, spatial visualisation, mathematical ability, verbal fluency and vocabulary. Under normal conditions, large gaps between boys and girls haven’t been found by scientists studying the typical development of babies. In fact, the overlap between the sexes is so huge that scientists have struggled to find and replicate results that suggest there is any real gap at all.Myth Men are better at carrying out a single task, while women are better at multitaskingFact In 2013 this claim was put forward in a press release summarising an important study by the scientist Ruben Gur on the brain wiring differences between the sexes, but was not detailed in the study itself. In conversations with Saini documented in Inferior, Gur said he hadn’t seen any scientific evidence to support this claim, and he’s not sure how it made it into the press release.Myth Women are naturally less intelligent than men because their brains are smaller and lighter Fact Men do, on average, have slightly bigger heads and slightly bigger brains than women. But as the trailblazing intellectual Helen Hamilton Gardener pointed out in the 19th century, it is the ratio of body size to brain size that is important. Otherwise, as she put it, “an elephant would be able to out-think all of us”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e900aa0722215e086422a228b901b92c009f80/0_1_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49435e036dcae4ecd398a500475149d2","title":"tented britain rise in rough sleepers taking shelter under canvas","story":"UK may not have tent cities like US, but encampments have become feature of British lifeSun-bleached food packaging and the fading remnants of a campfire are the only clues that people used to live in woodland near Cardiff Bay. Residents nearby said the homeless men living in Hamadryad Park had left shortly after Aaron French-Willcox, 19, was found cold and unresponsive in a tent at an encampment in the early hours of 13 February.French-Wilcox, who had type one diabetes and died from diabetic ketoacidosis, started living in one of the three tents at the site after he was reportedly caught taking the synthetic cannabinoid spice at a homeless shelter three weeks before his death. “He didn’t belong out here,” said a Cardiff rough sleeper who knew him. “He was a nice guy. Goodhearted. Just a decent 19-year-old.” The teenager was one of a growing number of homeless people in temporary and semi-permanent encampments throughout the UK, in what has become an increasingly common fixture of British life, living underneath bridges, clearings in woodland and quieter corners of city centres. The official rough sleeper count in England – widely considered a big underestimate – has strict rules about what constitutes a rough sleeper. People living in encampments are not necessarily included in the 4,751 people who bedded down outside overnight in 2017. The government is expected to release its strategy for tackling street homelessness within the next few days. The strategy aims to halve rough sleeping by 2021 and eliminate it by 2027.In the past year, encampments of varying sizes have been reported in cities and towns including Bristol, Milton Keynes, Cardiff, Manchester, Oxford, Sheffield, London, Northampton, Cambridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Glasgow and Exeter.Police and councils are often quick to try to break up encampments and move people on using enforcement orders and public space protection orders (PSPOs).In the centre of Slough, eight homeless people camping outside a Catholic church have been issued with a notice to vacate by the local diocese. A church volunteer told local media that members of the congregation had complained about the encampment and said the group were “intimidating”.Last month, 10 police officers broke up a camp on the banks of the Severn near Worcester Cathedral where about half a dozen rough sleepers had been living. Days later, former camp members were reportedly seen sleeping rough in the city centre. Homeless encampments are also entering popular culture. For the first time in the soap’s 57-year history, Coronation Street is running a storyline on homelessness in which the longtime character Sean Tully experiences cashflow problems and ends up living at a homeless camp underneath railway arches. Matt Downie, the director of policy at Crisis, said: “People living in tents and cars and squats and various different forms of homelessness should just be viewed as part of the homeless population. To a large extent, the problem should be viewed as simply another form of rough sleeping.“It’s true that it’s an underrepresented group. We are pretty confident that the numbers of people experiencing those forms of homelessness aren’t picked up, particularly in the rough sleeping statistics.”Downie said a future in which US-style tent cities become a normal part of life in the UK would be “unimaginable”, but warned that more and more people would be forced to live on the streets and in encampments unless government policy changed.Last summer, Milton Keynes hit the headlines when more than 60 tents were pitched in underpasses and on the streets, many inhabited by low-wage workers, former soldiers and people with mental health issues. Milton Keynes council said it has since had success in housing the town’s rough sleepers. It said the number had fallen to just under 50, with 14 tents still standing in July. The council credited a partnership between homelessness organisations, police and other services to help house people, using charities with existing links to rough sleepers to get people into emergency accommodation. Peter Marland, the leader of the council, said higher rents and government cuts were the main drivers of the encampments. “A lot of this is to do with service cuts, whether that be the NHS, the police, some council services, those support services that were previously there if you had a drug or alcohol addiction,” he said.“With austerity, we’ve seen a lot of those services go away because homelessness had seemed to go away, but obviously what a lot of those support services were doing is keeping people away from being homeless.”At the start of the year, the Labour council launched a housing first scheme, which offers rough sleepers long-term secure accommodation alongside support services, which Marland said had helped get more than 50 people off the street. “Milton Keynes in a way is different. We’ve overtaken Liverpool and Sheffield in terms of our economy size. In becoming a big city, it means you get big city problems,” he said.“Quite early, we ruled out PSPOs. We didn’t want to criminalise the act of being homeless. Nobody wakes up in the morning and says: ‘I’m going to live in a tent.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c99c539071fe84c3ba44df2857ae50fd89c1e38/0_321_5656_3393/master/5656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f707ae80bf763b33958f8fcaa603af1","title":"toronto wolfpack super league qualifiers","story":"After 18 relatively trouble-free months the biggest challenge in Toronto Wolfpack’s short history begins this weekend. Rugby league’s transatlantic trailblazers have made light work of the professional game so far since their inaugural game in February 2017 winning League One at a canter last season, before finishing top of the sport’s second tier, the Championship, this time around.In any other sport a record of 21 wins from 23 games would be enough to ensure promotion but Toronto now head into the Qualifiers, the eight-team mini-league featuring Super League’s bottom four and the Championship’s leading quartet which will determine the final four places in the top flight in 2019.The top three teams after seven games automatically gain Super League status fourth and fifth play-off in the Million Pound Game for the 12th and final spot. For Toronto, that all begins this Sunday with a trip to Halifax. Martin Vickers, head of the Wolfpack’s UK operations, says: “The club is hugely excited about the next seven weeks and the chance to play some top clubs.”With the disparity in funding between the top two isions, being in Super League next season is seen as vital by some clubs but the Wolfpack, who are fortunate enough to be bankrolled by the Australian mining tycoon David Argyle, do not share that view, unsurprisingly. Vickers says: “The goal from the outset was Super League and we would love to achieve that sooner rather than later, but I wouldn’t describe being in the Championship next year as fatal. We have long-term partnerships which continue to thrive, we are collaborating strongly with local communities to get children playing rugby and we have a serious and sustainable long-term model.”The reaction in Toronto to rugby league, from schools through to match-day attendances, has been positive – and offers an insight into the potential the sport perhaps has in cracking North America. More than 8,200 fans watched their recent game against Featherstone and Vickers believes that is simply the tip of the iceberg for the years ahead.“From day one the response from the Canadian fans has been awesome,” he says. “It’s a breath of fresh air for the sport to see a huge city like Toronto embrace the game. It’s also great to see the amount of UK supporters coming to games, and the tourism board in Toronto recognise the economic impact the club is bringing to the city.”With Argyle’s backing, Toronto have not been coy in flexing their financial muscle. Established NRL players such as Darcy Lussick and Chase Stanley have arrived in Canada this year – but even with such investment promotion at this stage would be ahead of where the Wolfpack’s projected seven-year plan had them in 2019. Vickers says: “I’m fairly sure when our investment group sat down just over two years ago and put this project together, this point felt like a long time away. But it’s a great credit to everyone involved that the club has an opportunity to create history over the next few crucial weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6ba1defb614ed6fe2638d29b876e85154499c9/0_134_4617_2769/master/4617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0eae4af7537b5a4e27727494127a6f8b","title":"england v india second test day three live","story":"35th over: England 142-5 (Bairstow 25, Woakes 6) Sharma continues to target Bairstow’s inside-edge and he can’t believe he hasn’t induced a nick behind with one particular inswinger.

You read it here first.” I can see why it will irritate people, but I don’t mind it when it’s in good faith and even-handed. Root knew as soon as he did the mic-drop that it invited a retort. I think if you give it you have to be able to take it and there seems to be a good spirit in this contest so far, helped no doubt by the respect between the two skippers. 33rd over: England 137-5 (Bairstow 21, Woakes 5) Oof! First decent bouncer of the innings from Sharma and it causes Woakes all sorts of bother. Fending in front of his face the batsman is fortunate to see the ball drop off his gloves and away to safety. Sharma follows that up a couple of balls later with one that holds its line up the slope to Bairstow. India not giving up.“Hi Jonathan,” hi Simon Thomas. “Whilst doing some lunchtime research on England spinners beginning with B for my All time England ‘B’ team, I read this rather withering critique of Bobby Peel by the author of Wikipedia’s Johnny Briggs biography. Any know what he did? Pass the port the wrong way or cut the nose off the stilton maybe? “Peel was a dissolute dipsomaniac who eventually left the game after embarrassing himself”.” My dear old thing. 32nd over: England 135-5 (Bairstow 20, Woakes 4) Shami now has 3-47 from 12 excellent overs. His pace has consistently been in the high 80s mph, he’s moved the ball both ways and maintained a consistently probing line and length. He’s exposed England’s technical flaw of refusing to play straight. So many batsmen perishing or looking ungainly trying to work to leg and falling over to the off side. Woakes off the mark with a thick edge down to the vacant third man boundary. Another LBW, another partnership broken out of nowhere, and this game continues to advance at a rapid pace. Full and straight from Shami, tailing into Buttler who plays around his front pad and is not reprieved by the umpire. No reviews for England to play with, not that it would have mattered, Aleem Dar was bang on the money again. 31st over: England 131-4 (Bairstow 20, Buttler 24) Another over with an early boundary, this time Buttler carving Sharma to third-man. England’s second slip then earns a couple when he could have had more but for some excellent fielding in the covers. The scoring rate a healthy 7rpo since lunch. 30th over: England 124-4 (Bairstow 20, Buttler 17) The TV commentators are reminding viewers that when Bairstow plays with a crooked bat he is a major risk of playing on (as he almost did the previous over). Seemingly aware of the chat the Yorkshireman ks back-to-back fours off Shami with a beautifully straight blade. Two fine strokes from Bairstow to keep England’s momentum building after lunch. “With Imam ul Haq playing for Pakistan, the next time the teams meet we will have Imam v Pope. I believe Bangladesh have a player called Rabbi too,” emails Justin Rigden. Indeed they do, Kamrul Islam Rabbi.29th over: England 116-4 (Bairstow 12, Buttler 17) Sharma is spearing everything back in to England’s right-handers and he’s unlucky to see one such delivery cannon off Buttler’s inside-edge and race away to fine-leg for four, and another skim off Bairstow’s inside-egde for a single. Buttler now 17 off 14 and growing into the kind of cameo that could take this game away from India in a hurry. Mike Summers-Smith has an addition to the debutant centurion conversation. “I’ve found another trio - South Africa v. Pakistan, 1st Test 1997. Azhar Mahmood, Ali Naqvi and Mohammad Wasim. Of course, having two debutants in one innings helps the odds a bit.”28th over: England 110-4 (Bairstow 11, Buttler 12) Shami’s switched back to the nursery end he started the day at, meaning the solid Pandya has a breather. It doesn’t begin promisingly though because Bairstow presents the full face of his bat to a length delivery and watches it race past the non-striker for a dreamy four. It is a stroke that gives England the lead. 27th over: England 104-4 (Bairstow 7, Buttler 11) Sharma replaces Shami from the Pavilion end and gets some immediate movement off the seam into the right-handed Bairstow, drawing stifled screams from Indians behind the wicket. When Buttler has strike he tries to adapt to the conditions by getting a long way forward and outside off stump, Kohli responds by introducing a leg gully but he is a spectator as Buttler whips one off his pads for four. This is an excellent duel, Sharma bowling with good shape, Buttler batting with great awareness. 26th over: England 99-4 (Bairstow 6, Buttler 7) Pandya continues after lunch. He was responsible for keeping India in the hunt when Root and Pope looked to be strolling to handsome scores. He doesn’t have the desired effect here though, conceding seven runs, including a squirty four from Buttler down to third man. 25th over: England 92-4 (Bairstow 5, Buttler 1) Shami tidies up his incomplete over but true to form the two deliveries take an age. The first delivery is a no-ball for the bowler knocking the non-striker’s bails off accidentally (the Steve Finn rule), then there’s a pause for postprandial movement in the pavilion. From the deliveires both batsman nick singles as clouds roll in to dampen the brightness of the morning session. Ok, back to the action, Bairstow and Buttler are making their way out to the middle. India are in a huddle. Where will this extended afternoon session take us?“Anyone notice that when Pope got out, Kohli celebrated by mimicking Woakes’ celebration against him yesterday?” I did not, Kevin Wilson, but I’m sure it will find its way into the social media conversation if it happened. On that subject... Dave Kalucy emails from down under. “Watching this test eagerly to see what awaits my troubled nation when the Ashes resume and just had a random thought i.e. if 2020 and fifty overs are all about big hitting is it fair to say that a good Test is made by having a good bowling wicket?”What was it Richie Benaud always used to say? A good Test is when the ball is just on top of the bat. The ledger is probably a tad unbalanced in this Test but that’s been no fault of the groundsman. “Am I the only one hoping that we see Billy Stanlake bowling to Ollie Pope in the next Ashes?” asks Phil Sawyer, “Stan vs Ollie.” Also, in the comedy double act world that would also be very much little (Pope is 5ft 9) and large (Stanlake is 6ft 8).Back to slow over rates: “Giving runs to the other side is too weighted, why not only one-handed catches for an hour, or bowlers must announce their delivery before bowling? For example.” Lovely stuff, Tone White.While Tom baits and switches. “Considering all the stick India are getting for their poor over rate this morning, they’ve bowled far more than England managed by this time yesterday... Honk Honk. I’ll get my coat.”And Ian Copestake has a good old whinge. “The slow over rate really got my goat when seated at Edgbaston on the first day last time round. It was clearly deliberate and I recall it helping unseat Rashid as it took him totally out of his rhythm.”I should add, my moaning about over rates is nothing specifically to do with India, it is a global scourge, and I just happen to be on OBO duty while India are proving my point. “Pope is a bit of a fidgeter, dare I say it like Steve Smith,” emailed Matt Gilbert, when Pope was batting beautifully on debut. I must confess I never saw the resemblance, but I’ll pay closer attention in the future. His opening shot definitely had a touch of the Ponting about it. I liked his intent throughout his time at the crease. “Afternoon Jonathan,” afternoon Thomas Burgess. “Long time reader, first time emailer. Currently keeping up to date with things from an extremely hot beach in Lefkada (Greece), or at least I will be up to date until my phone gets too hot to function.” I’d like to be on a Greek beach. Actually, I’d like to be in a Greek taverna sipping retsina and finally getting around to that Rob Smyth long-read about England under Glenn Hoddle. I fear you’re right, although Pope’s debut was incredibly assured despite falling for a middling score. “This game is being played like both teams have somewhere else to be on Monday and are determined to make up for time lost to the weather,” emails Brian Withington. “Can we expect to see Buttler promoted up the order to help “move things along”?”. Well, yes we can, but only because he’s scheduled to bat six anyway and England lost four wickets in the session. Time to catch up on some correspondence.Peter Salmon asked a question before the start of play about which country has had the most debut centurions in the same line-up. I presumed he knew the answer, but apparently not. “Not got the answer at my fingertips but three looks about right having found the following clusters – Doug Walters, Greg Chappell and Gary Cosier Dirk Wellham, Kepler Wessels and Wayne Phillips Lawrence Rowe, Allvin Kallicharran and Gordon Greenidge Alisatir Cook, Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott. Although if anyone can find a test with Cook, Prior, Trott, Andrew Strauss and Graham Thorpe then we’d have five...”This game refuses to slow down with India plugging away to snare four English wickets in the session. That makes it 14 dismissals in just 60 overs for the match. Three LBWs this morning, two failed reviews, and plenty more fun to look forward to this afternoon.24.4 over: England 89-4 (Bairstow 4) And with that, lunch will be taken.Nearing lunch here at Lord’s but England are happy to take any runs on offer. Bairstow adds to his total first with a two then a one before Root clips a couple through midwicket. And would you believe it, Shami nabs a wicket with a jaffa. Just short of a good length outside off stump the ball nips in sharply and skids lower than you might expect to pin Root bang in front. No reviews left, but it wouldn’t have mattered.24th over: England 84-3 (Root 17, Bairstow 1) This pair of right-handed Yorkshireman should know each other’s games inside out but they have run-out history and they almost add to it before Root turns heel and es to reclaim his ground. Another decent over from Hardik Pandya who is executing his third seamer role to perfection so far (6-0-15-1).“My tongue in cheek suggestion for getting the overs in is to force the players back for a sixth day to make up any that are considered short. This obviously doesn’t include stoppages for rain or bad light or whatever.” Harsh but fair Graeme Thorn, harsh but fair. 23rd over: England 82-3 (Root 16, Bairstow 0) Root chases and misses a wide one from Shami that has the cordon chirruping. It’s amazing what a wicket can do. England cruising a minute or two ago, now it’s game on again. Well, that is until Root rolls his wrists across a slanting Shami delivery, prompting a flurry of four signs from the Lord’s patrons. 22nd over: England 77-3 (Root 11, Bairstow 0) This game continues to rattle along at a fair clip. Pope looked very good for his 28. Composed at the crease, solid technique, ran well, looked to score, plenty to build on. The wicket was reward for some hard work from Pandya who has bowled a consistent line and length all morning and asked questions from that awkward angle wide of the crease. He poses a couple more to Bairstow before he’s had chance to settle but the Yorkshireman survives, just.Here’s what messrs Cook, Jennings and Pope can look forward to this afternoon. A promising innings ends sooner than hoped for Pope. Pandya has been ploughing a furrow from wide of the crease, angling the ball into the right-hander’s pads and eventually Pope missed one. It looked a good shout live but Pope gambled there was enough in the Ntini-like angle to miss leg or bounce over to call for a review. As with Jennings’ earlier, it was a wasted call. 21st over: England 75-2 (Root 11, Pope 26) It’s no surprise to see Kuldeep removed from the attack but in his place it’s the returning Shami, this time from the pavilion end, not Ashwin. Shami begins with a hint of width that Pope pounces on to smear a cover-driven four, but the wily bowler is having none of that from the debutant, beating him with perfect outswingers from his next two deliveries. 20th over: England 70-2 (Root 11, Pope 21) Pandya still running in hard and hitting a tidy line and length from wide of the crease at the nursery end. Four dots are followed by two singles as the game continues in this increasingly promising phase for England. Yes, yes, so much yes, Boris Starling. “Surely it’s high time that cricketers, like boxers and darts players, got their own intro songs played over the PA to accompany their walk to the wicket? If so, Ollie Pope could do worse than this one: an underrated Prince classic.”19th over: England 68-2 (Root 10, Pope 20) Kuldeep continues but this partnership is blossoming with both batsmen getting well forward or well back, putting bat to ball with increasing regularity. Ashwin can’t be far away now, surely. Tony Cowards, take a bow son. “To take Oman Jundi’s enquiry (17th over) one step further, I was wondering whether there are any oboe playing OBOers with an OBE?” 18th over: England 63-2 (Root 8, Pope 17) A couple of singles and a two keep the scoreboard ticking over with Pope looking every inch a Test batsman at the moment. Hugely impressive debut so far. Dizzy’s on board with my crusade. “Simple cure,” reckons Ian Hunter. “If a team does not meet the allocated overs per hour (with allowances for wickets etc ), penalty runs are added to the opposition score in real time - let’s say 10 runs per hour , could be additional 60 runs at the end of the day - I think that would get things moving on at the required speed very quickly.”17th over: England 59-2 (Root 7, Pope 14) Kuldeep still doesn’t seem to be doing exactly what he wants, but his variations are such when he gets one right he is hard to pick. He makes Root look a little silly with one that spins to off but the England skipper escapes.Oman Jundi has asked if any of you OBOers actually play the oboe? It reminds me of an old Vic and Bob sketch about doing voodoo that I can’t find a link for. 16th over: England 59-2 (Root 7, Pope 14) Hardik is flinging them down in the mid-80s mph and on a nice tight line and length, bringing all the obvious modes of dismissal into play. He looks to be using the crease smartly, stepping wider every so often to create an Ntini-like angle into the right-handers. From one of those he induces the drive from Pope but the ball holds its line and beats the outside edge to a chorus of “oooohhhs”. Unruffled, Pope steps inside the line of the next delivery and milks a couple on the legside. “Much has been made of Pope batting at 5 or below in 1st class cricket,” emails Robert Taylor, “but isn’t that just because he’s their keeper? CAUTION: MOCKERS INCOMING: he’s looked more comfortable than Root so far.” Indeed he has. He’s looked to the Apostolic manor born. 15th over: England 57-2 (Root 7, Pope 12) Kuldeep hasn’t settled into a groove yet and Pope capitalises, king a boundary through the off side. Oliver Deed agrees with me about over rates. “12 overs in an hour is an embarrassment. If cricketers want the Test match format to survive and flourish they must up the over rate. A large fine for each member of the team and a sizeable run penalty for a slow rate would sort the problem out very, very quickly.”14th over: England 52-2 (Root 7, Pope 7) Double change for India with Hardik Pandya replacing the impressive Shami (6-3-12-1) from the nursery end. Line and length stuff from the allrounder is respected by England with Pope dabbing one into the offside, Root squirting a couple in the same area.“Morning Sir,” morning Alisdair Gould. “Large audience for the Pope this morning in the Square?” Boom, and indeed tish. Keep them coming. 13th over: England 49-2 (Root 5, Pope 6) First bowling change of the day has Kuldeep Yadav replacing Sharma from the pavilion end. There’s some slow turn for the left-arm wrist spinner, who is coming over the wicket to the two right-handers, but there’s not much control. Along with six byes from two legside deliveries Pope sweeps for one and Root drives forcefully through the covers for four. If you’ll permit me a brief whinge, this 13th over was the first of the second hour of play. 12 overs an hour is pitiful. Something has to be done to speed up play. We’re supposed to have 98 overs today with just an extra 30 minutes allocated to fit in the extra eight. Teams can rattle through the game in white ball cricket, why do we stand for such sluggishness at Test level?12th over: England 38-2 (Root 1, Pope 5) A slight break in momentum as Root pulls away late but Shami releases anyway and obliterates middle stump, causing some DIY to get the timbers back up to scratch. Maiden over, Shami straight, Root increasingly secure.Here’s a TMS link for OBOers in parts of the world where there is no contractual impediment to listening live. 11th over: England 38-2 (Root 1, Pope 5) Ishant has two square legs to Pope, one slightly forward of square, clearly the plan being to angle the ball in to the debutant and induce the miscued flick. Pope undoes that plan immediately with a single through the off-side. It is a run that exposes Root to more trauma though, the skipper playing and missing immediately before Sharma lets him off the hook with some looseners outside off, the last of which is a duck-dodging single. 14 nervy balls for that one run. 10th over: England 36-2 (Root 0, Pope 4) Shami is bang on the money first ball over the wicket to Root, almost inducing the edge with a beauty. Root gets an awkward leading edge off the second before the third skews off another leading edge just in front of gully. Shami really into his work now, hitting almost 90mph and presenting a beautiful seam. Root defends the fourth then plays and misses at the fifth before leaving the last. It’s incredible how this morning has transformed in a matter of minutes. 9th over: England 36-2 (Root 0, Pope 4) In the blink of an eye England have gone from a pair of left-handers and cruising to a pair of right-handers and rebuilding. One of those new batsmen is the England captain, the other is debutant Ollie Pope, who whips his second ball in Test cricket Ponting-like off middle stump behind square for four. This game is rattling along. 12 wickets in 44 overs so far. “Will Oliver Pope come out to bat by means of an ornate chair?” asks Matthew Doherty. No, no Popemobile for young Ollie. Deary me, what is happening out there!? Cook carves Sharma’s first delivery to point for four and then tickles a tiniest edge through the keeper off the next. Good delivery from Sharma, the line and length forced Cook to play and the seam away from the left-hander coaxed the nick. Game on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26d5aeec0268096fbc1b32167c81e9e47fcd87d/0_0_5389_3234/master/5389.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f70b7bf00a3374d65bfa093320df142b","title":"us pga championship 2018 day three second third round live","story":"Shane Lowry has done nothing in the majors since leading the 2016 US Open after three rounds. But he seems of a mind to change that this week. He’s just stiffed his second at the par-four 7th from 100 yards to 18 inches! That just needs toe-punting into the hole. It’s his fifth birdie of a flawless round, and he’s -6. This is a serious challenge now!Rory, at -1, is hovering just a couple of shots above the cut line. Right now, everyone over par is going home. Evens are not certain of making it yet. His heart’s in his mouth as he goes for the flag at the par-three 13th, but looks to have found the deep bunker guarding front right. If he’s plugged in that, he’s in trouble, because there’s not much green to play with. This is what did for Rickie Fowler earlier. But his ball’s snagged on the bank, and he’s able to chip close to save his par. Phew. But holes are running out, and he’s currently nine off the lead. Nothing’s insurmountable yet, but he’s got to start making birdies soon, and he doesn’t look in a particularly upbeat mood. Frustration has taken over: right now, it looks like his major-championship drought is set to continue for another year. Pars for JT and Tiger too.It would have been too good to be true. Nevertheless, Tiger lags up brilliantly to four feet. The longest putt he’d sunk this season was 43 feet the longest putt made on Tour this year was a Jordan Spieth 90-footer. So I probably got a bit over-excited there. Still, what’s the point of sport if you don’t? Anyway, he’s surely saved his par ... but then misreads the short putt, lining up expecting some left-to-right break. He hits the putt true, and it stays out left. Bogey, and he’s back to -3. Pars for JT and Rory.Tiger finds the 12th green in regulation. Only problem is, his ball has just crept onto the front right, and the pin’s back left. He’s left with a putt measuring 101 feet and seven inches! Now here’s the thing: when Nick Price won the PGA here in 1992, he sunk a birdie putt at 12 on Saturday from 105 feet. Just sayin’. Imagine if he rakes this one into the cup! Bellerive will spin off into space.Maybe a Matsuyama birdie charge is on! He picks up his second stroke of the morning with birdie at 14, sending his second from 170 yards to six feet. He’s -5. Time for one of these ...Tiger’s going to make bounce-back birdie at the short par-four 11th. He lays up, then nearly spins his wedge into the cup from 88 yards. He’ll tap in to move to -4. JT attempts to drive the green, but ends up in the swale to the left of the putting surface. He clips his wedge close and cleans up for birdie as well. He’s -3. And finally Rory, who like Tiger lays up and wedges in. He leaves himself pin high, with a ten-footer across the green. He changes his mind on line at the last minute, the confidence visibly draining from his face as he adjusts his cap and consults his chart. Wrong decision: his birdie putt slides past the hole on the left. He’s -1. His putting has arguably cost him the Masters and the Open this year: think the momentum-buggering eagle miss at 2 on Sunday at Augusta, and the series of short ones that didn’t drop at Carnoustie. The rest of his game’s in good nick. This is becoming a big problem.Rickie drops his first shot since the opening hole of his round. He finds the sand front right of the par-three 13th, and with not much green to work with, can’t get close with his splash out. Two putts and he’s back where he started this morning at -7. Meanwhile Hideki Matsuyama, searching for that elusive maiden major, birdies 11 to move to -4. He’s a streaky putter, so if his flat stick is hot today, the extra bunch of holes will give him a chance to launch another challenge for this title. He came close last year, but never really turned up for the final round. It’d be fun to see him embark on one of his birdie tear-ups.Tiger takes a needless step backwards, missing a short par putt on 10 to slip to -3. He looks accordingly sick. The defending champ JT isn’t much happier after missing a birdie chance from 12 feet. He stays at -2. Par for Rory: he’s -1.Rickie keeps his momentum going with a street-fighting par on 12. Facing an up-and-down from a bunker 30 yards from the green, he sends his third to 12 feet and knocks in the missable par saver. He stays at -8 those can be as good as a birdie. There’s morning glory for Shane Lowry as well: the 2016 US Open runner-up birdies 3 to move to -5. Jason Day is heading the right way, too, after birdie at 9: he’s -5. But bogey for Billy Horschel at 2: the erstwhile FedEx Cup champ slips back to -4. An awful lot going on already! This is like a Moving Day bonus track.Pars for Tiger and Rory at 9 in the marquee group, but a bogey for JT. That means Tiger’s hit the turn in 31 strokes. He’s wearing the same gameface he had on yesterday, walking with the same determined strut. If he can keep this going, we could be in for quite a weekend. But he wasn’t the only player running hot last night: Rickie Fowler was on a roll. And he’s started as he finished last night, making birdie at 11 after sending a wedge to four feet from 100 yards. He’s -8, a couple off the lead.Eddie Pepperell was going along very nicely last night. Having started out at 10, he was -4 for his round having just birdied 3. But this morning starts with bogey at 4. He’s -1 for the championship overall. Maybe he should have had some pints for breakfast his final-day 67 at the Open last month, which earned him a top-ten place, was famously shot with a raging hangover. That’s Dr Golf’s assessment, anyway.Rory’s blood runs cold as he takes a 3-wood off the tee at 9, sends it into the rough to the right of the fairway, then has trouble finding it. Tiger comes over to help. A few furrowed brows. But eventually he locates the little dappled orb. He’s waiting for a ruling perhaps someone trod on it during the search. While he’s faffing around, Tiger and JT find the green in regulation, though neither are particularly close. Ah, it seems the ball was plugged, and the embedded rule is in play, so he gets a free drop. That’s quite a break. And he takes advantage by sending his second pin high. He’ll have a 20-foot look at birdie.The marquee group of McIlroy, Woods and Thomas were coming down the par-five 8th when the klaxon went. McIlroy had been on a frustrating run of pars, and has clearly come out this morning with a plan to attack a course that should be receptive after the big drink it had yesterday. He lashes his second into a greenside bunker, but screeches his third to a couple of feet. That’s his first birdie of the round, and at long last he’s in red numbers: -1. He’ll need a few more if he’s to get seriously involved. Especially as Tiger picks up where he left off: he makes his fourth birdie of the round to rise to -4. And the defending champion JT makes it a full house of birdies in this group: a long eagle putt drifts by, but he tidies up to move to -3.And we’re off again! When the weather hooter went yesterday evening, Rickie Fowler had just birdied 10 after stiffing an iron to five feet. So this is how the top of the leader board looks as we restart.Welcome to Moving Day! Although we’ll be waiting a while for the trademark manoeuvres of the third round ... because the second round is yet to be completed. The likes of Rickie, Tiger, JT and Rory were left hanging last night as a storm broke out over Bellerive, and play was suspended for the day. So here we all are.The players will be back out in place at 7am in St Louis, 1pm in the UK, ready to continue their second rounds when the klaxon sounds. Then the third round will be played in groups of three, with a split-tee start, beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of the second round. The PGA approximate that the third-round tee times will be between 11.15am and 1.15pm (5.15pm and 7.15pm UK time). But let’s not get hung up on details yet. One thing at a time. It promises to be a long one ... but a good one. Call Dr Golf for extra towels! It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1530ff3c67078b6c495bdf72b140baf850be3b57/0_92_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024eaa79085adcf042e51c85974b601d","title":"julie hesmondhalgh interview edinburgh fringe the greatest play in the history of the world","story":"Julie Hesmondhalgh, 48, was born in Accrington, Lancashire.

It’ll be romantic: in our 70s we can go and do it at festivals. So obediently, he kept disappearing over Christmas, and came back with this beautiful little gem of a play about love and loss and space and time.Reviewers have commented on what a lovely time you seem to have performing it. Are you?I’m terrified still! But you’ve got to fake it till you make it.Did you have any squabbles with your husband in the rehearsal room?No, he’s great. I did try my hand at rewriting swathes of it – and always ended up going back to what he’d written in the first place. I was just throwing my weight around really and, bless him, he let me.Is this your first time performing at the fringe?It is. I’ve seen 18 shows in the first week! I love it – it’s my happy place. You’ve got to make sure you don’t make yourself ill with running around, but it’s right up my street.Have you been given any advice for how to “survive” the month?It’s basically been just take your vitamins – which I have been doing, religiously – and have one day a week where you don’t see anything. I haven’t managed that yet…Do you have any tips for what to see?What Girls Are Made of, the Cora Bissett show. I found it one of the most incredibly moving and beautiful pieces that I’ve ever seen, let alone from this festival. It’s her story of losing her dad, and her brief flirtation with fame in the Britpop era.You’re a staunch Labour supporter. When did that start?Oh, always: I’m from a small northern industrial town and I lived through the Thatcher years. I’m a socialist, and it’s the engine that fires me, really – just hoping for a better, more equal society. These are such strange times we’re living in, you can see how quickly things can change for example, the #MeToo movement, which just shifted everything on its axis. Surely we’re at the tipping point now for austerity.Do you think people are reclaiming the term “socialist” after generations of it being a bit of a dirty word?Yeah, I do actually, in the same way that “feminist” has been reclaimed. I have teenage daughters and they give me such hope: their outlook on the world is so much more inclusive and accepting than even a generation ago. We’ve got a new generation who are proud to be socialist, and that’s really exciting.How do you feel Labour is performing?Everyone knows we’re in difficult times. But I’ve shared a platform with Jeremy Corbyn for many years and I know him to be a man of deeply held principles. The current problems in the party need to be sorted out, but if we carry on fighting within the left, the Tories are going to get in again. And it’s not just a matter of dinner party conversation – people are losing their lives. Disabled people are dying at an astonishing rate, the NHS is on its knees…Do you think it’s your duty as someone with a public profile to campaign politically?I think it’s my duty as a citizen it’s nothing to do with being a famous person. If you dare to go on a demonstration or raise your voice in solidarity with people that have less than you, people say: “Oh luvvies, what’s it got to do with you?” I’m not there as a luvvie – I’m there as a person who lives in this country, and wants to pay more tax! I’ve nothing to gain from it.You made history playing Hayley in Coronation Street at a time when trans narratives were very rare. Do you feel proud of it?I’m amazingly proud of it. It started a conversation, because soaps often do. Corrie put a love story at the heart of it – and that’s how you change the world. You’re hosting a charity sing-a-long screening of Mamma Mia in September. What’s your favourite Abba tune?Dancing Queen – obviously!

In one of the lawsuits, the plaintiff Kalman Isaacs said Musk’s tweets were false and misleading, and together with Tesla’s failure to correct them amounted to a “nuclear attack” designed to “completely decimate” short-sellers. The lawsuits filed by Isaacs and William Chamberlain said Musk’s and Tesla’s conduct artificially inflated Tesla’s stock price and violated federal securities laws.Short-sellers borrow shares they believe are overpriced, sell them, and then repurchase shares later at what they hope will be a lower price to make a profit. Such investors have long been an irritant for Musk, who has sometimes used Twitter to criticize them. The stock has since given back more than two-thirds of that gain, in part following reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had begun inquiring about Musk’s activity. Musk has not offered evidence that he has lined up the necessary funding to take Tesla private, and the complaints did not offer proof to the contrary. But Isaacs said Tesla’s and Musk’s conduct caused the volatility that cost short-sellers hundreds of millions of dollars from having to cover their short positions, and caused all Tesla securities purchasers to pay inflated prices. Tesla’s market value exceeds $60bn and its shares closed on Friday up $3.04 at $355.49. According to his complaint, Isaacs bought 3,000 Tesla shares on 8 August to cover his short position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0d10eb2f865ab83c49b901741e3233dd2275679/0_428_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a12bc8b212990fd1e3f3fe52c80f5ca6","title":"how ethical is the elephant sanctuary youre visiting","story":"On the eve of World Elephant Day experts advise how to avoid cruel elephant attractions and support genuine welfare centres“Many parks advertise themselves as sanctuaries but they are not,” says Maria Mossman, founder of non-profit group Action for Elephants UK. “Never go to a park that advertises shows, unnatural behaviour, tricks or painting – and please, never ride an elephant.”Mossman, who has been involved in elephant activism since 2013, and also organises global marches, says that real sanctuaries will limit contact with the elephants, with visitors observing them from a distance the majority of the time. She warns travellers to avoid anywhere offering riding or allowing bathing sessions with elephants: “In some places this means a lot of people every hour with the elephants in the water – it’s not natural for an elephant to be in the water all day with lots of people climbing all over them.”Looking on review sites and images online before visiting elephant camps is also advised. Avoid any companies calling themselves “sanctuaries” that are using bull-hooks or chains, or lacking basic provisions of water, food and shade. Vicki Brown, editor at Responsible Travel, says that the prevalence of riding perpetuates the industry. “It increases demand for captive elephants to be used as tourist attractions – which means more baby elephants must be captured from the wild, or sometimes bred for a life in captivity,” she says. “Captive elephants should be allowed to live as naturally as possible, so if they are forced to display unnatural behaviours – such as dancing, painting or playing football – this is being done for the tourists’ benefit, not the elephants’. Don’t visit these places.”The cruel process of intensively conditioning the elephants to obey keepers and allow people to ride them goes largely unseen by tourists. “In order to ensure they are safe around humans, the baby elephants must be broken in – a brutal and distressing process known as ‘crushing the spirit’,” says Brown. “They are kept in a tiny pen to prevent movement, with their legs tied tightly. They can be severely beaten with sharp objects, screamed at and starved of food and water, which can last for several days or weeks. The psychological impact then means that the fear of being beaten will ensure that the elephant ‘behaves’ around tourists.”Mossman believes that “the tour sector needs to play a much bigger role” in clamping down on animal tourism overall. Earlier this year, Tripadvisor announced further changes to its animal welfare policy, following the “no touching of wild animals” addition in 2016. The company has now also banned sales of tickets to “animal shows and performances where animals are forced to perform demeaning tricks or unnatural behaviours”. But it still lists these attractions on the site, and has been criticised for not going far enough. “We would question how educational touching captive wildlife can really be,” Brown says. “It also permits encounters in zoos where ‘physical interaction is initiated by the animals themselves’, claiming this is ‘a natural behaviour’. But in their natural habitats, wild animals almost never initiate contact with humans, so to describe this as natural is misleading.”So what should travellers do if they see abuse happening? “Do your bit by leaving your own review to warn other travellers. It really does work – many camps are now becoming ride-free as a result of pressure from tourists, the industry and the media,” Brown says. “Photos and videos are especially powerful tools, so be sure to capture evidence if you can. Share on review sites and social media. Tweet them directly.”She also suggests that if you book through a tour operator or agent, raise your concerns with them – many do not have representatives on the ground and only find out about bad practices through travellers alerting them to it. “This is how several of our campaigns have come about – so it really can have a positive impact,” she says. “And if you meet other travellers along the way, warn them. Word of mouth is a powerful tool on the road, particularly in hostels. Do spread the word about the good places you visit too they need all the support they can get.”Although many elephants spend their entire lives in captivity, an increasing number are being cared for by organisations that allow them to live in natural, big, open spaces with other elephants, the correct food and veterinary care. “Ethical tourism is the way forward for captive elephants,” says Mossman, who notes that in many areas, particularly in Thailand, there is no longer adequate land to release them into the wild.Brown also suggests that keeping ex-working or captive elephants in sanctuaries can be the best option. “The vast majority will never be released, as they have been habituated and cannot fend for themselves in the wild,” she says. “Volunteers are very much needed at the sanctuaries – it takes an awful lot of work to care for an elephant. Just preparing food can take hours a day!”With so many organisations now claiming to be sanctuaries, which ones do the experts say are OK to visit or volunteer at?

He continued to churn out one video after another on his website, app, and Twitter, where he has not been banned. But, while Infowars is still operating, experts say its reach has been greatly reduced. “This has potentially a massive effect on the reach of Infowars and the political power of Alex Jones,” said Daniel Kreiss, a professor at the school of media and journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “This significantly limits Infowars’ visibility in the public sphere.”Jones is urging his followers to come straight to his website – “the one platform that they CAN’T ban”, he tweeted – and plugging his app’s rise to the number one “trending” app on the Google Play store.And he’s leaning increasingly on alternate platforms that have sprung up in reaction to mainstream sites’ prohibitions on content they view as hateful or offensive.There’s Gab.ai, a Twitter-style site that brands itself “the free speech social network” and claims 500,000 users, and Real.Video, a YouTube alternative whose founder said it saw 350 new channels created in one day after the Infowars bans.Mike Adams, who founded Real.Video after his own channel was banned by YouTube, urged supporters to boycott mainstream platforms.“It’s going to get much worse if we don’t stop them,” he said in a video on his site. “The tech giants have now declared war on America...This has become the civil rights issue of our time.”Despite their growth, these alternative sites cater to a niche audience whose size pales in comparison to the platforms that banished Infowars.“It’s really hard to imagine there being an alternate social media network that comes anywhere close to having the same scale and scope as a Facebook,” Kreiss said. “It is the de facto public sphere in a lot of ways. It is the one thing that everyone is on. People from all walks of life, all demographics, all ideological persuasions,” he said. “There is simply no alternative to that.”Jones’ channel on YouTube, which had 2.4 million subscribers, was one of the most recommended on the site, according to an analysis by researchers Jonas Keiser and Adrian Rauchfleisch. Once the page was gone, Fox News became the most recommended channel in far right and conspiracy circles, they found.Jared Holt, a researcher with Right Wing Watch at People for the American Way who has pushed to get Jones’ pages removed, said the bans will make the casual internet user far less likely to come upon Infowars.“Infowars has existed for decades and has built its own distribution networks, so for the most dedicated Infowars fans this is merely an annoyance,” he said. “But the greater effect this has is that Alex Jones and Infowars cannot distribute these kinds of vitriolic conspiracy theories and smears as easily to the general American public.”In videos posted since the removals, Jones has alternated between bravado and desperation.“I am not backing down,” he said in one video, though he acknowledged feeling “spiritual-level desperation” and seemed to see Trump as his only hope to regain his larger platform.“Come out before the midterms and make censorship the big issue,” Jones said in an appeal to Trump.“It’s the right thing to do, Mr President. It’s the truth,” he said. So far, Trump has not ridden to the rescue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813ae2269770d066d884539bc475b2487030bb60/0_69_5555_3333/master/5555.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b13a4a9c6ab13e798522da75e004000","title":"knokke heist belgium rising sea levels environment tourism","story":"Proposed offshore island to protect a haunt of Sinatra and Dietrich would be its ruin, says long-time mayorIt is known affectionately as Belgium’s answer to St Tropez – a town once frequented by Frank Sinatra and Marlene Dietrich and which has inspired the pop art of Keith Haring and surrealism of René Magritte, who painted the walls of the town’s casino.But now the chic, if slightly faded, seaside resort of Knokke-Heist is, in the words of its mayor, Count Leopold Lippens, in a “fight for its life”. The Flemish government, in an attempt to limit the damage to the Belgian coast from rising sea levels, has announced plans for an artificial island of 40 hectares (99 acres) 1.2 kilometres from the sandy beach, to act as a bulwark against the waves. Belgium has, until now, been slow to respond to climate change and its coast has suffered severe damage during recent storms.Lippens, mayor since 1979, said the municipality’s tourism revenues of €700m a year would be halved should the plans be approved. “We have to beat this,” he said. The 77-year-old has hired specialist lawyers to fight his corner.The threat of rising waters is not unappreciated by the authorities in Knokke-Heist, a favourite hideout of the Belgian king, Philippe, and popular with artists since the Belgian painters James Ensor and Alfred Verwee captured its vistas on canvas in the early 19th century. The sea is expected to rise by 30cm by 2050 and 80cm by the end of the century. In 2016, Storm Dieter brought waves around two metres high crashing onto the front. About €17m was invested in a rebuilding programme, which included the replacement of 1.2m cubic metres of sand.Lippens says studies by the authorities in the Netherlands suggest better solutions. “It is the dredging companies who are pushing for the work to make the island because the Chinese have taken a lot of jobs away,” he said. “In Holland, where the land is much lower than in Belgium, they have studied all the systems, studied the islands, and it would be worse than just using more and more sand on the beaches. That is what they are doing and that is what we want.”Not everyone agrees. Cathy Coudyser, who sits for the Flemish nationalist party, the N-VA, in the Flemish parliament and on the city council, said Lippens, a member of the Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams party, was playing politics before an October election.She told the Belgian daily Het Nieuwsblad: “We have explained to Mayor Lippens the plan several times. Still, he continues to send wrong information to the world without blinking, including on the website of the municipality.“Doing nothing is not an option for Knokke,” she added. “The coast in Knokke is a weak zone, which is severely affected by a violent storm, probably with a lot of damage and heavy flooding.“Several other options have been studied, such as raising the sea dyke. But then the apartments would disappear behind a concrete wall. That seems to us a much worse solution.”The Flemish government has already released €8m for the island, which is part of its 2020-26 coastal management plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a578169cad46560454f74ce4ec3af57c37d12967/0_256_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2781d6cfc326504176f4de988194a5","title":"lombok earthquake leaves idyllic gili islands facing uncertain future","story":"Destruction forces visitors to flee beaches popular with ers and honeymoonersThe walls were swaying as Tori Taylor tried to feel her way across them in the dark after the 6.9-magnitude earthquake shook the island of Gili Trawangan, off Lombok in Indonesia, last Sunday.There had been another large tremor the week before, but this one felt larger.“It was unbelievable, crashing sounds, rumblings of the earth, falling tiles, smashing glass, spraying water, people screaming – absolutely terrifying,” the American, who runs a e resort, wrote in a diary she has kept of the disaster.On nearby Gili Meno, Andi Darmin huddled on the roof of his bungalow with his guests, including a couple and their eight-month-old baby. “Can you get a helicopter?” one of the European guests asked him. “I will pay whatever it costs.”Although they escaped the worst of the disaster, the Gilis – three idyllic islands popular with ers, party lovers and honeymooners – were plunged into emergency mode.On Gili Air, a western doctor and a few English nurses on holiday banded together to erect a makeshift medical tent in a field to treat the wounded, and instructed expats to collect painkillers and other supplies from tourists.On Gili Trawangan, the biggest of the three islands, where at least eight people died, doctors, e instructors and tourists set up a basic camp with oxygen and medical supplies and organised people into groups from minor injuries to the most severe. The bodies of the dead were laid out on the beach on sarongs before they were taken away to be cleaned for burial. Many people camped out overnight, too afraid to sleep indoors.Thousands of panicked tourists left the islands the following day, in some cases scrambling over each other to get a seat on one of the boats. Most headed straight for the international airport, where some slept on the floor as they waited for a flight out.The exodus leaves the mostly western-run tourist businesses facing an uncertain future. “When I look to the right there is no one, when I look to the left there is no one, just hundreds of bikes dumped at the port,” said Sander Buis, the Dutch owner of Oceans 5 Dive on Gili Air.“The weirdest part is that it is not just one part that is totally damaged. Some resorts are not in good shape. Others have no damage at all.”On Friday there was no running water on Gili Trawangan or Air, though there were plenty of supplies – in contrast to the more serious situation on the worse-hit main island of Lombok. Before electricity was reconnected, the owners on Air were clearing out all the island’s fridges and giving away the meat to local residents, who are sending it to their families in the north.Horses used to pull carts on the car-free island of Trawangan were being rounded up after running loose, and taken to the mainland. After reports of looting on Trawangan – there are no police on the Gili islands and it took days for the military to arrive – the security situation was improving.As aftershocks continue – there had been more than 450 by Friday – tourists are likely to stay clear of Lombok and the Gilis for now.Buis said he hoped things would start to feel more normal within six weeks. “Some resorts are not that damaged at all and some are,” he said. “So it is all about when the tourists are ready to come back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb50cedd62232b7795ab05b0f670a4de95356a8/188_250_613_367/master/613.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232df959ac5f361ecf98ab5a57ad332e","title":"seatac airport seattle plane takes off without permission","story":"F-15 fighter planes give chase after twin-propellor Q400 barges on to runway at Seattle-Tacoma airport and takes offA plane has been stolen from Seattle-Tacoma international airport by an airline employee and crashed, authorities have confirmed after F-15 fighter jets were scrambled and flights grounded in a major security incident. Military pilots contacted the rogue aircraft and it crashed soon afterwards, said local media, citing sources at the US air force Joint Base Lewis–McChord (JBLM) in Washington state. The plane came down on Ketron Island in the Puget Sound waterway about 25 miles south-west of the airport. Aerial television footage showed a fire in amongst trees.A law enforcement spokesperson said the incident was a suicide. The pilot was described as a 29-year-old ground service agent. The person had crashed by “doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills”, the Pierce County sheriff’s department said on Twitter.An Alaska Airlines spokesperson said the plane had been positioned in a maintenance area of the airport when it was taken. It had not been scheduled for passenger flight. The emergency shut down the airport, known as Sea-Tac, and the surrounding skies. The plane involved was a Horizon Air Q400 with no passengers on board, tweeted Alaskan Airlines. Videos posted online showed an aircraft matching the description being followed by what appeared to be a fighter jet.Recordings of an air traffic control conversation with the 29-year-old pilot supported the suicide claim. “This is not a terrorist incident,” said the Pierce county sheriff’s office, calling it a “suicide, single male”.Paul Pastor, the county sheriff, said there was no indication the person flying the plane had intended any harm to others. “Our information now is there was only one person on the plane. I understand the person may have been doing some air stunts or whatever. Some aircraft were scrambled from the air force base. There was no indication this person flying the plane was trying to damage anything.”Pastor said the man “did something foolish and may well have paid with his life”.The man could be heard on audio recordings telling air traffic controllers that he is “just a broken guy.”Flights were grounded with some passengers tweeting that their plane stopped abruptly on the runway. The Q400 is a twin-engined propeller plane made by Bombardier and sometimes referred to as a Dash-8. Horizon Air is a ision of Alaskan that flies short routes in the western US.Air traffic controllers and pilots could be heard discussing the “ground stop” and dealing with a backlog of aircraft in the aftermath of the drama.The Horizon Air chief operating officer, Constance von Muehlen, confirmed the plane was taken by a Horizon Air employee. “Our hearts are with the family of the inidual aboard, as well as all our Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees,” von Muehlen said by video.Airline employees told KIRO7 News the plane had been parked at a cargo terminal when it was taken. According to the Seattle CBS affiliate, the pilot then entered the line of outbound planes and took off around 8pm local time.Air National Guard F-15 fighter jets based in Portland, Oregon, rushed to the area within minutes of takeoff. Arriving ahead of sonic booms, they tailed the airliner for 45 minutes as it circled over suburban areas south of Seattle. The chase passed over a the Chambers Bay golf course, which hosted the US Open in 2015, before the pilot began turning barrel rolls over the Puget Sound.“It was low enough we could make out the Alaska face … so it was really low,” witness Ken Schmidtke told KIRO.The plane crashed in a wooded area of Ketron Island, a speck in Puget Sound believed to be home to 12 people. Firefighters and police boarded a ferry to extinguish the blaze and begin an investigation.The Washington state governor, Jay Inslee, praised the fighter pilots: “Those pilots are trained for moments like tonight and showed they are ready and capable,” the governor said on Twitter.While a criminal investigation is expected, the National Transportation Safety Board will conduct the most detailed review of the incident. Security concerns raised by the crash will be addressed as well.Flights through Sea-Tac airport had hour-long delays running well into the night. Flights erted to other airports in the region arrived later that evening. Summer weekends are particularly busy at the Seattle area’s only major airport as Alaska-bound tourists pour into the region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2959b6f99fd73b323c4b4d35f309b6444de8e61f/0_74_4913_2948/master/4913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218f0ed498cdc4e1671ea6db5852ab63","title":"shanghai residents sleep street heat in pictures","story":"Shanghai’s normally bustling Nanjing East Road has turned into an open-air bedroom on recent nights as local residents try to beat the heat of their cramped homes by sleeping outside on benches or directly on the pavement.

They strike up a rousing version of Courting in the Kitchen and suddenly everyone is swaying and tapping their feet.The Mexicans have been given bouquets of flowers along with Longines watches and the trophy. They remount and wait as the formalities are completed and Winston Churchtown (where was his top hat? Perhaps the Mexicans were dancing on it) completed his tour around the teams, patting their noses. The horses’ noses, that is.Rider Enrique Gonzalez waves his bouquet in the air. His horse Chacna takes fright and throws him off. He lands on the ground with an unmerciful thump, still holding the reins and still holding his bouquet. A small towel is quickly placed over the horse’s eyes to calm him down. Enrique, meanwhile, bounds to his feet and does an exaggerated bow to the cheering crowd.Shane Ross doesn’t notice any of this because he is doing a television interview further down the arena, beside the Children of Lir-themed jump. It is tradition for male guests invited to the president’s box on Nations Cup day – when the RDS is heaving with diplomatic types – to wear morning suits. Michael D prefers not to wear the top hat and tails. Yet again this year, he sticks to the tweed on what might, or might not be, his last trip to the RDS as President.Having presented the Aga Khan trophy to the jubilant men from Mexico (the country’s first time to win it), Michael D returns, via red-carpeted steps, to join his wife Sabina in the president’s box.The annual Aga Khan competition is quite a formal affair. Those of us thinking of the forthcoming election wondered if he might take the opportunity to press some voter flesh among the horseflesh during his visit. He didn’t. Upon arrival, he was quickly escorted inside the stand.“Uachtaráin, will you be doing any walkabouts today?”“I’m not sure yet,” he replied, sounding somewhat disappointed. “I’ll have to be told.” And with that, a woman from the RDS materialised and steered him firmly away from the notebooks with a hissed “We’re on live television.” She came back to say the President would be performing official duties all afternoon and wouldn’t be doing any walkabouts.Is this good or bad for Michael D, still serving as first citizen and bound by the strictures of office, but yet soon to be a candidate in what could be a bruising campaign?He is existing in a sort of presidential limbo, as questions necessarily arise about his time in office and his plans for future office but with no way for him to address them – at least until the race begins in earnest late in September. And even then it’ll be interesting to see how he deals with them.But for now, he is the President, doing what he has to do, even if journalists will be turning up in increasing numbers at his public events. And they won’t be waving notebooks in his direction to ask him for details about the lovely occasions he is attending.Still, he seemed to enjoy Friday’s spectacle, which was a sellout. Away from the packed arena and the emotional Mexicans (their utter delight at winning melted the hearts of even the most partisan home supporters), there were big crowds for the various showing classes in the rings outside and more again attending the art exhibitions and trade shows.You could have your tarot cards read for €50 and a consultation with a clairvoyant (“as seen on TV and newspapers”) for €50 or go all out and do both for the reduced rate of €80. What about some nice pick n’ mix to chew on while going about your business?It was €7 a bucket, but the treats were for horses.Representatives from Kara Creek Rank resort in Wyoming were at the show for the first time offering holidays with “an authentic cowboy experience”. Owner Monte Snook along with Brock Holbrook from Montana were manning the stand in their 10-gallon hats.“Are you a real cowboy?” we asked Brock.It’s a pity the Dáil is up for the holidays. We could have directed them to Kildare Street to find some kindred spirits.You can buy all sorts. We nearly came away with a dressing gown for the dog.There are lots of Americans about perusing the horses and hacking jackets. One of them is Evie Jobs, daughter of the late Steve Jobs, founder of Apple. She is a showjumper, but wasn’t competing in Dublin. Instead, she was supporting her boyfriend Eugenio Garza Perez, who was on the winning Mexican team.You could buy a bottle of Cristal in the champagne tent for €365. The prosecco was flying out.A young lad passed us in the Trade Hall. “These buckets are class, mam,” he said loudly to his mother. That’s the sort of thing you hear at the Horse Show.Jack Murphy (13) from Swinford was with his mother Mary and cousin Emma (13). They are from Castlegate stud and are showing two three year olds this week and two mares in foal.Jack had two large blue buckets. “They’re great because they are big and awful hard. Tough.” He was going to use them “for feeding big mares”.Speaking of which, there was any manner of grub for those of us in the big mare category. Even that ubiquitous Chinese takeaway delicacy known as The Spice Bag is available.But back to the Mexicans, who were deliriously and tearfully happy at the post-competition press conference. One of the team, Federico Fernandez survived a plane crash in 1987 in which 37 people died.“After what happened to me, I feel an obligation to be happy and today is one of the happiest days of my life,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3593511.1533991896!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nasa mission to the sun halted two minutes before blast off","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnited Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket with the Parker Solar Probe at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

small screens of smartphones more easilySince the Greeks switched from etching words in stone with a chisel to writing with ink on parchment or papyrus, the Western world has read from left to right.But the BBC has launched a new project which could completely change the way we process words.The corporation is testing a new kind of speed-reading technology in which news bulletins on smartphones or watches would be flashed up one word at a time, rather than being shown in full sentences.As part of the new technique, the reader\u0027s eye is drawn to the \u0027optimal recognition point\u0027 in the word, which is highlighted red.  That helps the brain identify the word more quickly than with traditional horizontal scanning so that words can be scrolled through more quickly. The optimum recognition point in the word is highlighted red to avoid having to scan horizontally to find the meaning While the average person reads at a rate of around 200 words per minute, the BBC are testing speeds of 300 to 800 words per minute.Speaking about the new project, Cyrus Saihan, the BBC’s Head of Digital Partnerships, said: “UK adults now spend more time online and consuming media each day than they do sleeping. We wanted to see what new technologies could be applied to make this overload of information easier for our audiences to manage.“The technology that we have used in our experiment works on the theory that, by showing you only one word at a time, your eyes can stay in a fixed position and so don’t have to be constantly moving whilst you read.“As a result, the rate at which you can read can be dramatically increased.”The technology could help people read smartphones more easily The corporation are working alongside the technology company Spritz, which invented the technique.Mr Saihan said it took a few minutes to adjust to the new process and after that it becomes ‘relatively easy’ to read full sentences. He claims it will with the problem of reading on smaller and smaller screens and make it easier to catch up on the headlines on a packed bus or train.The BBC said at the moment the project is just an experiment to see what is possible, but said such technology may become crucial in a world of augmented and mixed reality devices.Mr Saihan added: “We might need to completely adapt the way that we read – reading large blocks of text in mid-air might not be possible.“Perhaps speed reading text floating in the air, one word at a time, might become something that the children of the future consider to be the norm.”The BBC has teamed up with SpritzHowever experts have warned that the brain may not be able to keep up with such fast scrolling which could lead to eye problems, tiredness and failure to understand the sentence.Dr Cyriel Diels, a cognitive psychologist and human factors researcher at Coventry University said “A big difference with normal self-paced reading is that this system-paced reading requires continuous focus and attention on the display to be able to understand any text.“This will require more effort and may easier lead to fatigue and eye strain. As it is system paced you can easily miss out words and hence no longer understand the content.“People’s ability to follow the text will be different for different people, some may be able to follow it at high speeds whereas others won’t.“Having said that, I think it’s a great idea and impressive how well it works. It may be very suitable under certain circumstances. I don’t think it can totally replace traditional reading.”Epilepsy Action also said that they would want the technology to pass tests to make sure it was safe for people with epilepsy before it was rolled out“While this is potentially very exciting technology, it would need to be rigorously tested to ensure that this is safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy,” said a spokesman.“Any video containing flashing or flickering lights, or patterns should be tested to ensure that they will not trigger seizures.”Comment: Ant McPartlin\u0026#39s break from TV is needed not only for his own well-being but to help ITV build for the futureFishing competition lands itself in hot water amid cheating and bullying claimsA good songwriter, these days, is hard to find, says Feargal Sharkey\u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes on islandBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylMother \u0026#39held in Dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight\u0026#39Comment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelNew type of malaria net reduces cases in children under five, study finds Father shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/10/TELEMMGLPICT000171306911_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdODRziddS8JXpVz-XfUVR2LvJF5WfpqnBZShRL_tOZw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"new type malaria net reduces cases children five study finds","story":"Malaria killed 445,000 people in 2016A groundbreaking new type of bed net could prevent millions of cases of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, a study has found.Researchers trialled nets treated with a combination of chemicals – instead of the one variety usually used – among 2,000 children in 91 villages in Burkino Faso over two years.The study found that there was a 12 per cent fall in malaria cases among children sleeping under the new net, compared with those using conventional ones.“For a first test, the results are really exciting,” said Professor Steve Lindsay, a vector-borne disease specialist at Durham University and one of the authors of the study.  .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}If we take our foot off the gas, malaria will come back to haunt us againProfessor Steve LindsayTypically, mosquito nets are treated with an insecticide type called pyrethroid capable of killing and repelling mosquitoes, which is embedded in the net’s fibres during the manufacturing process.In recent years however, resistance to pyrethroids among female Anopheles mosquitoes – the type that seek out blood – has become a growing problem in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.In addition to pyrethroid, the new combination nets contain pyriproxyfen, an insect-like hormone which shortens the lives of mosquitoes and interferes with their ability to reproduce. It is thought the combination of the two ingredients kills more mosquitoes and reduces the number of infective bites. The study was the first clinical trial in the world to compare use of bed nets containing two active ingredients with the traditional net.As with therapies against diseases such as a tuberculosis, which use a combination of drugs in patients to help tackle antibiotic resistance, researchers say it is less likely for mosquitoes to become resistant to both chemicals in the combination bed nets.Malaria remains one of the world’s leading infectious killers. In 2016, the disease infected 216 million people across 91 countries, up five million from the previous year and killed 445,000 people, mostly children under the age of five.Some 80 per cent of malaria transmission occurs in Africa. Since 2000, there has been huge investment in malaria control on the continent which has halved the amount of malaria thanks mostly to distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and spraying of homes with mosquito-killing products.However, in the last three years progress against the disease has slowed – with numbers of infected people now increasing in some areas. Resistance to insecticides is thought to be one of the key causes  behind the stalling progress.“We are now entering a crucial point in the future history of malaria control globally and we need to have some good products,” said Prof Lindsay. “It’s an important contribution to the future of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.”Although a mosquito net alone is able to protect against malaria transmission for iniduals, treated nets are crucial in the broader fight against the disease, as insecticides when effective help reduce the overall population of mosquitoes in a community – leading to much more significant declines in rates of malaria.“The critical thing with malaria control is to reduce the average life of a mosquito,” said Prof Lindsay.As well as reducing the rate of malaria, the researchers found that the new nets reduced anaemia rates among children sleeping under them by 52 per cent. Malaria anaemia which results from infection of red blood cells by malaria parasites is a major cause of mortality in children under two years old.The trial which was conducted by a team of scientists from the UK, Burkino Faso and Switzerland was limited to 40 rural areas in Burkino Faso. Going forward, the researchers say that the next step will be to expand the study to further countries in sub-Saharan Africa.Prof Lindsay is hopeful that following further successful trials the  World Health Organization will approve the new nets.Malaria still kills a child every two minutes so we need to keep working to find the best ways to stop this from happening. It is clear that conventional methods used for controlling malaria mosquitoes need to be improved and new additional tools developed, he said.“If we take our foot off the gas, malaria will come back to haunt us again,” he added.War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Bed nets are crucial in the fight against malaria and have come a long way since the first ones dipped in insecticide were used in Africa in the 1980s. Unlike modern long-lasting insecticidal nets, the insecticide in early nets was not able to withstand washing and had to be re-treated every six months – a logistical challenge in many rural areas.Dr James Tibenderana,  technical director at the Malaria Consortium who was not involved in the research said that resistance was a significant concern.“It’s quite worrying for us to find some of the insecticides are not as effective as they have been in the past,” he said.He said that pyrethroids are rare in that they can get into the yarn of the net effectively at a concentration that is both effective and safe  while being well-priced. “We will probably not get that ideal again so we will be dealing with new dynamics.” “We needed new nets four or five years ago so we are catching up. Whatever net we get now it’s going to take time to get it out there,” said Dr Tibenderana.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security   Comment: Ant McPartlin\u0026#39s break from TV is needed not only for his own well-being but to help ITV build for the futureFishing competition lands itself in hot water amid cheating and bullying claimsA good songwriter, these days, is hard to find, says Feargal Sharkey\u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes on islandBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylMother \u0026#39held in Dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight\u0026#39Comment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelFather shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair screenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/11/TELEMMGLPICT000171425484_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdO0Jyi0jPPD6Zx1hiwTPhlc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bravissimo lingerie brand criticised telling customer bigger","story":"The high street lingerie chain was set up in 1995 for women with larger bust sizes.A lingerie company that caters for women with larger busts has been heavily criticised after telling a customer that it does not use plus size models in its promotional material because they are not “confident” enough.Bravissimo posted the comment on their Facebook page after a customer, who described herself as “a chubby size 16”, left one of their shop’s feeling “like an alien” because of the thin models featured on the posters.  Bravissimo was set up in 1995 by British entrepreneur Sarah Tremellen for women with larger chests sizes after she found it difficult to find bigger bra sizes on the British high street.The customer wrote that she found it “utterly bizarre” that the brand builds itself around large busted women, yet uses so few plus size models.Bravissimo replied: “We are really sorry to hear of your disappointment in the choice of models we use.“We would love to use a wider range of models but this can be a real challenge due to the difficulties in finding models with bigger boobs that are comfortable and confident in front of the camera especially when wearing underwear.”The brand quickly apologised for the comment, which sparked upset on social mediaThe comment sparked anger among many of Bravissimo’s customers and social media followers, with one saying it was an “incredibly disappointing response” from a brand she had used for many years.Chloé Jeüdi wrote: “Are you for real?

She is said to have been refused the chance to phone her partner and was then held in a cell.Ellie takes her partner Gary\u0027s surname but they are not legally married, Detained by Dubai said.Dubai, with its smart hotels, first-class shopping and sunshine, is a popular destination with Britons despite strict laws on personal moralityIn a statement from the group, Ms Holman claims the guards tried to rip out her hair extensions and described the prison as hot and foul smelling. She said the pair were made to sleep on a filthy mattress and she was told to clean toilets and floors.She said: My little girl had to go to the toilet on the cell floor. I have never heard her cry in the same way as she did in that cell.The food (we were given) smelled like rotting garbage and neither Bibi or I could face trying it. I stayed awake for the whole three days.By now, Gary knew something was wrong and had flown to Dubai to look for me. Friends had found out I was in jail and tried to visit. Nobody was allowed to see us. We were not even told.Unusual laws that tourists should be wary ofShe was released on bail and told her passport has been confiscated until the case is concluded. She said she has lost more than £30,000 in legal fees and missed work.Ms Holman is now spending time with her other children Suri, nine, and Noah, eight, who have flown out to Dubai to see her while Gary returns home with Bibi.Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said: The UAE maintains a deliberately misleading facade that alcohol consumption is perfectly legal for visitors.Tourists cannot be blamed for believing that the Emirates are tolerant of Western drinking habits, but this is far from reality.It is wholly illegal for any tourist to have any level of alcohol in their blood, even if consumed in flight and provided by Dubai\u0027s own airline. It is illegal to consume alcohol at a bar, a hotel and a restaurant and if breathalysed, that person will be jailed.10 surprising things you probably didn\u0026#039t know about DubaiMs Stirling called on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Government generally to do more to protect British nationals, and claimed airlines were complicit and needed to be held accountable.Consular staff spoke to Mr Holman about the incident, advised him on procedures in Dubai and also spoke to UAE authorities to confirm Ms Holman and her daughter were being released, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said.A Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman said the case had not been registered with them because they had not been contacted by Ms Holman.Emirates airline has been contacted for comment.Comment: Ant McPartlin\u0026#39s break from TV is needed not only for his own well-being but to help ITV build for the futureFishing competition lands itself in hot water amid cheating and bullying claimsA good songwriter, these days, is hard to find, says Feargal Sharkey\u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes on islandBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylComment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelNew type of malaria net reduces cases in children under five, study finds Father shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair screenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11 august 2018","story":"A seal pup rescued from  Abereiddy beach in Pembrokeshire is the first to be found abandoned the summer and the warm weather is being blamed.

Flames lit up the night as they spread from the burning wreckage to nearby trees. Officials said there were no victims on the ground.The stolen plane was a twin engine turboprop Q400 airplane belonging to its sister carrier Horizon Air, Alaska Airlines said on Twitter. It normally carries 76 passengers.This is not a terrorist incident, Ed Troyer with the Pierce County Sheriff\u0027s office wrote on Twitter.A Horizon Air Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, reported to be hijacked, flies over Fircrest, Washington, the U.S., before crashing in the South Puget Sound, August 10, 2018 in this still image taken from a video obtained from social mediaThe plane thief is confirmed a suicidal male, Troyer wrote. We know who he is.The suspect was identified as a 29-year-old airline mechanic and local resident who acted alone, Troyer added, confirming that there were no passengers on the plane when it crashed.The sheriff\u0027s office also said that the F-15s arrived minutes after the plane was stolen and kept the aircraft out of harms way and people on ground safe.Horizon Air chief operating officer Constance von Muehlen issued a video statement describing the incident.We believe it (the plane) was taken by a single Horizon Air employee and no other passengers or crew were on board, she said. Our hearts are with the family of the inidual aboard as well as all of our Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees.The plane was stolen at around 8pm (3am GMT Saturday) and crashed 90 minutes later, officials said.John Waldron, who took dramatic video of the stolen plane flying in a loop, told CNN that he was out for an evening stroll when he saw the two fighter jets following the turboprop airplane.His first thought was that they were practicing for an air show. So, I started to capture video, just because I thought it was kind of bizarre, he told CNN.Waldron said it seemed that the jets were chasing down the airplane. I thought this is really odd. Kept the video rolling.Then the passenger plane pilot did a complete loop ... I couldn\u0027t believe he recovered.He estimated that the plane at its lowest point was no more than 100 feet (30.5 meters) above the water.Then the pilot pulled - pretty much straight up. And kind of at an angle. And almost stalled the aircraft. Somehow he got it leveled back off. And then made his way down toward the island.Waldron said that he was prepared to run and take cover. He briefly turned away, then turned back and saw the explosion as the plane crashed.The pilot, identified as Rich, comes across as excitable, confused, and even apologetic in a conversation with the control tower.Congratulations, you did it, the control tower tells Rich, according to audio that aired on CNN. Let\u0027s turn around the air and land it and not hurt anybody on the ground.I don\u0027t know, man, the pilot answers. I don\u0027t want to. I was kind of hoping that was going to be it, you know.Rich explains that he had put some fuel in the plane to go check out the Olympics, but then worried that he was low on gasoline.The control tower gently urges him to land at a nearby military base. I wouldn\u0027t want to do that. They probably have anti-aircraft, he responds.This is probably jail time for life, huh? he later asks, according to a recording provided by the Seattle Times.Rich said: I\u0027ve got a lot of people that care about me. It\u0027s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now.Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor described the incident at a press conference as a joyride gone terribly wrong.Fishing competition lands itself in hot water amid cheating and bullying claimsA good songwriter, these days, is hard to find, says Feargal SharkeyBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylMother \u0026#39held in Dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight\u0026#39Comment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelNew type of malaria net reduces cases in children under five, study finds Father shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair screenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama Trump\u0026#39s new tariffs send Turkey\u0026#39s currency crashing, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/01/11/writer-desk.jpg","title":"author how to write advice twitter rule stephen king hemingway","story":"Created with Sketch.We all know there’s more than one way to skin a cat, so why should advice on how to write be so prescriptive? Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book. But first, maybe go read one.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/15/shreyas-royal.jpg","title":"chess boy uk stay home office shreyas royal visa battersea","story":"Created with Sketch.Indian-born boy described as one of \u0027outstanding chess talents of his generation\u0027 had faced deportation when father\u0027s visa expiresClick to followThe Independent OnlineShreyas Royal is ranked fourth for his age category in the worldThe\u0026nbspfamily of a\u0026nbspnine-year-old chess prodigy described as the greatest talent in a generation\u0026nbsphave their\u0026nbspwon their fight to stay in Britain.Indian-born Shreyas Royal came to the UK at the age of three but\u0026nbspfaced having to leave the country when his father’s work visa expires\u0026nbspnext month.The boy’s parents, MPs, and the English Chess Federation (ECF) had\u0026nbspappealed to home secretary Sajid Javid to let the family stay.On Friday, his father, IT manager Jitendra Singh, said the Home Office\u0026nbsphad told him he could apply to extend his visa.We have been waiting for a very long time, it\u0027s such a relief for us, he added. We are very much happy that my son can continue.He said Shreyas became very happy and jumped on the sofa and started dancing when he heard the news.Yesterday we were packing to leave, we thought we had to go, added Mr Singh, whose family live in Woolwich, south-east London.Battersea Chess Club, where Shreyas plays, welcomed the decision and the young player had “a big future ahead of him on the world stage, hopefully representing England.”“In 10 years’ time we hope he’ll be a household name as England’s first world champion,” the club added in a statement.Dominic Lawson, the ECF president, said: “We’re delighted that our efforts to persuade the government to recognise Shreyas Royal’s exceptional talents have borne fruit.”Shreyas, nicknamed\u0026nbspShrez, began playing chess with his father at the age of five and within two years had won a host of tournaments.Last year he became the youngest “candidate master” in the world and is currently ranked fourth in the world for his age group.Chris Ward, a chess grandmaster and former British champion, has described Shreyas as “the best prospect the country has ever seen”.Shreyas’s parents initially fought the threat of deportation on the grounds that their son was a national asset but their appeal was rejected.Their case was picked up MPs including Labour’s Rachel Reeves, a former junior chess champion, who wrote to Home Office last week asking for a review.UK news in picturesEngland cricketer Ben Stokes and his wife Clare, arrives back at Bristol Crown Court where he is on trial accused of affray, following a lunch break Stokes, 27, is accused of knocking out two friends, Ryan Hale, 27, and Ryan Ali, 28, during an alleged dispute near a nightclub in the Clifton Triangle area of Bristol on September 25 last year.

This is politically significant.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“There is clearly the potential for a broadly based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote\u0026nbspshould the Brussels talks go badly. Support for a new referendum would go well beyond the ranks of those who want to stop Brexit.”The pollsters asked “should the final decision be made by MPs voting in parliament or the public voting in a new referendum”, if the UK had to choose whether to remain in the EU or leave with no deal.It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this messHalf, 50 per cent, said the decision should be given to the public voting in a new referendum. Just 25 per cent said parliament should decide and 25 per cent said they did not know.Asked whether people agreed with the statement that “the negotiations are going badly at the moment”, a huge 74 per cent agreed to some extent, with just nine per cent disagreeing and 17 per cent saying they did not know.An even larger 83 per cent agreed with the statement that the “process of leaving the EU so far has been a mess”, with just six per cent disagreeing and ten per cent saying they did not know.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Whether people voted leave or remain two years ago, nobody voted for this chaotic Brexit that will damage our living standards and public services, and which is being thrust on the country by politicians in Westminster.“It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice, and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this mess.”Some 68 per cent agreed that “problems in the negotiations with the EU make it likely that Britain will get a bad deal”, with 13 per cent disagreeing and 19 per cent saying they did not know.In an ominous sign for the prime minister, 64 per cent agreed with the statement “if we get a bad deal, it will mainly be the UK government’s fault”, with 23 per cent disagreeing and 14 per cent saying they did not know.In the case that negotiations are completed, 45 per cent backed a new referendum on the deal, while 34 per cent opposed it\u0026nbspand 22 per cent said they did not know.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

That\u0027s one of the great pull factors.Leaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.We need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.The British Government has yet to publish its plans for a new post-Brexit migration system nearly two years after the EU referendum.Brexit news: IDS called on the Government to  (Image: )The lack of planning spurred the Home Affairs Committee to condemn the lack of a policy direction as \u0026ldquoregrettable and a \u0026ldquomissed opportunity.The report noted: \u0026ldquoContinued delays to the publication of the White Paper on Immigration and the Immigration Bill has meant there is little indication of what immigration policy will be.\u0026ldquoDespite the fact that the issue was subject to heated and isive debate during the referendum campaigns in 2016 the Government has not attempted to build consensus on immigration reform or consult the public over future migration policy in the two years since.The Committee has warned that migration policy \u0026ldquonow risks being caught up in a rushed and highly politicised debate in the run-up to the vote on the withdrawal agreement.The Chamber of British Commerce (CBI) has instead urged the Government to scrap blunt targets for immigration after Brexit, calling for a new freedom of movement system to be adopted.CBI deputy chief Josh Hardie said: This is no longer a theoretical debate, it\u0027s about the future of our nations.\u0026nbspFalse choices and sloganeering must be avoided at all costs. Openness and control must not be presented as opposites.\u0026nbspPublic attitudes towards migration and the impact it has on communities are far more nuanced.He added: Scrapping blunt targets, ensuring all who come to the UK contribute and using the immigration idend to support public services will add to public confidence.

They served alongside professional troops including Paratroopers, Guardsmen and Royal Marines.Much of the cat and mouse pursuit of terrorists centred on the Troodos Mountains which were perfect for guerrilla warfare.But the main street of Nicosia became known as \u0026ldquoMurder Mile because of assassinations.EOKA were led by George Grivas, a Cypriot-born retired Right-wing Greek officer, and inspired by Archbishop Makarios, the head of the Greek Orthodox Church on the island, who wanted it handed over to Athens and Cyprus was granted independence in 1960.But in 1974 the island became ided when Turkey invaded in response to a new attempt to unite it with Greece. Keith Lloyd, who served with the Welsh Guards and lives in Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus, said: \u0026ldquoEOKA\u0026rsquos favourite method of murder was to shoot British personnel in the back while they were shopping.But the counter insurgency campaign led to suspects being rounded up and interrogated.And the British Government is now fighting compensation claims in the courts over allegations that Greek Cypriot prisoners were tortured during interrogation.

Thorpe Park power cut: Hundreds TRAPPED on rides in sweltering 35C                 Chessington World of Adventures CLOSED due to burst water pipeThis year Black-gang Chine, named after the coastal ravine where it is located on the island\u0026rsquos wild southern shore, will celebrate its 175th birthday.\u0026nbspIn the process it has become the blueprint for all the UK\u0026rsquos theme parks. In some cases, quite literally.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBlackgang opened before teabags had been invented and we quite often see ideas of ours popping up in other theme parks, says owner Alec Dabell, who is named after his great-great-grandfather.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOne chap was saying how it is hard in our business to generate new ideas.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBut I\u0026rsquove got 25 years-worth of ideas already and I\u0026rsquom growing exponentially. What I really need to invent is a machine to make more time.\u0026nbspOne of his most recent ideas is a pond with a footpath through the middle enabling you to get a frog\u0026rsquos-eye view of the lily pads.\u0026nbspThere are also singing English dodos, a hall of mirrors, original rides, and the country\u0026rsquos biggest animatronic T-Rex.\u0026nbspBlackgang also has another illustrious claim to fame as the oldest continuously open amusement park in the world.\u0026nbspBlackgang Chine visitors in 1922 (Image: Blackgang Chine)\u0026ldquoDuring the war years the two slightly older ones, in occupied Denmark and Austria, closed but we remained open, he declares.\u0026ldquoOf course we did! We were British and we didn\u0026rsquot shut just because of a bit of adversity. As my grandmother used to say, \u0026lsquoIf the Luftwaffe are overhead then you just lie still and pretend you\u0026rsquore a cow pat\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbspThis is no idle boast.\u0026nbspGerman planes during the Second World War frequently jettisoned unused bombs over the Isle of Wight following attacks on the nearby docks at Portsmouth and Southampton.\u0026nbspAs a little boy Alec, who has an MBA and returned to the island five years ago after a career in the City, grew up in the ultimate playground.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI had my own cowboy town and didn\u0026rsquot everyone have dinosaurs in the bottom of their garden? How could anyone not have these things?\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoFrom a little boy it\u0026rsquos all I\u0026rsquove ever known. My father is 94 and he put in the dinosaurs in the 1970s.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI remember sitting on the sofa at home saying, \u0026lsquoCan we have some dinosaurs?\u0026rsquo and a year later along they came.\u0026nbspOne of Alec\u0026rsquos earliest memories is flying in a helicopter hired by BBC\u0026rsquos Blue Peter who had come to witness the first batch of prehistoric creatures being craned in.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI discovered that John Noakes smoked like a chimney but the real wonder was Mother Nature. Looking up at a dinosaur model and saying, \u0026lsquoDaddy when you said it was big, you didn\u0026rsquot say it was that big!\u0026rsquo\u0026ldquoAnd you can\u0026rsquot argue with that.\u0026nbspA few years ago Alec launched Restricted Area 5 and filled it with the largest animatronic dinosaurs in the UK, made to his specification in China.\u0026nbspIn this way he continues to follow in the footsteps of his namesake who knew it would be possible to create gardens that would appeal to the romantic Victorians but sensed that he needed to offer something more.\u0026ldquoWhen he started children were still seen and not heard, the Battle of Waterloo was barely over and tourism hadn\u0026rsquot been invented.\u0026ldquoIf I\u0026rsquod been able to ask my great-great-grandfather how big the car park was he would have said, \u0026lsquoWhat\u0026rsquos a car?\u0026rsquo Back then there wasn\u0026rsquot such a thing as a business model but there was that really positive Victorian spirit that defied convention.\u0026nbspShortly after Alexander bought his ravine a huge fin whale got stranded off The Needles, the most westerly point of the island and the showman saw his chance.\u0026nbsp                Best theme parks in the UK revealed by TripAdvisor                 Rollercoaster HORROR as girl killed when \u0026lsquopendulum ride\u0026rsquo CRASHESHe bought it at auction, sold off the blubber, had the bones bleached and displayed the skeleton to the morbid curiosity of all who visited.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBefore then you could read in a book how big a whale was but the chances were that you had never seen one or come across one, points out Alec.\u0026nbspIt proved an instant hit and the park received the ultimate endorsement 10 years later when Queen Victoria herself came to view it.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIn fact, she came four or five years in a row. Interestingly, 20 years or so later she offered a great deal of input into the building and the exhibits in the new Natural History Museum.

That\u0026rsquos the magic of Black-gang.\u0026nbspAnd that alternative way of looking at things is Alec\u0026rsquos raison d\u0026rsquoetre.\u0026nbspHe describes the thrill he gets from seeing the joy on visitors\u0026rsquo faces and the pleasure returning customers gain from stepping back into their childhoods with their own grandchildren.\u0026nbspOwner Alec Dabell said he has 25 years-worth of theme park ideas (Image: Blackgang Chine)\u0026ldquoYou get to be that little girl or boy again and if you feel younger you are younger, insists Alec, who is reluctant to disclose his own age (57) \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos the only moment during our interview when his energy dips.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOh, age is such a grown-up thing and I\u0026rsquom still playing and that\u0026rsquos what I want to encourage other people to do, he explains.\u0026nbspOne of the grown-up issues that this Peter Pan and his forebears have had to face is the erosion which has seen vast chunks of the amusement park lost to the sea over the years at nearly four metres per year.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMy great-great-grandfather may not have been much of a structural engineer or have had any understanding of soil types but you wouldn\u0026rsquot want to move it anywhere else.\u0026nbspBeing here, I just can\u0026rsquot help but smile.

You are being incredibly offensive and patronising.I think you are being deeply offensive and patronising.But the persistent caller insisted on defending his point of view, suggesting Leave voters were confused in the run-up to the 2016 referendum with arguments about European immigration towards the UK.The caller said: People who voted for Brexit are either two things: out-and-out racist or they are being led by racists.Brexit news: Andrew Pierce shut down a caller branding Leave voters racist (Image: \u0026bullLBC)It\u0026rsquos the truth.

Seriously, lots of people would say \u0026lsquowe should do best of three.\u0026rsquo What do you do then?I really don\u0026rsquot see a scenario in which a second referendum is likely or preferable.Mr Afolami also took the chance to voice his support for Theresa May and her Chequers Brexit blueprint, asking for Britons to wait and see before striking it down.Brexit news: Bim Afolami dismissed calls for a fresh vote on EU membership (Image: PARLIAMENT TV\u0026bull)Mr Afolami concluded: Before December, when we got the phase one withdrawal agreement, all sorts of people said \u0026lsquothere\u0026rsquos no way we\u0026rsquoll get there,\u0026rsquo and we got there. Before March, when we got the transition agreement agreed lots of people said \u0026lsquowe wouldn\u0026rsquot get it,\u0026rsquo and we got there.All I\u0026rsquom asking is let\u0026rsquos wait and see what the Government can produce by the end of this year or this autumn as a result of the discussion with the European Union.I personally strongly back the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers agreement, I think it\u0026rsquos sensible. I think it puts jobs first, I think it puts families first.Mrs May, who is still trying to convince the public and EU leaders of her Chequers plans\u0026rsquo proficiency, could be asked to sign even more concessions in Brussels ahead of the UK\u0026rsquos imminent ceasing of free movement and trade.It was reported that the UK\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU would echo the bloc\u0026rsquos relationship with Jersey and other Channel Islands - and allow the UK to keep a single market for goods.Government sources revealed on Thursday it was clear there had been a \u0026ldquoshift in language from the EU following the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers proposals.While Brussels would be disobeying its own rules to offer the deal, the price of the deal would be high for Britain which would have to accept the bloc\u0026rsquos rules on social policy, environmental regulations and customs rules.This would allow the EU to continue with its project of seizing control of the UK pensions market, benefits and would prevent any meaningful free trade deals with the rest of the world.

I think Brexit is the least of their difficulties. The Commission is  of the treaties, it has almost become a quasi-religion for them, \u0026lsquohow dare any country even want to leave?\u0026rsquoThe EU has got some significant problems. You\u0026rsquove got a parliamentary election next year on the backdrop of an increasing number of the countries that are concerned about the direction of travel.

Greece is obviously desperately unhappy with the situation it finds itself in.You\u0026rsquove got the Visegrad countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic increasingly working as a bloc, with concerns over the direction of travel, particularly on immigration.With all that on the background, there\u0026rsquos going to be a change of Commission, there\u0026rsquos going to be a change of President, there\u0026rsquos a lot of change in the EU.If it doesn\u0026rsquot change quickly and reflect what people are saying, I think it\u0026rsquos got real difficulties in the future. The EU you see today is going to be a very different one in 10 years time.EU news: Craig Mackinlay warned the EU Commission to change or face trouble (Image: EXPRESS.CO.UK\u0026bull)The Tory MP suggested that Brexit could become the spark kickstarting a series of withdrawals if the UK is perceived as succeeding in its EU-free future.He also argued that member states could defy the common negotiating line set by the Commission to safeguard their interests.\u0026nbspMr Mackinley added: If it is seen to be a successful history afterwards for that country that has left there could be others who want to join leaving the EU as well.I think things will change when we get down to discussing with the nation states because I don\u0026rsquot think they are all that keen for the Commission to be speaking words for them that they really don\u0026rsquot agree with.Mr Mackinlay concluded: In Germany, there are people who are working, there are MPs in Germany who need to get re-elected.If there is a tough Brexit that doesn\u0026rsquot allow for frictionless trade, it\u0026rsquoll be German workers who are put on the street and that will be the reality.We have an opportunity to change, the sooner as the negotiations get to the nation states the better because I think we\u0026rsquoll be on a different framework entirely.Mr Mackinlay is not the first Tory MP to warn Mr Juncker of the risk ignoring member states\u0026rsquo demands could pose to the EU.Nigel Evans said: \u0026ldquo I understand that the European Union are scared that if it\u0026rsquos a great success for the United Kingdom then other countries may wish to follow suit.If I were President Juncker I would look at the reason why it is that other countries are so unhappy with the European Union.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way.

I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak.

Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d never want authorities to have a free pass to snoop into our lives.But when cops are confident that the missing piece to a case can be found online, it is outrageous that web giants don’t work with them to investigate.They act as if they’re above the law.Let’s see about that.THE new Civil Society Strategy is better than its clunky name suggests.As a general rule, putting power in the hands of local people — rather than leaving it with far-off Whitehall civil servants — is usually a good idea.It is residents who know which roads need fixing, which bins need collecting, and which social care services are struggling.And for all the know-how of local councillors, too many are in safe seats and not solely motivated by serving their voters.Between plans for “citizen juries” and freeing up cash for community organisations, this should be a much-needed boost for local democracy — with the cash to back positive initiatives.The ironic thing is that it all sounds very familiar.It used to be called the Big Society.DAVID Jason reckons Del Boy would have been relaxed about Brexit.Of course he would.

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without sight of the report the family has no answer to these questions.He also said possible evidence over whether disciplinary proceedings were brought against police officers in Poland over Mr Spiers death should be heard at the inquest.Science fiction writer Monika Duvall, a friend who Mr Bates had reportedly been living with at the time of his death, was also asked to attend the inquest.Speaking afterwards, his mum Vanessa Bates said: I did not expect him to go to Poland and not come back.He should be here. He was very fit and healthy when I said goodbye to him. I miss him dreadfully.She added: I think when we get to the inquest we will know more about whether police procedures were or were not followed.I think it is going to be very difficult to get the Polish witnesses over here.Its been a long time coming, but Im just relieved that at last something is happening and there is a proper investigation and inquest.After Mr Spiers body was repatriated to the UK, doctors at a Margate hospital were unable to determine the cause of his death. An initial inquest in Canterbury opened in December 2016 when the court heard he vomited two litres of black fluid, but the inquest was adjourned last year.The court heard Mr Spiers had been on holiday was a friend in Cyprus before heading to Poland where he was speaking at a conference.Shortly before his death, Mr Spiers was said to have been probing into the lives of well-known figures in politics, business and entertainment.At the time his mum Vanessa said she feared the worst: I think Max had been digging in some dark places and somebody wanted him dead.Her theory was shared by many online, with other conspiracy theorists, UFO investigators and bloggers calling the circumstances of Mr Spiers death suspicious.At the time, Coroner Alan Blunsdon told the court he was still awaiting a report from Polish authorities, adding that the workload of Kent Police may delay forensic analysis of Mr Spiers phone and computer.Coroner Christopher Sutton Mattocks set the date of January 7 for the four-day inquest, which will be heard at the Archbishops Palace in Maidstone.He said: It is extremely important that when we start everybody is completely ready for this and we have all the information available."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425530294.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"heatwave and world cup combine economy","story":"Higher household spending helped overcome a worrying fall in exports and a manufacturing recession.And business investment rose despite fears of a crash in confidence due to the Brussels deadlock.The ONS said growth hit 0.4 per cent in the three months to June – against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The World Cup, the Royal Wedding and warm weather got consumers spending on beers and barbecues.“But higher energy bills and petrol prices, and a backdrop of weak wage growth, suggests the shackles are still on the UK economy.” Others warned growth was “anaemic”.The trade deficit widened from £4.7billion to £8.6billion in the three months to May on a notable fall in exports to non-EU nations.Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted the Government wasn’t complacent.He announced a £1billion business innovation fund to generate more high-tech jobs on a visit to Coventry.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the country was paying the price for Tory austerity.He stormed: “Councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Pound.

That’s one of the great pull factors.“Leaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.“We need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.”But CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie rejected Mr Duncan Smith’s assessment.He said: “The suggestion that British businesses do not even bother to look at British workers to fill roles is wholly detached from reality and needlessly provocative to the thousands of firms across the UK facing labour and skills shortages.“Businesses are trying to have a balanced, honest debate about a new immigration system for the UK.“We need to build this model from facts, not fantasy.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn

guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be

feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for

uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

I didn’t know what was happening because everything was black.There’s so many power cuts in Donabate as it is so I thought it was that, but deep down I knew there was something wrong.So, I crawled my way out of the bedroom and my husband Paul is a taxi driver and thank God he came in [home] and he started screaming and he rang an ambulance.“My sight was gone, completely gone. The whole place was black. My eye was being pushed out by the parasite.Suzanne had been in the shower when the Acanthamoeba parasite crawled behind her contact lens.The organism is usually found in bodies of water such as lakes but also swims in domestic tap water, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air and affects contact lens wearers.Doctors managed to kill the nerves and clean them so thankfully Suzannes sight was saved.But she explained the pain was like a searing hot knife through my eye.Suzanne also claims the warm weather is to blame for the worms being in the water.The parasite is usually found in bodies of water (lakes, oceans and rivers) as well as domestic tap water, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air.Humans come into contact with them when we wash, swim and drink water but they can cause a serious eye disease if they infect the cornea.AK is most common in people who wear contact lenses, but anyone with a corneal injury could develop the infection.The mum said: It can only happen a contact lens wearer because the contact lens creates a vacuum in the eye.

The Egyptian floated the business on the stock market again nine years later, minus Harrods, which had been its most valuable asset.By the late 1990s, struggling to compete with the new out-of-town shopping outlets that had lured shoppers away from the traditional high street locations from which it traded, House of Fraser was labouring under heavy debts.The solution of John Coleman, its chief executive at the time, was to strike a deal in July 1999 that saw the freeholds of 15 of the group\u0027s stores sold and then leased back.Unfortunately, a store freehold can only be sold once and the sale-and-leaseback agreement tied House of Fraser into some onerous rental agreements, some of which went out 40 years.In the meantime, the group continued to be a consolidator in the sector, snapping up rivals such as Beatties, the Midlands department store operator and Jenners, based in Edinburgh.Some, like Jenners and Dickins \u0026 Jones, have retained their names but, along the way, other famous old brands owned by House of Fraser have been replaced with the latter brand.The last Army \u0026 Navy stores, for example, were rechristened House of Fraser in 2005 stores previously trading under the name Binns, largely in the North East of England, were nearly all rebranded by 2006 and DH Evans was rebranded as long ago as 2001. These rebrandings in many cases severed a link between the stores and communities in which they had traded for many years and confused older shoppers.The next chapter came when, in 2006, House of Fraser was bought by the Icelandic group Baugur. The latter went bust three years later, in the wake of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland\u0027s economy, with Baugur\u0027s shares being scattered among a group of Icelandic banks.By then House of Fraser was in the middle of a turnaround under John King, the former Matalan boss, who had joined in early 2007 and Don McCarthy, an experienced retailer who became chairman under Baugur.But in 2013, the business changed hands again, being bought by the Chinese retailer Sanpower for a remarkable \u0026#163480m. Mr McCarthy left almost immediately and the talented Mr King, who had been promised the chairmanship by the new owners, left at the beginning of 2015 when that pledge went unfulfilled.The Chinese have proved to be as poor owners of House of Fraser as Mr Fayed was. Promised investment has never materialised, experienced managers have left the business and the group was left in no fit state to face either the hurricanes buffeting the high street or the intensification of competition as both John Lewis and Debenhams sought to respond to changing consumer tastes."},{"url":null,"title":"susie boniface tory austerity left","story":"NewsopinionSusie Boniface: Tory austerity has left UK councils potlessNorthampton\u0027s local paper has revealed the council is a total of £1BILLION in debt, and it’s not the only one in the UK that\u0027s drowningShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySusie Boniface20:12, 10 AUG 2018NewsopinionTories will never be able to drag penniless councils out of the hole they\u0027ve put them in through cutsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere\u0027s nothing more fascinatingly idiotic than Tory maths. In April, Theresa May sent \u0026shygovernment commissioners into Northamptonshire County Council after it overspent by \u0026pound20million, saying the council wasn’t getting proper value for taxpayer money. In the three months since, the projected overspend for this year has jumped to \u0026pound70m – that’s 333% worse. And Theresa can’t blame profligate lefties because Northamptonshire has been blue since 2005. Tory maths meant this week \u0026shycouncillors met to decide whether to cut services for children or the \u0026shydisabled. County Hall is up for sale, the winter gritting fleet has been slashed, and 21 libraries need \u0026shyvolunteers to stay open. The local paper has revealed the council is a total of \u0026pound1BILLION in debt, and it’s not the only one.  East Sussex County Council has already warned it will have to reduce services to the legal minimum, and the National Audit Office said earlier this year that 1 in 10 local authorities would have burned through savings by 2021. Tory maths means Theresa won’t bail out Northamptonshire – which owes most of the debt to the \u0026shygovernment’s loan board anyway – because it means she would have to do the same for everyone. Yet this is a problem which affects some of the most important things in our lives – bins, roads, social care, schools and planning. Tory maths produced austerity, which multiplied by eight years means the local authorities that 65 million people rely on are now potless. But Tory maths means those already doing quite nicely get to do better. Bureaucrats at the Department for \u0026shyInternational Trade, which is in charge of post-Brexit trade deals, got bonuses totalling \u0026pound542,775 last year – without a single trade deal to show for it.

On Saturday, March 20, 1993, the day before Mother\u0027s Day, an IRA bomb exploded without warning in a rubbish bin in Warrington\u0027s Bridge Street shopping area. Three-year-old Jonathan Ball was killed instantaneously. Moments later a second bomb exploded, seriously injuring 50 people and claiming the life of another child, 12-year-old Tim Parry, who died in hospital five days later after his parents, Colin and Wendy, had to take the unimaginable step of turning off his life-support machine. The reaction worldwide to what happened in Warrington was one of revulsion and locally anger was directed at the Irish community. Across the Irish Sea, however, the anger manifested itself into something unexpected and uplifting and it forms the basis of a new BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day.  The killing of the two innocent boys was a step to far for many who by their silence had supported the armed struggle. At the time Susan McHugh, then 37, was an ordinary wife and mother living in Clontarf, Dublin. After hearing of the Warrington tragedy, she said she felt the impulse to pick up the phone to book a hall at Trinity College, Dublin and later announced on the radio phone-in Liveline the holding of a protest meeting. She voiced her indignation as an Irish citizen about what had been committed in her name She asked people to join her at a public meeting at TCD on March 24 - 1,000 attended.  Her rallying speech At the time, the mum of two said: The IRA did not kill Johnathan Ball in my name or in your name. I want to tell the world tonight they did not kill him in the name of Ireland. There\u0027s nothing wrong with being emotional about a little baby\u0027s death. I feel horror, revulsion and sadness. But that\u0027s not enough. Tonight I feel anger. I feel angry and frustrated because the political will is not there to end the violence. We\u0027ve listened too long to rhetoric with no results. Sincere people will say everything has been tried. Maybe it\u0027s time it was looked at from a different angle.  Maybe it\u0027s time we asked for UN troops and independent arbitrators from Europe or the outside world. She appealed to politicians of all parties on both sides of the border. \u0027\u0027We demand an immediate peace plan . . . tonight is a night to remember,\u0027\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027We, the silent majority, say enough is enough.\u0027\u0027 The peace rally A peace rally in O\u0027Connell Street followed, attended by 20,000 people. It was a pivotal moment the launch of the Peace Consensus and a demonstration of people power, as journalist Bernie Ni Fhlatharta put it, that would do something the politicians had failed to do: kick-start the peace process and ultimately remake the political landscape of Northern Ireland. Across the country scores of people signed books of condolence in churches around Ireland and thousands of bouquets of flowers were transported by the Irish Air Corps to the funeral of Jonathan Ball. At one rally McHugh shouted: Please, please, please, make it stop! She was cheered by grim-faced people standing near the post office in the rain, many wearing white ribbons for peace.  Enough is enough In an interview before the demonstration she said: I\u0027m only saying what the majority of people in the country say. Enough is enough. We don\u0027t want any more deaths. We want a cease-fire. At the time she was lionized by the media as the leader of a new peace movement, but she insisted: I\u0027m an ordinary mum, a housewife. It was a dramatic time as the world searched for an end to violence and is seen by some as the moment peace seemed within reach. A year later the IRA announced a ceasefire, it was not to last, but it was the beginning of the end. Is Mother\u0027s Day true?  Now a BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day will tell the story of McHugh, played by Vicky McClure (Line of Duty, The Replacement) and Wendy Parry, played by Anna Maxwell Martin (Motherland, Good Omens) the mother of 12 year old Tim Parry who lost his life in the attack.

The world famous UFO expert had vomited two litres of black liquid before he died when he was on a trip to Poland to attend a conference.  Mr Spiers\u0027s laptop was wiped when Polish authorities returned it after his death more than two years ago. Around the time of his death, it was said that he had been probing into the lives of well-known figures in politics, business and entertainment.  Alarm bells rang for his mum, Vanessa Bates, after she received a text which read: Your boy\u0027s in trouble, if anything happens to me, investigate. Today a pre-inquest review at Guildhall in Sandwich, Kent, heard how the contents of his SIM card were also of particular interest.  The barrister for Mr Spiers\u0027s mother, Adam Taylor, has called for members of the Polish emergency services to appear as witnesses in the inquest.  Mr Taylor stated that his laptop was wiped but that it was not empty at the time of his death.  His body was returned to the UK but his laptop and phone were held by Polish police. During that time, Ms Bates said: I think Max had been digging in some dark places and somebody wanted him dead. An initial inquest opened in December 2016 when the court heard he vomited the black fluid whilst he was in Poland after holidaying in Cyprus for a week. In a statement, coroner\u0027s investigations officer Caroline O\u0027Donnell said: When they returned, Mr Spiers became ill with a high temperature and was weak.  The following day, Mr Spiers vomited two litres of black fluid. The friend called a doctor who attempted resuscitation before pronouncing him dead.  Authorities in Poland also said that the bizarre death was due to natural causes. Doctors at a Margate Hospital were unable to determine the cause of his death.  He was heard slurring to other conspiracy theorists in Poland before he was found lifeless on a sofa. His girlfriend Sarah Adams, 31, from Kent, said the pair were due to get married and have a baby when he came back to England. She claimed he was forced to call her in secret after being held against his will in Warsaw.

Linda Carolan, 50, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer seven years ago but last week was admitted to a critical care ward suffering from both pneumonia and sepsis .  A desperately sick Linda admitted to staff at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth her dying wish was to marry her partner Marcus Fellows, aged 46. Doctors were worried she wouldn’t survive so, determined to make her wish come true, ward staff rushed to organise a ceremony. Critical Care Consultant David Slessor contacted the local registry office and the team even went so far as to buy Linda a dress at a local charity shop and to decorate the area around her bedside.  Just hours after her prognosis, Mrs Fellowes - wearing a pink wedding dress - married her partner in a small ceremony on the ward with flowers, balloons and Prosecco. The couple, who live in West Meon, Petersfield, Hants, with their 12-year-old son, said staff at the hospital were “incredible”. Mr Fellowes said: “The doctor wrote a letter to the registry office and they said they could be at the hospital within the hour. “Staff went to a charity shop to buy Linda a nice dress while others went to buy Prosecco, balloons and decorations. “It was incredible what they did for us, they made it a massive celebration and everyone wanted to get involved and do their part. “Everyone was so jubilant and you could tell they were happy for us. “In the darkest moment of our lives, the hospital staff stepped in and helped in more ways than we could imagine. “Not only did they save Linda’s life but they fulfilled her last request.” Linda, now Mrs Fellows, saw a dramatic improvement in her health following the wedding and has not moved off intensive care to a respiratory ward.

Sweet memories of getting to know each other in our first year make me smile. Michael smiles too because it was the year Newcastle enjoyed their Kevin Keegan peak.

I worked in the toy department, getting paid to talk to cute kids and build Lego displays. And on a sweet kiosk, where staff could eat damaged stock.

Children shout and scream with delight as it halts expectantly on the edge of the drop. As the only adult on the ride, surrounded by no one over the age of 10, I’m feeling a little silly. But as soon as the Cliffhanger rollercoaster takes the plunge, I forget all about that and I am transported back to when I was last at Blackgang Chine as a 10-year-old myself. The wacky and wonderful attraction, embedded on the stunning cliffs on the south of the island, celebrates its 175th birthday on Wednesday and is Britain’s oldest amusement park.  Despite my fellow passengers, Blackgang Chine is not just for children. Not wanting to grow up is a theme which runs deep through the park and its owner, Alec Dabell, whose great-great grandfather Alexander Dabell founded the park in 1843, is perfect proof of this. Alec may be in his late 50s, but he is like a real life Peter Pan. As he shows me around the park, I ask whether he likes to go on the rides. “Well of course, I have a go on the rides every morning,” he says with a grin, then quickly adds: “You’re not supposed to know that.”  Owning a theme park would be a dream job for many, but not for Alec. “Jobs are for grown-ups, this is not a job. I haven’t grown up yet, I’m not allowed to grow up. “If the park is not making me smile, if it’s not fun all the time, then is it going to make anyone else smile? “And if it’s not going to make them smile, then we’ve got it wrong.” Blackgang Chine gets its name from the blue slipper clay the lands rests upon, which can be quite muddy and black in colour. A “gang” means a walk way, while the Chine, a coastal ravine, has long since eroded away.  Alec said of Alexander: “It’s a shame he built the park on blue slipper clay – but I wouldn’t swap it for anywhere. “The Isle of Wight is the most beautifully varied 144 square miles this country has to offer. We are guilty of one thing, keeping it quiet.” The vision of Britain’s first theme park began when Alexander bought the carcass of a dead Fin whale that had been stranded off the Needles. He then decide to display the skeleton in Blackgang, formerly landscaped gardens designed to attract the first Victorian visitors. Soon more and more flocked to the park, including Queen Victoria and Albert, who Alec believes drew inspiration from the whale exhibition.  Standing beneath the huge skeleton, Alec says: “This is pure speculation, but Victoria came in 1853 and 20 years later London’s Natural History Museum arrived with a lot of input from them. And what was the first exhibit? A whale. “I wonder where they got that idea from! This is a wonder of nature. You could read about a whale and how big it was. But until you physically see it, you wouldn’t know. So that is what we did.” When Queen Mary visited in the 1920s, she bumped her head on the whale’s jawbone and it knocked her hat off. Within minutes a man appeared and sawed off the offending piece of bone.  Remarkably, Blackgang stayed open during both world wars. Alec says: “We had quite a lot damage because they’d bomb Southampton and Portsmouth and on the way back to France, get rid of all their bombs. “My grandmother told me the Luftwaffe came to bomb radar sites in Ventnor. “They flew right over Blackgang and she’d tell my father ‘get down and pretend to be a cow pat’ – so they don’t bomb you.” Blackgang is the third oldest theme park in the world after Bakken in Denmark, open in 1583 and Prater in Austria which dates from 1766. Alec adds: “The other two closed during the war so I’d argue we’re actually the oldest as we’ve been doing it continually for 175 years.” He shows me around its 44 acres, from the singing DoDo display and Cowboy Town to the Underwater Kingdom, with the enthusiasm of an excited eight-year-old. A favourite spot is Restricted Area 5, where a 25ft T-Rex roars at terrified kids.

Arthur King has lived through two world wars and read the paper for more than 80 years, doing the puzzle each day to keep his mind sharp. He said: “I’ve been reading the Daily Mirror since I was a young man. “I love it because it’s the best newspaper out there and it’s a Labour paper and the crossword is my favourite thing to do.”  On his 100th birthday his granddaughter gave the retired clerk an original Mirror from the day he was born – on August 8, 1913, when King George V was on the throne. And Arthur, who lives in Reading, Berks, even tried to do the crossword in that.  The dad-of-two – who served as an anti-aircraft gunner during the Second World War – said he has been a Labour Party supporter his whole life and the Daily Mirror is the only paper for him.  His parents James and Catherine were Mirror readers and Labour supporters too. “I couldn’t imagine reading anything else,” said Arthur.  “It’s what’s kept my mind so sharp all these years. I’ll read it and do the crossword until I die.” Arthur’s daughter, Wendy Levey, said: “He has been reading the Mirror for as long as I can remember, every day for probably more than 80 years. “Every day he has it delivered and sits down to make his way through it. “Dad’s not quite as good as he used to be at completing the crosswords, but he gives it his best effort, which at 105 I think is all you can ask for. “He likes it because he’s been a Labour supporter his whole life and it’s a Labour newspaper. Dad still pays his Labour membership to this day. “His eyes aren’t what they used to be, but I think the crossword keeps his mind sharp. “On his 100th birthday, my daughter managed to get a copy of the Daily Mirror printed on the day he was born – it was such an amazing present.  “We had it photocopied because it was so delicate and I think he may even have tried to do the crossword in that as well.” The front page reported the death of flight pioneer Samuel Franklin Cody who was killed test flying his latest design, the Cody Floatplane, which broke up at 200ft and also killed cricketer William Evans. Arthur was the youngest of nine children, with three sisters and five brothers. He grew up close to Tottenham Hotspur’s football stadium in North London. He still supports them today. He moved to Caversham, Reading, for work when he was 24, just before the start of the Second World War, and that is where he met his wife Jessie.  The pair worked for different firms in the same street and met while cycling in one day. They married a year later in 1940 and spent their honeymoon cycling around Devon and Cornwall – a hobby they shared for six decades. Soon after they wed, Arthur volunteered for the Army and was stationed in Southampton as an anti-aircraft gunner. His job was to load large ammunition shells into the guns, which would be used to bring down German bombers attacking oil refineries and ships. After his unit was hit by a German bomb he was transferred to an army base in Iceland, where he worked in telecoms.  After the war he returned to Reading, where he and Jessie started jobs as clerks for the Royal Corps of Signals, organising military records for over three decades until they retired in the late 1980s. The pair were both Labour Party members and voted for them in every election. They had two daughters, Wendy and Christine, who went on to have six children between them.

Harry travelled to the African country without wife Meghan earlier this week to meet senior staff and workers from the organisation Rhino Conservation Botswana (RCB). Botswana is helping to safeguard the continent\u0027s population of black and white rhino and the duke takes a keen interest in the RCB\u0027s work as its UK patron. It is understood Harry attended a meeting with senior staff on Wednesday and later that day toured a project in a village.  The private trip follows a similar visit he made to the country in January when he carried out another fact-finding mission to learn about the charity\u0027s latest developments. Botswana is a country Harry knows and loves and where he took his wife in the early days of their relationship.

The Duke of Sussex reportedly called Thomas Markle Snr at his home in Rosarito, Mexico, to ask if he’d been working with a photographer after growing suspicious over an increasing number of photos.  Veteran royal photographer Arthur Edwards claims Harry’s now father-in-law assured him he had not.  It led to a statement being made by Kensington Palace through the press watchdog asking for the 74-year-old’s privacy to be respected.  But less than 48 hours later, Markle was exposed when CCTV footage of him setting up the pictures with a British paparazzi emerged. Meghan Markle\u0027s rise to royalty in pictures - from starry-eyed child to Duchess of Sussex Speaking on a BBC Radio Kent phone-in show hosted by Prince Harry\u0027s biographer Duncan Larcombe, Edwards said Markle\u0027s denial caused “embarrassment” to the Prince. He explained: “Harry spoke to the father direct and said have you been cooperating with the paparazzi. He said no. The Palace put out a statement on Friday night saying to respect his privacy. Harry had been reassured by the father it was not going on.”  The Prince, 33, had grown suspicious after four sets of pictures emerged in a newspaper which appeared to be set up. They showed Markle reading a book on Britain, working out on an exercise bike, being measured for a suit and surfing the internet looking at pictures of his daughter. Edwards added: “We knew the father was colluding with the paparazzi. Everyone in the business knows that. When he was in the library, looking at the TV screen and they happen to be there. “You don\u0027t get measured up for a suit in a shop window. “He told him he had not colluded.

The Newcastle United owner snapped up the department store giant for \u0026pound90million – safeguarding jobs for now – and vowing to take it upmarket.  But there was no word on the long-term future of House of Fraser’s 16,000 strong workforce – 5,900 hired directly and 10,100 by in-store concessions. And around 10,000 members of the chain’s pension fund face being short changed because of the way it was sold. Mr Ashley’s Sports Direct empire bought House of Fraser after it collapsed into administration yesterday.  It marked the biggest high street failure since Woolworths went bust a decade ago with the loss of 27,000 jobs, and BHS two years ago, when 11,000 workers got the chop. Mr Ashley failed to give a firm pledge on jobs at House of Fraser. He said only: “We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible.” His comments failed to convince union chiefs who have criticised Sports Direct’s alleged treatment of workers. Scott Lennon, of Unite, said: “Sports Direct is a leopard that has not changed its spots and we hope its poor record on pay and employment practices are not transferred to the House of Fraser.  “We fear for jobs and employment conditions at the House of Fraser going forward. The staff are entering a period of great uncertainty and worry.” Dave Gill, of shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: “It is crucial that staff are treated with dignity and fairness.” Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: “People are being treated shabbily. It’s disgusting and they deserve a lot better.” The \u0026pound90million sale price comes despite the business having assets of nearly \u0026pound950million as of January. But the chain had racked up heavy losses and was lumbered with \u0026pound400million debts – leaving it due to close 31 of its 59 stores. Those plans are up in the air after the deal with Sports Direct, which already owned an 11% stake in House of Fraser. Attention immediately turned to what Mike Ashley would do with the business.  The 53-year-old maverick tycoon has gone from opening a sports shop at 18 in 1981 to overseeing a retail empire and amassing a \u0026pound2.8billion fortune. He has also snapped up older sports brands, Slazenger and Dunlop. Sports Direct also owns a big stake in Debenhams, another struggling chain, as well as Goals Soccer Centres and online fashion firm MySale. Yesterday’s deal was seen by some as Mr Ashley staking a claim as king of the high street. It appeared plans include turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct or Flannels, its upmarket fashion chain. Mr Ashley said: “It is vital we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands. “My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street.”  As it happens, House of Fraser owned upmarket London store Harrods between 1957 and 1994. Mr Ashley previously vowed to turn Sports Direct into the “Selfridges of sport”, in a reference to the department store chain. House of Fraser was bought by Sports Direct in a controversial deal, known as pre-pack administration. This normally involves a buyer snapping-up a business, minus its debts and pension fund. It is believed the 10,000 members in House of Fraser’s two main defined benefit pension schemes – which have an more than \u0026pound160million shortfall under a “buy-out” valuation – will likely transfer to an insurance firm. However, members who have yet to give up work could see their pension pots cut and those who have retired will get smaller annual increases. But expert John Ralfe said members were better off than if the schemes ended up with the Pension Protection Fund rescue body.  “The bad news is that even this higher level will be less than the full pension promise members expected,” he said. It is understood administrators at accountancy firm EY, and House of Fraser’s banks, chose Mr Ashley over a more than \u0026pound100million offer from rival billionaire Philip Day. The option put forward by Dubai-based Mr Day, who owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain, would have avoided an administration and included House of Fraser’s pension scheme. Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, warned: “Turning around the business will not come easy. The stores are failing to attract sustainable levels of footfall while battling against rising operating costs and shifts in shopper behaviour.” Analyst Mr Hyman estimated 90% of House of Fraser’s stock was owned by in-store concessions, rather than the firm itself.  House of Fraser’s collapse came four years after Chinese firm Sanpower, controlled by chain-smoking deal maker Yuan Yafei, bought 89% of the business for \u0026pound480million. Plans to open a chain of House of Fraser stores in China flopped. Mr Yuan, one of China’s 100 richest people and who amassed a big collection of Chinese art, had planned to sell a 51% stake in the chain to C.banner, a Hong Kong-listed footwear retailer, run by his brother-in-law Chen Yixi. That deal fell through, ultimately triggering House of Fraser’s collapse.

Olivia Golding, 24, would reportedly consume up to 15 balloons every weekend while her three-year-old son Parker visited his dad. She says the nitrous oxide (NOS) inside has left her with no feeling in most of her body after she contracted a Lichtheim\u0027s disease, also known as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. She is having to relearn how to walk and use her hands. Olivia first became aware of the problem last Friday, when she woke up unable to move and had to ask Parker to get her phone so she could call her help.  The car saleswoman from Bristol, told the Mail Online : About a month before I was doing a balloon and I got pins and needles in my neck and back. I started feeling numb in my body. But I never dreamt it was the balloons so I just carried on doing them. One day I was walking in the park with my son and taking him swimming, the next day I couldn\u0027t move. She was admitted to Bristol\u0027s Southmead Hospital, where tests revealed the top of her spinal cord was damaged. They asked me if I took NOS and I was like, \u0027Sure, I\u0027ve done a lot of them\u0027, she said. Olivia added: I cannot even put Parker\u0027s shoes on for him and it\u0027s the things like that [which] break my heart. My son wants me to play with him and I can\u0027t do that. I can\u0027t feel my legs, my whole body is twitching. Olivia has been using her recovery period to warn others about the dangers of NOS. Writing on Facebook, she said: I wanted to write this on social media to make awareness to all of my friends that also use balloons of what the balloon is actually doing to your body. If this just stops one person from doing them, I feel I would have succeeded in some way. I think we have all become almost expectant to the fact of seeing balloons being sold at festivals, on the streets and even in night clubs. Over the past month my body has slowly been becoming numb, deteriorating in front of me, getting to the point last week that I no longer could move my hands or even dress myself.  The nitrous oxide that is put into the balloon that we all crave for is actually starving your brain of oxygen and eating away at your nervous system - after having brain scans and MRI along with fluid taken from my spine I’ve now been diagnosed with my nervous system as damaged, I have no feeling in my body from my calves to my shoulders and cannot use my hands. The doctors are now going to focus on trying to reverse this but I wanted to make everyone aware that the 20 second high off that one balloon could cause you weeks in hospital teaching yourself to walk properly again. Please think of the consequences and raise awareness of nitrous oxide. In another post, she described how she is unable to move without assistance and is having to use a wheelchair to get around the hospital. My treatment has begun so now it’s a waiting game of the reversibility and the praying that it’s reversible, she added. The doctors have asked me to get the message out there about nitrous oxide and what they are doing to peoples bodies. I understand most people will look at this post and think ‘it won’t happen to me’ but I thought that when I was sat with my friends and going to festivals until I woke up last week unable to move. It’s really not worth it, so anyone, especially my friends, I’m begging you to stop as you do not want the feeling (or no feeling shall I say) of what me and my family are going through. Lichtheim\u0027s disease is thought to start when nitrous oxide starves the body of the vitamin B12 by stopping it being properly absorbed. The lack of vitamin B12 damages the fatty sheath protecting nerve fibres in the spinal cord which control movement and sensation. The condition is treated with vitamin B12 injections – which Olivia is receiving – and most people recover completely if this happens within a few weeks of symptoms starting. However, if treatment is delayed they may not recover from the movement problems caused by the irreversible damage to their nervous system. After a week in hospital, Olivia has managed to take 12 steps with help of physiotherapists. She is expected to spend a significant time in hospital with long term rehabilitation. It is illegal to supply or import NOS for human consumption, but the small silver canisters are still available in shops as they are legally used for whipping cream and as an anaesthetic.

Lindsey Goldrick Dean, 48, fell victim to a campaign of abuse and intimidation by a man she met online after placing an advertisement on a dating site back in 2004. Mum-of-one Lindsey, then aged 34, struck up a lively email correspondence with businessman Paul Curran, finding him to be a funny and articulate potential partner. However it was not to be - the pair embarked on several dates but Lindsey concluded that the chemistry was not there and decided to end the fledgling romance. Unknown to Lindsey, this would mark the start of 14 years of psychological torture by her spurned partner. Curran set up dozens of websites in Lindsey\u0027s name, filling them with sexual content, vile abuse and slurs.   At one stage he even paid for an advertisement which displayed Lindsey\u0027s name in Google search results accompanied by a link to a website which contained sickening insults.  Curran also sent emails and letters to family and friends after uncovering their contact details, even sending ashes to her mother\u0027s home. Police arrested and cautioned Curran but could do little to stem the seemingly endless stream of abuse. Because he spent much of his time abroad due to his work as a technology consultant, authorities were often powerless to prevent him from continuing his online attacks. After being granted legal aid two years ago, Lindsey summoned the courage to pursue Curran in the courts which culminated in a High Court case this month which ultimately ruled that he must pay his victim substantial damages.   I was willing to risk bankruptcy to be out of his control, she told the Daily Mail . He could have offered me a million pounds and I would still have said no. It was the principle.  He hijacked my privacy, my energy and my confidence and the lengths he went to do so were simply extraordinary. There were times when I thought I would never be free of him. I felt helpless. Lindsey now lives near Yeovil in Somerset with her husband and 9-year-old son and says she is finally free of Curran.

She was found dead by her social worker, Leanne Palethorpe, who had rushed to her home after receiving a series of worrying emails. She was found slumped against a wall, wrapped in a duvet and clutching her teddy bear after taking her own life. Above her were detailed notes to her family and a playlist titled \u0027suicide\u0027 was playing.

But after about a year things came to an end, and the newly-single heir to the throne was told to go out and find an appropriate future princess. Pressure was building on him to settle down, so he began a decade of dating in a bid to find someone his family, and the public, would approve of. It wasn\u0027t easy, and it\u0027s believed he dated more than 20 women before he finally found Diana Spencer. There were a host of interesting characters along the way, including Diana\u0027s older sister Lady Sarah Spencer.

James suggested the pair meet for lunch when they got back to London, and she accepted. He said: Unfortunately another reporter overheard our exchange and also invited himself along, which added gooseberry to the menu. Sarah was disarmingly frank about her boyfriend and declared she would not marry Charles if he were the dustman or the King of England.  That was good news from where I was sitting and Sarah seemed delighted I was so keen to share it with the nation. But when Charles found out, he wasn\u0027t happy.

Gaynor Kingston planned to spend five days in the holiday resort in Southport with her partner and their three young children, but found the filthy chalet so unbearable they left the next morning. The family of five, who spent \u0026pound138 on the trip and travelled for three hours from East Yorkshire, say they discovered dirty bathwater, a bin full of rubbish, dirty dishes, stained mattresses and a pungent smell of cigarette smoke when they arrived at their holiday home. The 30-year-old told the Liverpool Echo : On the table there was a half drunk coffee, in the bathroom there was a bathtub filled with someone else’s dirty bath water.  The floors were sticky. The mattresses looked like they had never been washed. The quilts had rips in and we didn\u0027t have enough pillows. The fridge had the previous tenants food in and the kitchen work tops had not been cleaned. My daughter was even bitten a few times in the room. It was literally like walking around the set of Shameless. Despite paying for two rooms, the family say they were only given the filthy one-bed apartment. Gaynor, who has two-year-old twins and a five-year-old daughter, said she went to reception to complain. But instead of receiving an apology she claims she was told she would have to pay an extra \u0026pound52 for a room upgrade.  She added: They said they had no two bedroom rooms available to move us to, of the same category and to move to a two bed, I had to pay an extra \u0026pound52. I asked a cleaner on my way to the reception if it was my responsibility to clean the chalet and she confirmed it wasn’t. Reception staff told me the cleaners were running late and hadn’t I been informed? I said I had checked in and nobody had mentioned a thing to me. Gaynor said the family had to wait until 6.30pm until the cleaners arrived. She said: I was ready to go home at that point but stuck it out for the sake of the kids.

Over the weekend and the next few days, the remains of Storm Debby is set to sweep in from the Atlantic bringing with it heavy rain, gales and floods. It has been estimated that as much as 20mm to 30mm of rain will fall in an hour, bringing with it thunder storms and large hail. However this is not the end of the glorious sunshine for the year as next weekend the heatwave will return and remain until the end of the summer. Temperatures will widely move back to the 30 degree region with a record of 38.6C set to blast the country. Weather models show the risk of storms will continue across much of the country to the middle of August.  Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell warned many places will see heavy rain this weekend after a brief respite on Saturday morning.  She said to The Express : “Much of the UK will wake to a chillier morning on Saturday and it will turn cloudier through the day with outbreaks of rain moving from the west which could turn heavy.  “Later in the day the weather will be influenced by the remains of Tropical Storm Debby, air associated with this storm will get caught up with a low-pressure system bringing higher temperatures and some heavier rain and wind. “Much of the UK will see outbreaks of heavy rain on Sunday and it will continue to be breezy, it is a generally unsettled picture through next week.  “People with outdoor plans should perhaps try to squeeze them in on Saturday morning.” Early forecasts show the possibility of a return to warmer, drier and sunnier conditions later this month, she added. She said: “There are some models pointing towards an increased chance of more settled, sunnier weather towards the end of next weekend. “We are also seeing signs of a more prolonged spell of settled weather and there is a chance that all of the UK could see more in the way of sunshine and warm temperatures towards the end of the month.” Travel disruption is expected with the chaotic weather as well as damage to homes. The south-west of England and Wales are due to experience local flooding from surface water over the weekend. There is a silver lining, according to long-range forecasters who say the heat is set to return. This will begin during the middle of the month and will continue throughout the rest of summer and into autumn.

The company said it will be closing manufacturing operations in Italy and Mexcio and will outsource production to an as yet undisclosed country, a statement said. The announcement comes as shuttered 28 of its stores worldwide - with plans to close a further 132 stores later this year. The company currently has 558 stores worldwide. It was also said that current CFO, Carrie Teffner, will be leaving the business in March of this year and will be replaced by Anne Mehlman, the finance chief of Zappos.  The company - headquartered in Niwot, Colorado nearly 30 miles outside of Denver - focuses on its signature breathable plastic foam clogs and became a hit in the mid noughties. In recent years, the Crocs has fallen out of favour with shoppers and saw its share price halve between 2014 and 2017, reaching a low of $5.94. Crocs has seen a stronger financial performance in intervening years on the back of successful innovations and an improved marketing strategy.  The company expects revenue to be just over $1bn for 2018, just below analysts expectations. Andrew Rees, CEO and president, said: Our clogs and sandals continue to perform well, and we are well positioned for the back half of the year. We expect double digit e-commerce growth and moderate wholesale growth to more than offset lower retail revenues due to operating fewer stores and business model changes.

Dewayne Johnson, 48, was awarded the extraordinary sum after a California jury ruled on Friday that the Monsanto\u0027s \u0027Roundup\u0027 product resulted him to develop non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. A former pest control manager for a California county school system, Johnson, 46, applied the weed killer up to 30 times per year. In court, doctors for the plaintiff claimed that the former school groundsman has just months to live. The simple fact is he is going to die. It\u0027s just a matter of time, his legal team told the jury in his opening statement last month.  Following the judgment, a clearly emotional Johson was seen smiling and hugging his lawyers. Dewayne is the first of hundreds of claimants who say the weedkiller caused cancer. Chemicals giant Monsanto, a unit of Bayer AG, faces more than 5,000 similar lawsuits across the United States.  The jury at San Francisco\u0027s Superior Court of California deliberated for three days before finding that Monsanto had failed to warn Johnson and other consumers of the cancer risks posed by its weed killers. It awarded $39 million in compensatory and $250 million in punitive damages. This jury found Monsanto acted with malice and oppression because they knew what they were doing was wrong and doing it with reckless disregard for human life, said Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Johnson\u0027s lawyer. This should send a strong message to the boardroom of Monsanto.

Jordan Holgerson suffered five broken ribs, a lung injury and several abrasions after falling from Moulton Falls on the Lewis River in Yacolt, Washington, in the US. The 16-year-old was caught on camera standing nervously at the edge of the bridge before her friend pushed her from behind. She was heard telling her friends \u0027no\u0027 twice in the video, but the group took no notice and forced her to take the plunge. Speaking to Mail Online, Jordan\u0027s aunt Kristie Morgan said her niece is suffering physically and emotionally having left hospital. She is having a hard time breathing and experiencing panic attacks. But despite the pain, Kristie said Jordan does not want \u0027revenge\u0027.  The aunt: Jordan is truly the sweetest girl in the world. She doesn\u0027t wish to seek revenge on her friend. But in my opinion her friend needs to learn a lesson. She could have killed her and it wouldn\u0027t be a question at all if she was in trouble for her actions. She would be in jail right now. But that is how Jordan feels. Jordan sister, Vanessa, spoke to KOIN in Canada shortly after the incident. I think she [the friend] tried to do it jokingly and didn\u0027t think what could have happened, Vanessa said. You don\u0027t really play around at 60 feet. Her other sister Kaytlin added: Friends don\u0027t push someone from that high, so I was pissed.  Kaytlin said she confronted the girl who pushed her sister on social media, looking for an apology. She pretty much said that she was sorry for doing it and she wouldn\u0027t have done it if she knew the outcome of it and that she knows it was an absurd thing to do, Kaytlin said. I think the girl that pushed her should have some sort of consequence because you wont learn your lesson if you think you can could do that again and think it will be fine. As Jordan fell, her arms and legs kick helplessly in a panic as she fell to the water below. The footage was taken on Tuesday and posted on YouTube by Ashley Mahree who described the act as \u0027almost criminal\u0027.

She told the Irish Mirror : “At 7.30pm I said I was going to bed and then at 1am I woke up and I was blind.

She added: “The staff were very good. They had to put a bleach in my eye and they told me to count to 10 the pain was so severe. They said, ‘Okay we’ve managed to deaden the nerves and clean them so we’ll be able to save the eye, but we’ll just have to keep you here’. So I was on morphine, the lot. The pain was like a searing hot knife through my eye.” “They were going to take the eye out. They were saying this is the Acanthamoeba virus and it has to go.” Explaining what happened to her, Suzanne said her consultant told her she “basically had a shower and there’s parasites in the water because the weather has been so warm.

British UN envoy Mark Griffith, speaking in the wake of dozens of civilians being killed in a bus blast, warned of “massive humanitarian suffering” if the bloodshed continues.  He said: “A failed state in Yemen has extraordinary consequences for the region, and the wider region, and beyond. And it’s not that inconceivable that could happen. We have to act now. “We also need to act now because in my judgment the war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. “There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even than it is now.”  He added: “My worry about Yemen is that if we left it and it wasn’t resolved, we could look at Syria-plus in the years to come.” The bodies of about 40 children were among scores killed in an airstrike in Saada province, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. The UK Government faces calls to cease selling arms and providing military advice to Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition that carried out the strike. Iran is supporting Houthi rebels who are being hammered from the air by the Saudi-led coalition in one of the Middle East’s most brutal proxy wars in decades. According to the UN the youngsters had been at a summer camp when the bus was struck on Thursday, with most of the dead between 10 and 13 years old.

He’s got the character to brush this off and against Aberdeen on Saturday, he’ll have no qualms going back in there and making saves.“Fans can be very fickle and obviously as a keeper mistakes are highlighted because they cost goals but Jack has the ability to go and be a hero this week.“In pre-season he obviously did something right to convince Neil McCann to put him in and take over from Elliott Parish.“Neil took Jack into the club to play and one mistake isn’t going to change that.“Over the course of the season I have no doubt he’ll save more points for Dundee than he’ll cost them.”Soutar admits Hamilton is suffering the “life of a goalie” at the moment, a position where an error more often than not leads to conceding a goal.However, as a Dundee fan himself, Soutar is backing the Dens faithful to get behind their new keeper this weekend and manager Neil McCann to stick with Hamilton between the posts.“Everybody makes mistakes and there will be some supporters who will be on your back from the first minute but as a goalkeeper you just have to go back in and make saves for your team,” he added.“Dundee fans, though, always forgive – it’s a speciality of the Dee support.“He lost the ball and lost a goal but if he goes and megs a boy on Saturday everybody will love him!“I think the manager will stick with him – it highlights the error more if he makes a switch.“Neil had obviously seen enough in Jack to start him this season and I think he should stick by that decision, at least for the first few games.“I had a terrible week myself at Dunfermline when Jim Duffy was manager at Dens – he could’ve dropped me but he stuck by me and I ended up being Man of the Match against Motherwell the next week.“The worst thing for Jack would be to drop him – let him get it out of his system and go play.“It’s the life of a goalie – everyone forgets the good stuff when you make a mistake.”Getting used to a new way of playing takes every player a bit of time to adjust – with the league campaign already under way, however, Soutar admits Hamilton will need to get used to playing out from the back quickly.“At Hearts over the last few years, the team has been a more physical side rather than the footballing team Dundee like to be.“Jack has to adapt to that very quickly, though. The manager likes to play out from the back and he’ll have to get used to it.“Sometimes, though, as a goalie when you’re under pressure, you just have to stick it in row Z and deal with the flak afterwards.“Jack will learn from it, though.“It’s still early days for him. It’s only one game and I’d back him to put in a performance on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/5981c5392158b.jpg ","title":"scottish government recruits 93 folk from 1367 applicants to work at new benefits hq in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish Government has recruited 93 people in Dundee to work at the country’s new social security headquarters.Competition was fierce, with 1,367 applications made within a few weeks of the client service advisers’ roles being advertised, according to official figures.The city’s jobs boost is the first wave of appointments for the agency, which is initially operating from the council’s base on North Lindsay Street.The advisers will be processing applications and responding to queries.The starting salary was advertised as £17,641.The agency is expected to be fully operational by 2021 with 1,900 jobs spread across the country, 750 of which will be in Dundee.It’s expected 80 posts will be filled in this recruitment round, but the number of people appointed is higher because of working practices such as job sharing.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b6d5a753ec2b.jpg ","title":"sculptor has designs on community art spaces","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee artist and sculptor has ambitious plans to create a community garden in the Linlathen area of the city to display his work and that of others.Joe Alcorn, 67, also hopes to develop community art spaces all over the city.He is currently in talks with Lidl about having a piece of his work on show at the new retail development site planned for Kingsway East.Joe creates amazing works of art and sculptures at his home in the city’s Fountainbleau Road.His small back garden plays host to an incredible display of his sculptures created over the past 15 years.He said each sculpture takes about three months to complete and they are carved out of sandstone and granite.He said: “I am now retired and can spend all my days in my workshop in the garden.“I work with recycled stone as much as possible and also take inspiration from the piece of stone I have to work with.”He has recently created a series of sculptures based on Pictish art.Joe has high hopes they will be the pieces that kick off the community garden.“I have studied a lot about Pictish art and have created a whole series of sculptures which are based on my interpretation of their work,” he said.“I would love to create a community garden at the pavilion in Fountainbleau Road to encourage other people to come along and get involved and learn to enjoy art.“These are life-size pieces that I would love to see in such a garden.“However, my plans for the garden are not just for my sculptures.“I would like other artists to contribute as well and create a space for everyone in Dundee to enjoy.“If that is successful I would also love to see community art spaces all over the city.”Among the Pictish pieces is one inspired by river deities.Joe said: “I have named my piece Tay.“It would be a fantastic piece to have somewhere down at the new Waterfront.“I have also had initial talks with Dundee City Council about possibly getting some of the pieces displayed around the Waterfront, maybe even at Slessor Gardens.“I want to open up art to people all over the city and encourage others to get involved.“I would be making my pieces available free of charge.“If any do sell then the money would be ploughed back into my Art Social group to get people taking part in creating art.“We need to give art back to the community.“I do a lot of work through the group because I believe society needs to be included in the creative activity, and everyone can understand art at a basic level.

The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03211000/03211069.jpg","title":"Dozens apply for top job at council","story":"\u0026nbspTHERE has been a rush for the vacant \u0026pound147,989 position of chief executive at Highland Council.A total of 28 people have applied for the job and a council source has hinted two of the applicants are council employees.Steve Barron will step down from the top job in the autumn after five years in the post.The council\u0027 press office refused to give any details about the process, saying recruitment matters were \"confidential\".A spokeswoman added: \"On appointment of a new chief executive, the council will announce the appointment\".The figure of 28 was, however, verified by Glasgow-based executive recruitment agency Aspen People.As part of the process, a cross-party panel of 25 councillors and trade union representatives will meet the job candidates on September 13 at Eden Court Theatre, after which a shortlist will be compiled.Each candidate will have 15 minutes to introduce themselves and answer questions at the theatre gathering.One councillor described it as \"a sort of speed dating\" event.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116949.jpg","title":"Friends join 103 year old on her big day","story":"\u0026nbspTHE oldest woman in an Inverness care home celebrated her \"big day\" in style with a surprise party.Inverness-woman Muriel Lees turned 103 years old in Kingsmills Care Home on Monday.She was surrounded by her seven closest friends and care home staff for a special cake and rendition of the Happy Birthday song.Home manager, Carmen Delostrino and her staff decked out a room in the home with banners and balloons and would be hosting a lunch to celebrate.\"She likes her own space and getting her hair done every Thursday,\" she said.\"Muriel is a really nice lady and knows all of the staff by name, we have all been excited to surprise her because she appreciates everything so much and is just so lovely to everyone.\"She added: \"She has been talking about her \u0026lsquobig day\u0026rsquo for a while and was looking forward to getting dressed up and spending it with her friends but she had no idea that she would be surprised by her other friends too.\"It feels like an achievement for us that she is so happy at 103 years old!\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116948.jpg","title":"Outlander landmark needs 100k investment","story":"\u0026nbspA HISTORIC landmark which is experiencing a dramatic rise in visitor numbers is in need of long overdue repairs and proper interpretation estimated to be about \u0026pound100,000.Wardlaw Mausoleum in Kirkhill \u0026ndash resting place of various Lovat Fraser family members \u0026ndash is becoming a must-stop location for fans of the historical time travel Outlander book and TV series.The A-listed building has also in the spotlight in recent months after forensic experts carried out tests on remains contained in a coffin in the crypt. Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things.

He is also in contention to start this afternoon against Dundee at Dens Park.The former Wigan man had a strong finish to last season, starting in the Reds’ last four post-split fixtures.He admits that at this early stage in his Aberdeen career he did not expect to play quite so much. Cosgrove feels he is improving with every game but reckons the Red Army have yet to see his best form – and he is keen to show it in the weeks ahead.He said: “The game time I’ve been getting is absolutely invaluable to me for my performance and development.“It’s exactly what I want to be doing and the calibre of games we’ve been playing in will be nothing but good for me personally.“I think it would be naive to say I expected to play as much as I have but I definitely knew that I could it’s early in my time here but there’s no point in just plodding along and getting the odd game.“I wanted to come here and really stamp my authority and I think I have done. It’s just getting to that next level – whether that’s goals, assists or high-quality performances, I feel I need to kick on.“I do feel there is more to come because I’m learning every game and getting better. The things you learn aren’t always obvious but there’s little things you pick up in games, like where to buy fouls and places to get free from defenders. Everything is adding up but I am still learning.“It does always play (not scoring) on your mind because as a striker it’s my main job, to score. But there’s a lot of work that goes under the radar, like working off the ball and holding up play and things that are vital for the team.“It’s the final piece, whether it’s an assist or a goal, that does get noticed and I’m just trying as hard as I can to do it all. I’m hoping the goals will come and once I get the first one, I’m hoping I can get more.”Cosgrove is also looking forward to savouring the moment of netting his first competitive goal for the Dons. He added: “It will be massive for me because it’s my job to score. Part of it will feel normal, but getting your first goal for a club is always special.”Ahead of today’s game against Dundee, Cosgrove says the Dons have a point to prove after what he feels was a below-par performance in the 1-1 draw with 10-man Rangers on Sunday.He said: “We’re disappointed with the performance on Sunday. But we’ve come away with a point and it does feel like a good point given the circumstances. Last week was the weeks we want to be playing in. We had a tough game down at Turf Moor against Burnley and then there was no better game than Rangers to come back to at Pittodrie.“As tough as it was, we were massively looking forward to it and they are the games we want to be playing week in and week out.“Now, though, the main focus is on Dundee and we’re looking forward to getting going again because we’ve got a point to prove, performance-wise.“We’ve had a good week’s training, we’re feeling and looking sharp so hopefully we can take that into the game. There’s been excuses about tiredness on Sunday but, as a team and a club, the performance wasn’t up to standard at all.“The Rangers game was massively disappointing but the belief is still there within the squad that there’s a lot more to come. Everyone has blips but we’ll bounce back and get the performances we need.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/SKIPPY-SKATEBOARD-940x362.jpg ","title":"win skippy peanut butter skateboard with helmet and pads","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne lucky winner will get their hands on one of these cool, branded skateboards with a safety helmet and pads thrown in PLUS two jars of SKIPPY® Peanut Butter and a branded silicone spatula with the whole prize worth £200.Five runners-up can win two jars of SKIPPY® Peanut Butter plus a branded silicone spatula.All you need to do to be in with a chance of winning is fill in this form below.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens techfest celebrates 25th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA science and technology festival which has inspired hundreds of thousands of youngsters for 25 years is poised to return to Aberdeen.TechFest aims to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.Along with interactive workshops, shows and presentations, people will get a chance to hear from former Olympic curler Jackie Lockhart.She will share stories from her career alongside manager of Curl Aberdeen and fellow champion curler Tom Brewster, who will provide technical insight into how the maintenance of ice can affect the outcome of a match.As part of its milestone year, in addition to a range of science topics on offer, there will also be a variety of events exploring the history and uses of silver.National Museums Scotland will also present key objects from its touring exhibition, with Behind The Scenes of Scotland’s Early Silver: From Conservation to Display on September 12.Sarah Chew, managing director of TechFest, said: “This is a really exciting year for TechFest as we celebrate 25 years of the festival and we are pleased to unveil such a diverse and fun-filled programme for our anniversary.“Over the years you can imagine how the event has changed.“If you look at the programme in 2001, we were following the possibility of water on Mars pretty closely.“And in that area, there has been massive discoveries and now we see in 2018 that life on Mars is much closer than we realised at the time.“There’s the story of a woman who is now a nursery manager and used to come to TechFest as a kid – and now she’s one of our presenters who helps us to be on the cutting edge.”Sarah added: “Once again we have some of the brightest minds and biggest personalities in the Stem sphere presenting, as well as musicians and sporting personalities who can demonstrate how Stem plays a role in their disciplines too.“A lot has changed since we first launched as a charity in 1995.“However, our ethos of inspiring, educating and entertaining people of all ages has remained the same and we can’t wait to welcome everyone.

These included a small play area, a communal seating area and raised beds in which vegetables could be grown.The Seaton Backies committee, Aberdeen City Council communities team and other partners met after the most recent consultation event in May, and it was decided that a play park would be reintroduced.Plans are now being tendered for installing the equipment.Councillor Ross Grant, who represents the Tillydrone, Seaton and Old Aberdeen ward, said: “This step is a significant one for the project and for the community as a whole. It’s a great step forward.“Before the Seaton Backies project began, it was a very unwelcoming space for people who wanted to use it.“The project is a great example of community vision and of a quality partnership between the administration and its constituents.”The Seaton Backies project was started by a group of mums, who wanted to make a difference in their neighbourhood and to ignite community spirit, while ensuring their children could have a safe place to play.The communal plot of land lay in the shadow of Seaton’s high-rise flats and was not viewed as a welcoming environment for use by families.Since launching, the committee has already had several spaces revamped and turned into new play areas.As well as the park, there are two new large spaces across two sites at the Backies that require further development.Councillors unanimously agreed to demolish more wash houses last year, which was expected to cost around £102,000.The Seaton communities team has appealed for as many residents as possible to take part in the scheme so they can get a more complete picture of what people would like.Anyone who wants to get involved, or would like to help make a difference in the Seaton area, is asked to contact Graham Donald, community development worker at Aberdeen City Council, on 01224 277928.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"city road to close","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA city road is to close for four days for resurfacing work to be carried out.Eday Road in Aberdeen will be shut between its junction with Rousay Drive to 10 miles east of its junction with Eday Walk, and from this point to the boundary between numbers 82 and 84 on the street from 6.30pm on August 27 until 10pm on August 31.The closures will be in place to protect public safety during carriageway resurfacing works.Access to properties will be maintained but no through traffic will be allowed to travel down the road.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"closures of roads for show","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA series of road closures will take place in a north-east town this weekend.Tarland Show, held annually in the Deeside village near Aboyne, will require a number of routes to be closed.Activities at this year’s event include a mountain bike race and truck show, with vintage and modern tractors competing.There is also afternoon entertainment on offer for all ages.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr railway line faces overnight","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel faces urgent overnight repairs as safety teams move inCouncil officials have confirmed they will move in from 10pm tomorrow (Saturday) and work through the night as part of repairs that could last days.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson19:34, 10 AUG 2018Updated20:26, 10 AUG 2018NewsAyr railway station (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSafety teams are to carry out urgent overnight repairs on Ayr\u0027s Station Hotel, it can be revealed. Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety. The hotel\u0027s current owners, based in Malaysia, have so far failed to act on a Dangerous Building Notice served on the hotel in the Spring.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

volunteers are leading the tours, which begin at 10.30am and do not need to be booked, with those wishing to take part meeting at the cinema\u0026#8217s front desk.A Courier reporter joined 14 people of all ages \u0026#8211 and a dog \u0026#8211 on Tuesday\u0026#8217s tour, led by Geraldine Davey, and learned a few new things.The tour began by heading back outside to look at the exterior of the building, which was designed by Glasgow School of Art alumni and architect Albert Victor Gardner, at its original entrance.The tour continued into the cinema\u0026#8217s screen one, with its iconic two \u0026#8216wee hooses\u0026#8217 either side of the stage, one of which used to be a broom cupboard and the other allegedly the manager\u0026#8217s office.It was revealed that in 1960 it cost 3s to sit on the balcony and 1s 6d to sit in the stalls.People said that it was actually quite expensive at the time, with one commenting: \u0026#8216It cost a lot of pocket money to come to the cinema.\u0026#8217A few people tested the comfort of some of the 193 seats from French firm Quinette Gallay, with one gentleman who was reluctant to get up again commenting: \u0026#8216Just give me a shout when you\u0026#8217re leaving.\u0026#8217The tour continued upstairs to the balcony, where Mrs Davey pointed out the clouds painted on the roof, fitting in with the cinema\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216atmospheric\u0026#8217 status.\u0026#8216This is supposedly the closest we can get to the original,\u0026#8217 she said.She said that the cinema, once nicknamed the \u0026#8216flea pit\u0026#8217 due to its inferior stature compared to the Rex cinema, employed a pianist, Adam Ritchie Greig, when it first opened in 1913 to accompany the silent films.When \u0026#8216talkies\u0026#8217 started to become popular and his playing was no longer required, Mr Greig founded an orchestra which proved very popular for social events and functions.The tour continued into the new, second screen, which has 52 seats, with many comments on its intimate setting.The cinema operated continuously from when it first opened its doors until it closed in 2014, for three years, for £3.5 million of renovations.To find out even more take the next tours, on Tuesday August 14 and Thursday August 16, at 10.30am.Geraldine Davey, in the centre of the balcony of screen one, led her first tour of the cinema this week. 50_c32cinematours02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"carni west to capture campbeltowns mokfest spirit","story":"This year, MOKFest favourite, the Festival

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

National 5 pass rates at an A-C grade fell from 78.5 per cent to 75.4 per cent however, the local authority said that this was affected by the removal of monthly assessments which made up a percentage of the final mark.  The percentage of young people achieving Grade A awards in English and mathematics at Higher level is also at its highest rate in five years.  In maths 37 per cent of pupils received the top grade, while in English 31 per cent did \u0026ndash both going up by four per cent on last year.  The percentage of S6 pupils gaining one or more Advanced Highers increased by 1.5 per cent in 2018 to 22.1 per cent and showed an overall improved trend in East Lothian since 2014.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council head of education, said: \u0026ldquoThese results provide a clear indication of an improving trend across our secondary schools.  \u0026ldquoIt is testament to the hard work of the students and teachers that this year has resulted in the highest level of achievement in five years. I would like to add my congratulations to all students who have received results.  Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoCongratulations to all our young people on the success they have achieved in their SQA results. Our schools have improved their performance in SQA Higher Courses, with the pass rate at their highest in five years. And pass rates at grade A in Higher maths and English also at their highest level in five years.  \u0026ldquoThese are great results for our young people and they will really help to set them up for the next phase of their journeys. For this effort I would like to thank all our teachers for their hard work and to all our parents and carers for their continued support."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8185960.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"lack-of-consultation-over-prestonpans-library-change-is-criticised","story":"  East Lothian Council plans to move the majority of its services from its Aldhammer House offices in Prestonpans into the town\u0026rsquos library.  The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8187733.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"nursery-is-praised-by-inspectors","story":"  A team visited Mary Poppins Nursery in June and met with parents as well as staff.

The ruling, due out this week, said that Amazon has been told to \u0026ldquomake clear that some Prime labelled items were not available to be delivered by the next day, adding: \u0026ldquoThe ad must not appear again in its current form.  Explaining why they concluded the ad was \u0026ldquomisleading, the ASA said in its ruling: \u0026ldquoBecause consumers were likely to understand that, so long as they did not order too late or for Sunday delivery, all Prime labelled items would be available for delivery the next day with the One Day Delivery option, when a significant proportion of Prime labelled items were not available for delivery by the subsequent day with One Day Delivery, we concluded that the ad was misleading.

The ads, seen in July 2017 for a television, gaming monitor, laptop and electric toothbrush, all listed RRPs and savings of up to \u0026pound300.  Each ad received a single complaint that the savings were misleading and unsubstantiated.  The ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form, adding: \u0026ldquoWe told Amazon to ensure that future references to RRPs reflected the price at which the products concerned were generally sold, and to ensure that they held adequate evidence to substantiate their savings claims."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7842387.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"luchy-lopez-hammann-east-kilbride-hairmyres","story":"  Luchy Lopez-Hammann, 52, from Hamburg, Germany, was just an hour and a half away when her husband, Andreas Hammann, who suffered a heart attack on Saturday, died.

Ms Aitken added: \u0026ldquoThe atmosphere in Glasgow during the championships has been tremendous and the welcome that people all over the city have given to athletes and visitors alike has been typically friendly and enthusiastic.  \u0026ldquoAlthough it comes as absolutely no surprise, I couldn\u0026rsquot be more proud of the way the city has embraced our friends and neighbours from across Europe.  The comments come as Team Great Britain had one of its most successful days in the games yesterday, bringing home 10 medals.  Diver Jack Laugher received his second gold of the games for the 3m springboard competition, swimmer Ben Proud came first in the 50m freestyle and teammates Adam Peaty, Nicholas Pyle, James Guy and Duncan Scott worked together to nab the top prize in the men\u0026rsquos 4x100m medley relay.  Jess Learmonth got silver in the women\u0026rsquos triathlon, Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams came second in the synchronised 10m diving while swimmers Max Litchfield and Imogen Clark also gained silver in the 400m individual medley and the 50m breaststroke respectively.

As the athletes continue to shine on the global stage, their success has prompted sportscotland to confirm the first recipients of a \u0026pound500,000 legacy fund aimed at getting communities across the country more active.  More than 90 projects will share around \u0026pound250,000 as part of GO LIVE! GET ACTIVE, a programme designed to support Community Sport Hubs (CSHs) deliver a sporting legacy from the first ever multi-sport European Championships.  The Scottish Government funding, which is being invested by sportscotland, is supporting CSHs that establish new sport or physical activity sessions to target those most inactive in communities. It is also being used to fund projects that use sport and physical activity to improve health, wellbeing and social cohesion.  Minister for sport, Joe FitzPatrick, marked the funding awards by visiting Whitacres Community Sport Hub in Glasgow, which will receive \u0026pound4,590 to deliver a series of new boxing sessions for 16 to 25-year-old women and men over the age of 40.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis \u0026pound500,000 investment will build on the enthusiasm generated by Glasgow 2018, making a lasting difference in communities throughout the country, with a positive impact on the health of individuals while boosting community cohesion.  \u0026ldquoWhitacres Community Sport Hub is a perfect example of this. In particular, I\u0026rsquove been impressed by their boxing programme, which has achieved great success with women and older people.  Meanwhile, the games are also encouraging the city to take interest in an entirely new sport \u0026ndash golf.  As the only new event in the programme at Glasgow 2018, the historic event at Gleneagles is proving popular with fans, and those who can\u0026rsquot make it along in person are gathering in George Square and Glasgow Green to watch the action unfold.

Looking out, he would have seen Ben Tianavaig and, beyond, Raasay. What he could not have seen, nor imagined, was a future in which Runrig, the band for which he had just started to sing, would become the biggest in Scotland and have a lasting impact on Scottish culture. But the ingredients of that success were all around. Malcolm Jones \u0026ndash later the guitarist, but then still at school \u0026ndash lived down the street. The brothers Rory and Calum Macdonald, Runrig\u0026rsquos songwriting partnership, were on Fraser Crescent, around the corner so close that on summer nights, windows open to the island air, they could hear the fledgling rock star singing into the bathroom mirror, giving Elvis laldy.  \u0026ldquoThere was a dance every night in different villages around the island, Munro recalls. \u0026ldquoWe were playing five, six nights a week. Those drouthy whisky evenings at the Skye Gathering Hall, the Portree British Legion, Kyleakin Badminton Club were Runrig\u0026rsquos equivalent of the Beatles in Hamburg playing Proud Mary and Gay Gordons, learning their trade, earning their stripes. Never on a Sunday, of course the peace of the Sabbath was observed, a policy Runrig have maintained throughout a 45-year career which, soon now, will come to an end.  If Donnie Munro is in nostalgic mood, it is to a purpose. Having left Runrig in 1997 (to be replaced by the Canadian singer Bruce Guthro) he will be reunited with the band at the Last Dance, two farewell concerts in Stirling in August, in front of 45,000 fans. \u0026ldquoRunrig is a hard thing to let go, Calum Macdonald had told me when we met at his home in the Highlands. \u0026ldquoIt has been our life\u0026rsquos work, so there\u0026rsquos an emotional attachment. It was a difficult decision, but deep within us we know it is the right one. Let\u0026rsquos have a clean end and be positive about it. Bring the ship home to a safe harbour.  Driving around Scotland, meeting Runrig members past and present, there is time to listen deeply to their body of work, from 1978\u0026rsquos Play Gaelic through their 1987 smash The Cutter And The Clan (at the time, the fastest-selling LP ever released in Scotland) to their elegiac final album The Story. Their catalogue is sophisticated, complex, engaged with people, place, identity, faith. Little wonder their frustration at being pigeonholed as kitschy professional Scots. \u0026ldquoOur records still get put in the racks with the Scottish dance bands and pipe bands rather than between Run-DMC and the Rolling Stones where they should be, Calum sighed. \u0026ldquoThe national thing, it overwhelms you.  Here is a band whose contribution to Scottish culture has been immense, even historic. Their true place is among a lineage that stretches through Robert Burns, Billy Connolly and the historian John Prebble their internationally popular stories of Scotland and Scottishness have, arguably, had a shaping influence on the way we see ourselves and are seen by the world. In particular, as the first band to fuse the Gaelic language with rock, they remade an ancient tradition for a new age.  \u0026ldquoThey changed the face of music with their compositions in Gaelic, says Julie Fowlis. The 39-year-old singer-songwriter grew up with Runrig, as did many Hebrideans of her generation as a schoolgirl in North Uist, in 1990, she appeared in a video for the song Siol Ghoraidh. \u0026ldquoTheirs was an entirely new voice. It was brave and bold and from the heart. They took the language with them and kept it with them on their journey. We owe them a lot.  An old accordion. An older photograph. If the story of Runrig could be told in two objects, it would be these. Each has a totemic power.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a defining image of where I came from. A very peasant-looking photo, Calum Macdonald explained. \u0026ldquoI found it in a drawer in our house in Skye. It\u0026rsquos my grandmother and her friends round about. Black and white, torn in one corner, the picture shows a group of islanders stooking corn in the 1930s. He found it in 1975, in his early twenties, and it became a \u0026ldquopersonal talisman, inspiring the sort of songs he would go on to write rooted in the land, the language, personal and cultural history.  The Uist novelist Angus Peter Campbell has described the impact on the Hebrides of Runrig\u0026rsquos success: \u0026ldquoBy becoming international stars they have made the local universal and continue to give dignity to a scorned people and a scorned culture.  Is that how Calum saw it? That when they were on stage, or in the studio, they were representing not only themselves, but their folk? \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely. We were very aware of carrying that with us, and proud to do it.  Wasn\u0026rsquot it a burden? \u0026ldquoNo, an absolute privilege. But it was crucial that we weren\u0026rsquot doing it as a pressure group, or a political movement in any way, because that would weaken it. It had to be done naturally.  Rory Macdonald is 69, his brother\u0026rsquos senior by almost five years. Calum is Runrig\u0026rsquos chief lyricist, Rory, who plays bass, is the driving musical force. We spoke at his home on the Dornoch Firth before taking a turn on the sand. He seemed in good humour, even when asked about Loch Lomond. The band\u0026rsquos best known song, it has likely contributed a great deal to the perception of Runrig as couthy and sentimental. But no, he said, there were no regrets about covering it. \u0026ldquoExcept at weddings, quite often it\u0026rsquos the last song of the night. That\u0026rsquos my cue to go to the toilet. It\u0026rsquos not cool to dance to your own record.  Talk turned to his late father. Donald John Macdonald had served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders during the Second World War, later joining the police, before becoming a social worker. One of Runrig\u0026rsquos most beautiful songs, An Ubhal as \u0026Agraveirde, is about him. It became the first Gaelic song to make it into the UK top 20.  \u0026ldquoHe was a gregarious character, the life and soul, but like most of his generation he tried to shield what he\u0026rsquod experienced during the war, Rory said. \"There was pain. He saw his friend killed. He was standing in the turret of the tank, and thought he\u0026rsquod been shot because he was suddenly covered in blood. But it wasn\u0026rsquot his. His best pal died beside him.  This was Sandy MacIntyre. The tank crew had been ambushed in Normandy. Donald John, a sergeant, wrote to his friend\u0026rsquos parents to inform them of their loss, and kept in touch.  \u0026ldquoI remember going with my dad to visit Sandy\u0026rsquos folks in Greenock, when I was about nine, Rory recalled. \u0026ldquoThey were obviously poor, and just really nice people. A little kitchen-living room all the washing hanging off a pulley. Just as we were leaving, his mum said, \u0026lsquoWell, Sandy\u0026rsquos accordion\u0026rsquos still here, and we\u0026rsquod like to give it to your boy.\u0026rsquo They brought it down, in a black case, and gave it to me.  A beautful blue Hohner, here was a treasure and a passed torch. Keys that should have been pressed by their son, and perhaps his child in turn, would yield music under the fingers of Rory instead. Later, he would play it on the anti-war song The Everlasting Gun, but its greater significance is that it was his first instrument, setting him down the path to Runrig.  \u0026ldquoThat was massive, he nodded. \u0026ldquoOne of those moments in life that are key and that you always remember. I was aware not just of getting the accordion, but the love and kindness behind that.  Blood, then, watered the roots of Runrig. Blood spilled in France, blood passed between generations in the Hebrides. A sense of the tragic and a sense of tradition, both at the heart of the band\u0026rsquos music, symbolised by that family photograph found in a drawer, that instrument which found a new life.  Runrig\u0026rsquos pretty melodies sometimes come spiked with venom. The Everlasting Gun is one hell of an angry song. Perhaps because of the language barrier, it is little understood how important an emotion anger is in the band\u0026rsquos work. They are seen by many as soft-focus, shortbread-tin all kilt, no dirk. Listen, though, to Tir An Airm (a protest song against military bases) or Dance Called America (a rage against the Highland Clearances) or especially Fichead Bliadhna, which expresses Calum Macdonald\u0026rsquos frustration that he and his generation were taught nothing at school of the Clearances and other traumas of Gaeldom.  Although they have a politics, the band has, generally, avoided making statements of support for any one party. Internally, though, there has been discussion. \u0026ldquoFor most rock bands, it was sex, drugs and rock \u0026rsquon\u0026rsquo roll at the back of the tour bus, but Runrig were too busy debating Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional question, said Pete Wishart, the band\u0026rsquos keyboard player from 1986 and 2001.  In common with the rest of the band, Wishart came from a Labour-supporting background, but his immersion in Runrig made him better understand and sympathise with issues, such as land ownership, which were part of the devolution agenda. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not saying I\u0026rsquom a nationalist, and I probably never will join the SNP, was his view in a 1991 interview. He is now the SNP MP for Perth and North Perthshire.  His political journey, he feels, is typical of Runrig\u0026rsquos influence on Scotland: a hugely popular band which seemed to foreground and explore Scottish identity, they were part of a wave of cultural nationalism which, quite without intent, seeded the ground for political nationalism.  \u0026ldquoI always felt that Runrig were the soundtrack to the emerging of the Scottish Parliament, Wishart told me. \u0026ldquoOur song Alba is essentially about that. It was no longer unfashionable to raise issues to do with the Gaelic culture or language. Scotland was learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. All the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  Tensions within the group arose not as a result of differences in ideology, but rather over the question of whether band members should be open about their party allegiances. Rory, in particular, was appalled by Donnie Munro\u0026rsquos decision, in the early 1990s, to declare his support for Labour: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot want the music to be tainted by propaganda, or for a political party to be feeding off the name of the band. That hurt a wee bit.  Munro\u0026rsquos decision to leave the band hit Rory hard. \u0026ldquoI was devastated. It was almost like the break-up of a love affair, and for quite a while after that there was a frostiness. That\u0026rsquos human nature. But we\u0026rsquore grand now.  A long audition process was required to find a replacement: Bruce Guthro, a singer-songwriter from Nova Scotia. \u0026ldquoThe moment we heard him singing it felt right, Calum explained. \u0026ldquoBut he also came with a story. Emigration to Canada \u0026ndash that sense of exile and homesick yearning \u0026ndash had long been a Runrig theme. \u0026ldquoSo it was like we were taking something back from the diaspora. That was exciting.  It has become an accepted narrative that Munro left the band for politics, standing in the 1997 general election for the seat of Ross, Skye and Inverness West, and losing to Charles Kennedy. When we meet, he explains that it wasn\u0026rsquot quite that simple. He also missed his wife and children while on tour, and wondered how much more, creatively, he had to offer. \u0026ldquoBut I think, though I ceased to perform with Runrig, in my head I never really really left the band. I\u0026rsquove never been able nor wanted to separate myself from what we did collectively.  Munro is director of development, fundraising and the arts at Sabhal M\u0026ograver Ostaig, the Gaelic college on Skye it was established in 1973, the same year as Runrig, and Munro sees his work as an extension of what the band was doing \u0026ndash expressing ideas, being part of the regeneration of culture and community. At the farewell concerts, he will perform a couple of songs with the band, but will also open the show with a set which will include Runrig material.  \u0026ldquoI would have felt very disconnected not to have participated in the last shows, he says. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos such a momentous thing for all us in lots of ways. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity to celebrate the connection with this audience. For many people, it\u0026rsquos not just a concert, it\u0026rsquos a piece of their personal history.  Lea Andrews will be there in Stirling, on the final night. How could she not be? For the 32 year old fan from Gateshead, the Last Dance is a last chance to express through her presence gratitude for what the band has meant all these years. Her parents split up when she was two her father had custody, but she wanted to live with her mother. Her stepfather and mother became fans of Runrig after seeing them live in Portree, and introduced the little girl to their music.  \u0026ldquoBecause I was pining after me mam so much, their music became synonymous with the feeling I had when I was with her, Lea recalls. She saw her mother every second weekend between times, on a Walkman, she would listen to Runrig. Every River, City of Lights, Always The Winner \u0026ndash these songs became both the soundtrack to separation, and lullabies containing the promise of reunion. \u0026ldquoThe sound of Donnie\u0026rsquos voice gave me such huge comfort, and that comfort has lasted throughout my life.  Could it have been any band that made Lea, as a child, feel soothed and understood? Was it just a fluke that it turned out to be Runrig? Arguably not. The music of Calum and Rory Macdonald, which so often touches on ideas of homesickness and homecoming, emerges from their childhood experience of separation.  \u0026ldquoA significant moment in our lives was when we left Uist and flitted to Skye, Rory recalled. He was 12 years old that summer, his brother seven. Their father had a new job on the much larger island. \u0026ldquoMy dad hired a small cargo boat from Scalpay. At about seven o\u0026rsquo clock that evening, we were all set to leave, and most of the village came down to see us off. As the boat was pulling away, all these people were on the pier waving to us. That experience is ingrained in Calum and I, and it has triggered a lot of songs.  Rory seemed moved by the recollection. When you close your eyes, I asked, can you see it? \u0026ldquoI can see it and feel it. It was visceral, hugely emotional. It gets you in the gut.  For people who don\u0026rsquot come from that island culture, this strength of feeling might be difficult to understand. After all, it\u0026rsquos not as if the family was leaving for a new life in America yet the Minch can be an Atlantic of the mind. \u0026ldquoYou were leaving a community that had enveloped you, Rory explained. \u0026ldquoOne where you knew everybody. You were aware of the love that was being imparted by these people coming down to the pier. All your friends. It was just overwhelming.  Would it be reasonable to suggest that the Macdonald brothers\u0026rsquo later empathy for those forced from their homes during the Clearances, and their ability to articulate that pain in song, goes back to this early experience of being uprooted? \u0026ldquoYes, we could identify with all that. It was a very intense experience.  In his foreword to Flower Of The West: The Runrig Songbook, the poet Aonghas MacNeacail notes that the Macdonalds grew up under the influence of two elemental landscapes: sea-scaped Uist and mountainous Skye the former, it could be argued, gives their music its melancholy, the latter its grandeur. Other early influences included the left-wing radicalism of the West Highland Free Press, the newspaper founded in Skye the year before Runrig formed, and the psalm-singing of the Free Presbyterian Church in which the Macdonalds were raised. One might also mention a gentleman known as Willie the Barber, whose shop by the pier in Portree doubled as the village\u0026rsquos record store as the 1960s worn on, the nascent rockers of Skye, chary of scissors, became more likely to visit the barber for the ecstatic records they were hearing on Radio Luxembourg. When Rory Macdonald heard Procul Harum\u0026rsquos Whiter Shade Of Pale for the first time, he rose from the family dinner table and went up, weeping, to his room.  The sea, the psalms, and socialism hard rock and soft island skies \u0026ndash all of these are part of Runrig, and Runrig is, forevermore, part of Scotland\u0026rsquos story. Only the Stirling concerts remain. On that final night, as they play each song, they will know it is for the last time. Alba no more. Skye no more. Loch Lomond no more.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be hard, Rory said. \u0026ldquoI do just occasionally think, \u0026lsquoAre we doing the right thing?\u0026rsquo But no, I\u0026rsquom at peace with it. I hope the concerts will be celebratory. Maybe, at the end, a few tears will be shed \u0026hellip  Runrig: The Last Dance will be at City Park, Stirling, on August 17 \u0026amp 18"},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-inquiry-into-jobs-for-the-boys-university-principal-appointment","story":"  The move by the UCU Scotland lecturers union comes after Professor John Harper was made principal of Robert Gordon University, in Aberdeen.  Mr Harper was appointed after the former principal unexpectedly stepped down following a conflict of interest row.  In a letter to Mike Cantlay, chair of the Scottish Funding Council, the UCU said the appointment breached the code of good governance for Scottish higher education.  The letter, from Mary Senior, the union\u0026rsquos Scotland official, said: \u0026ldquoI want to raise with you our deep concerns about the apparent lack of any open appointment process.  \u0026ldquoWe are concerned that this seemingly overnight elevation of one of the  vice principals to the position on a permanent basis does not sit well with good governance nor with equal opportunities principles.  \u0026ldquoWe want to be proud of our universities, but misguided decisions like this one damage that reputation and do nothing to give staff and students confidence in those leading our institutions. We would ask for your views and intervention on this matter.  The Scottish Code of Good Higher Education Governance states that  governing bodies are expected to ensure that the appointment process for principals \u0026ldquoenables student, staff and trade union input to be taken into account.  Ms Senior said she was not aware of an open appointment process having been conducted with student, staff or trade union input.  And she said the importance of following the correct procedure was to introduce greater diversity into senior university management - which is dominated by white males.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe cannot see how automatically promoting one white male vice-principal, is open, transparent or fair in any sense.  \u0026ldquoIt denies a whole range of other individuals \u0026ndash women and men \u0026ndash the opportunity to apply for this highly paid, important leadership role.  However, Mike Fleming, chair of the university\u0026rsquos board of governors, denied there had been any breach of the code.  In a message to staff he said: \u0026ldquoI would like to reassure you that the appointment was in line with the university\u0026rsquos procedures and complies with the code of good governance.  \u0026ldquoThere was full involvement of the board in the appointment and the governors were unanimous in their decision to ask John to step up to the role of principal.  Mr Fleming said the board was aware that normal practice was to go through a competitive process, but added: \u0026ldquoGiven this exceptional set of circumstances the board is sure effective governance was best served on this occasion with the decisive action to appoint John.  Former principal Professor Ferdinand von Prondzynski quit his \u0026pound278,000 post at the university this week after his business partner was appointed to a top role at the institution.

However many will still have an anxious wait to find out their fate.In a stock market announcement, Sports Direct said it had acquired all 59 House of Fraser stores, the brand and all of the retailer\u0026rsquos stock. A previous restructuring plan had slated 31 stores for closure.  Some 17,000 staff have been informed that they will be transferred over from House of Fraser to Sports Direct. However, doubt remains over the long-term future of jobs and it seems likely some underperforming stores will still close as part of a rescue programme.  Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, said only that Sports Direct will \u0026ldquodo our best to keep as many stores open as possible but added: \u0026ldquoMy ambition is to transform House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street.

The Sports Direct chief described the deal as a massive step forward and part of his \u0026ldquostrategy of elevation across a group which includes he luxury fashion chain Flannels.  According to industry sources, Mr Ashley now intends to turn some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under the Flannels brand.

C.banner had been planning to buy a 51% stake in House of Fraser and plough \u0026pound70 million into the ailing retailer.  The new deal appears to mean the scrapping of the previous restructuring plans and a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) under which House of Fraser had agreed with landlords to close half of stores, with 6,000 jobs under threat.  Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely ambitious move for Sports Direct. The combination of both businesses will yield some vital cost-saving synergies while it\u0026rsquos likely that some of the struggling House of Fraser sites will be rebranded to Sports Direct. Nevertheless, this is a part of the industry that is under a huge amount of pressure. The stores are failing to attract sustainable levels of footfall while battling against rising operating costs and shifts in shopper behaviour.  Adam French, Which? Consumer Rights expert, called on the company to honour existing obligations to customers. \u0026ldquoThat means accepting gift vouchers, fulfilling online shopping orders and processing returns and refunds as if nothing has changed, he said.

Unite said poor pay and working practices at Sports Direct should not be transferred into the department store chain.

Of course they do. And by the time they hit 50 they are soaked in knowledge, their sparkle and wit enhanced, and as such become concentrated catnip to the female world.  Now, there is little scientific evidence (yet) to support all of this theory. Psychologists however have underlined the importance of the Halo Effect, whereby you unconsciously take one aspect of somebody as a proxy for their overall character so when women discover the older man to have seen When Harry Met Sally at least three times, they\u0026rsquore allure becomes immeasurable.  They sense themselves in the presence of a creature who can put his finger on the pulse of modern society as easily as he can the G Spot.  They will believe this man has learned cleverness. He will know implicitly, for example, that women very often say the opposite to what they actually think. And they will know he knows exactly the right time to lie delightfully (eg, \u0026ldquoYes, that dress goes perfectly with those shoes). And love him for it. Sexy or what?  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRed faces found to be more attractive  In a physical sense, men age exceptionally well, particularly if they can avoid steakbakes and afford hair transplants. Yes, cartilage degeneration is unavoidable, and morning knees ache but women see this as attractive, knowing the acher will no longer spend half the week on the five-a-sides pitch. More time to do couply stuff.!  The added bonus of advancing years is that men slow down their lager intake. Thus, dinner party dribbling is diminished. (Dribbling confined to sleep, and that little morning incontinence). Indeed, age and less drink means females can often hear meaningful sentences being constructed.  What age offers, paradoxically, is we men develop an even greater immaturity. The pressures of career pursuit and back-breaking finance having subsided, this frees up the older fella to reclaim his inner (That\u0026rsquoll Be The Day period) David Essex. And now, literally or figuratively, he can wear a leather jacket and silver earring, and spin a girl on the waltzers.  After all, isn\u0026rsquot this all a woman wants? And unattainablilty of course. At 50, men are often broken by failed romance, which makes them completely attainable, but somehow age allows our acting skills to emerge, a patina of confidence, to the point we can suggest the haughty indifference of youth.  There are more reasons why ladies are drawn to us. We know the words and chords to James Taylor\u0026rsquos You\u0026rsquove Got A Friend, we can quote lines from Tennyson and The Inbetweeners and we can salsa. If push comes to shove, we can also do the slosh, (learned while working during student holidays at the United Services Club in Johnstone).  The older man may even have a sports car by this age, which hints of attention-seeking tragedy. But this is in fact a bonus. Women will take such a sad figure to their bosom, for the same reason they love the man who no longer lives with his mum, yet still takes his wooly jumpers to be washed.  Yes, there are some older men who by50 have bought a bike and pulled on lycra. But by the time snow appears that nonsense usually melts.

It\u0026rsquos the law of the jungle, Darwin, survival of the most fertile and all that.

Clearly, there is something more complex going on here that makes men more popular the closer they get to 50.  Pity, for instance. Choosing older males could be a selfless act on the part of the women to make men feel better about themselves.  Women do this all the time.

How would they feel, however, to see their gifts fenced off from general use and trampled by festival fans?  In Glasgow this summer, Kelvingrove Park has been commandeered by Fiesta x FOLD, an event that began last year in the park\u0027s bandstand but this year spreadeagled into the greenspace proper. This meant large hoardings going up to prevent passers-by being able to glimpse performances for free and a national cycle route closed to accommodate it.  Residents at Glasgow Green had it the worst in the city with the TRNSMT music festival, which ran over two weekends before the singer Bruno Mars took up residence. The combined events put the space out of use for a month. Local residents complained of having what is, essentially, their garden removed from them.  Of course, the organisers of TRNSMT came back swinging, saying the event was of wider economic benefit to Glasgow, residents had been offered tickets and it was a chance to show off the city to the international performers who took part.  Kelvingrove and Glasgow Green are not the only city parks being hawked for profit.  There is a licensing application in for a German beer festival on Queen\u0027s Park Recreation Ground, which was already used in June by Zippos circus.  In Victoria Park there is a stooshie over plans from Glasgow City Council\u0027s Land and Environmental Services to grass over 28 of the main flower beds in the formal gardens at the end of the summer.  These are Victorian flower beds, part of a landscape listed by Historic Environment Scotland, and the Friends of Victoria Park group puts up a thin edge of the wedge argument against the local authority\u0027s intentions, believing the remaining flower beds will soon also be under threat. Already the park has lost planting at its bowling greens and in its, again historic, Fossil Grove.  The council suggests the Friends might like to take over the flower beds but, firstly, it is a large ask from a small volunteer group and, secondly, that takes paid work from council employees.  Trying to pass responsibilities for parks onto Friends groups is a common tactic seen from local authorities around Britain as maintenance budgets are slashed.  Victoria Park recently hosted FriendsFest, an event based on the American sit-com. Friends of Victoria Park wanted the council to pledge to use any money from FriendsFest to maintain the flowerbeds, however, income generated by the parks is pooled and shared out generally among the council\u0027s Land and Environmental Services.  In Edinburgh, hoardings have gone up around Princes Street Gardens to prevent sight of the Summer Sessions event, to general dismay.  The argument runs that an entrepreneurial city should monetise its assets in straightened times, even if that\u0027s using a park as a drive-in movie theatre or music venue.  But parks, the lungs of our cities, are a special case and not to be colonised by private events. Functional and beautiful playgrounds for adults and children, they are gardens for those who live in flats. They cool the air of cities in summer temperatures. Parks support current key policy areas - outdoor play in education and a need to encourage exercise to stave off obesity. They are good for mental health.  Most of all, they are \"ours\", a collective, shared and, importantly, free amenity, and so the privatisation and commercialisation of open spaces feels jarring. It cannot be right to prevent use of these common plots for the sake of limited numbers of people.  There is, however, only so much charity to be gleaned from local communities and only so much revenue in council coffers.  If the parks must earn their keep, above all they already give us, then there should be discussions about more creative, less intrusive ways to do it. A good start would be a cap on the number of days a year a park can be out of general commission. They must not become event spaces first and parks second.  Parks exist as rare egalitarian spaces where equal access for all should be enshrined.  They are public property, not revenue streams and to make them so would be a short sighted move. Without a campaigning body, it\u0027s up to communities to protect their parks. Start by using them: the more people are using them, the less likely we are to lose them."},{"url":null,"title":"final-day-of-trading-for-several-marks-spencer-stores","story":"  The retailer announced in May that it plans to close 100 stores by 2022, putting hundreds of jobs at risk.

Here is everything you need to know:  The Perseid meteor shower is caused by debris falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle when it comes into contact with the Earth\u0026rsquos atmosphere. The comet orbits the Sun every 133 years.  The meteors, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the atmosphere at 58 kilometres (36 miles) per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.  Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648 to 5,537C (3,000 to 10,000 Fahrenheit) as they speed across the sky.  The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.  The peak time for Perseid watching will be Sunday night and before dawn on Monday, but the meteors may already be making an appearance.  Dr Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe shower will be visible all over the UK, as long as the skies are clear.  \u0026ldquoUnlike a lot of celestial events, meteor showers are easy to watch and no special equipment is needed, although a reclining chair and a blanket make viewing much more comfortable.  Affelia Wibisono, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: \u0026ldquoObservers are in luck this year as it coincides with the moon setting shortly after sunset to leave a dark night sky.  \u0026ldquoThose who have perfect conditions may be able to see 80 meteors per hour \u0026ndash however, this is unlikely to be the case for most people, especially those in urban areas.  \u0026ldquoLight pollution greatly decreases the number of meteors visible so head out to the countryside and let your eyes become dark adapted by not looking at any bright lights for at least 15 minutes."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-the-golden-age-of-railways-as-uk-marks-anniversary-of-end-of-steam","story":"  The event will feature the 70013 Oliver Cromwell, which was used during the charter return trip from Liverpool to Carlisle via Manchester 50 years ago.

But the Daily Mail said that its own visit to the Martyrs Ceremony had shown that the memorial was 15 yards away from the spot where Mr Corbyn was pictured holding a wreath, in photographs held in the Palestinian Embassy website archive.

His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point.

And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

pub in Fortrose is up for sale with an asking price of nearly half a million pounds.The Anderson bar and restaurant, featuring 13-guest rooms, nine of which are en-suite, is up for grabs for \u0026pound449,995.The traditional black-and-white inn dates from 1840s, however the cellars are believed to be older.Owners Jim And Anne Anderson say they are ready to move on after raising their son, who is now 18 and heading to university, in the hotel, which they purchased in 2003.The couple, who emigrated from Philadelphia, also have a home on the Black Isle.Mr Anderson (61) said the property was \"a viable family business in a setting that was a great place for a family to live and raise their children\".He said he would sell it as a house or as a hotel business but added: \"If I could pick and choose our buyer I would say it would be someone a lot like us who would have a vision of where they want to take it. It\u0026rsquos a flexible industry.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That\u0026rsquos why this is important.\"It\u0026rsquos being set up so we can say to everyone \u0026lsquowe are part of society, we are here, we\u0026rsquore just people, there\u0026rsquos nothing scary about us, we\u0026rsquore just like everybody else, out to have a bit of fun\u0026rsquo.\"The forum, supporting people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex is seeking permission from Highland Council to stage the October 6 march.Eden Court in Inverness will be the main event hub with stalls in the foyer, and lectures, exhibitions, screenings and debates in the La Scala Cinema and the MacLean Room.Fringe events will take place on other dates across the Highlands including Portree on August 25 and Ullapool on September 1.The spokeswoman from Highland LGBTI said it aimed to break barriers, spread awareness and create a show of solidarity for the LGBTI community.She knows first-hand how daunting it is for people to \"come out\", but her experience in Inverness was positive.She said rural areas sometimes tell a different story.\"Inverness is not too bad,\" she said. \"But if you go further afield it gets more difficult. I have been to a college fresher\u0026rsquos fair on Skye. They invite us each year and we have a stall, which is great.\"The people that we meet have no problems at all.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It goes without saying that as a Conservative councillor I don’t support the break-up of the UK, and those Craigentinny/Duddingston voters who gave me their first preference at last year’s election knew exactly what they were endorsing. Similarly, those who endorsed SNP candidates knew they were advancing the cause of independence.            At least that’s the way it’s supposed to work, but that assumption has been challenged this week by the decision of my former Conservative group colleague Ashley Graczyk to embrace Nationalism in so doing she has turned her back on the 1,600 people in Sighthill/Gorgie who gave their first preference to a candidate whose campaign literature said “We don’t want a second referendum” above a picture of her with Ruth Davidson.            Across the city, those people who opposed independence but didn’t support the Conservatives had the choice of voting for the Labour or Lib Dem candidates, but they voted for the candidate they thought best placed to oppose the SNP and as a result the Conservatives won the highest number of first preferences.Although it was a council election, there was no doubt the national picture was at the forefront of voters’ minds, while local concerns for people likely to vote Tory centred on initiatives closely associated with the Labour-SNP administration like the tram project and the blanket 20mph speed limit. First-time candidates like Ashley and I should have been under no illusion people would be voting for the party, not individuals.READ MORE: Ashley Graczyk: Why I quit as Tory councillor and now back independenceThe basis of the system relies on the candidates knowing exactly what they are representing. What they can’t do is within a matter of months say it’s all been a big mistake, that they didn’t really understand what they were representing, but then hang on to the seat and the allowance.  Councillor Graczyk hasn’t quite been able to make the full leap to membership of the SNP, and although her conversion to Nationalism hasn’t quite been Damascean, as recently as April she was posting pictures of herself on social media with a Union Flag.            Three SNP Edinburgh councillors have also left their parties, one following allegations of misconduct and the other two because of in-fighting, and while I still believe all three should have resigned, none have renounced the banner of independence under which they were elected. Ashley was elected as a representative of the Scottish Conservative \u0026amp Unionist party by people who believed in the Union and change in the council. She no longer represents us and the only way to find out if the views of those electors of Sighthill/Gorgie who backed her have altered is to ask them. If she really believes in representative democracy she should resign and fight a by-election.Bojo the publicity seeker strikes againSomeone whose loyalty to the Conservative cause has never been in any doubt is Eastwood MSP Jackson Carlaw, fighting campaign after campaign throughout the years when the Scottish party was at its lowest ebb.              For him, whatever may be going on behind the scenes public unity is an absolute, so I can only guess at how angry he was to use social media to condemn Boris Johnson over his Daily  burka column. “Just to be clear this is not a debate about the prevalence of the burka”, he tweeted. “It is about the casual, typically sensationalist and gratuitously offensive rhetoric deployed by Boris Johnson. It has caused real offence to many of my constituents. Bluntly, I’m fed up with him. Enough.”He was on relatively safe ground, given both Theresa May and Ruth Davidson had called on Johnson to apologise, and he now faces a formal party investigation. The problem was not the point of the article, which argued against a ban “because it is inevitably construed – rightly or wrongly – as being intended to make some point about Islam”, but his description of Muslim women looking like letter boxes or bank robbers. His critics would doubtless agree with the conclusion that “if you go for a total ban, you play into the hands of those who want to politicise and dramatise the so-called clash of civilisations”. Indeed, Ruth Davidson’s comparison with banning crucifixes is echoed in the article, pointing out that prohibition of veils would “risk a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation.”READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Boris the Cad pales in Lord Carrington’s noble shadowHaving duly fanned the flames of grievance, he predicted “you risk turning people into martyrs”, but Johnson is no martyr. Quite the opposite. Having made what was for him a low-key resignation speech and Westminster now becalmed in recess, he has successfully grabbed the headlines without actually calling for anything, and what might otherwise have been a 24-hour story could go on for days.            The greater the outrage, the greater the publicity which in turn feeds the outrage and mounts pressure on an increasingly compromised inquiry. The party is hanged if it doesn’t punish him and hanged if it does, while Johnson carries on regardless. If it had been a genuine misjudgement in which his eagerness to entertain went too far, then it would have simple to issue an immediate retraction. He didn’t.Maybe he will issue an “if I’ve caused offence” apology today, just in time to catch the Sunday papers and political shows in sleepy August, or maybe we all have to wait until the next instalment in Monday’s . But he’ll have had a week’s worth of publicity, appealed to a sizeable chunk of the electorate who won’t even have read the article, and been paid about £5,000 for the piece into the bargain. Just a couple of stinging similes and bingo, everyone is talking about old Bojo again. Shameless isn’t in it.No US trip for council deputationAnother withdrawal up at Edinburgh City Chambers, not a councillor, but the offer from the council’s IT supplier CGI to fly a group of five officials and councillors to the US and Canada to demonstrate how well they operate after mounting complaints about their performance here. Why the change of heart? Surely it can’t be because an anonymous councillor snitched to the Evening News? Or perhaps CGI realised a clean bill of health from the delegation could lead to accusations, however unfounded, of buying off criticism while the opposite would mean the company had met the cost of a kicking.No hold-ups on affordable housing\u2028Getting on with the day job... After the Prime Minister and First Minister formally signed off the £1.3bn Edinburgh Region City Deal this week, attention now switches to delivery. So much has been promised about the positive impact the investment will have that public expectation needs careful management, but there should be no hold-up with Edinburgh’s affordable house-building programme now the council has ownership of large tracts of land in Granton and approved the management process to create 4,000 new homes."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780918.1533923697!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment house of fraser s fate now in mike ashley s hands","story":"        Market forces swept away House of Fraser, a giant of the high street, but Mike Ashley\u0026#8217s controversial Sport Direct empire will now try to put it back on its feet.                House of Fraser has a special place in the hearts of many Scots.

It’s not just a shop, it’s part of many people’s lives.            But, as Woolworths discovered, nostalgia doesn’t count for much in terms of hard currency.

READ MORE: House of Fraser: Mike Ashley ‘to keep as many stores open as possible’While rival department store John Lewis moved quickly to create an effective online business, House of Fraser appears to have dawdled, only belatedly realising the extent of the transformation in buying habits.In addition, its 59 department stores contained hundreds of concessions, meaning that its own brand products – which could have been House of Fraser’s “unique selling point” – were overshadowed and overlooked. If ever a high street shop needed a strong reason to persuade people to actually visit the store, it is now. Next month, John Lewis plans to trial having personal stylists in-store and holding evening classes for precisely this reason.  A failure to recognise the need to innovate proved House of Fraser’s downfall, so one thing is certain after Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct bought it out of administration – change is coming. Ashley has talked about turning the chain into the “Harrods of the high street”, an ambitious plan that may test the public’s appetite for luxury. But experts also speculated that some stores could be turned into restaurants, bars, hotels and offices or be divided up into smaller shops.            Staff are likely to be nervous, even if their jobs are saved. In 2016, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee said it had found evidence of “extremely disturbing” working practices at Sports Direct with staff penalised for taking a break to drink water or being ill and it also reported claims that workers were offered permanent contracts in exchange for sex.However, just as House of Fraser swallowed up stores like Arnotts, Binns and Jenners, Ashley’s business empire has now absorbed it. His task will be to leave the 1900s behind and find a 21st century business model.READ MORE: House of Fraser falls into administration"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday. Photo: Kevin Jones\nThe Shetland men’s football and women’s hockey teams go head to head with their Orkney opponents in tomorrow’s inter-county matches.\nBoth games are at Pickaquoy in Kirkwall, with the hockey at noon and the football following at 2pm.\nA celebratory dinner will take place in the evening to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup football encounter, and a veterans’ game is due to be played on Sunday morning.\nAs far as the main football match is concerned, Shetland manager Kevin Main is optimistic that his side can get a good result and keep hold of the trophy which they regained with a 2-0 win in Lerwick last year.\nHe said: “I feel it’s very important to be confident going in to any type of sporting arena. I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 11 Aug 2018 2:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one.

We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27422  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald speaking after meeting with Theresa May.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nIt is now clear that the British Prime Minister has come here to pick a fight with the Ireland to pick a fight with the European Union. - Mary Lou McDonald\nBritish Prime Minster Theresa May came to the north \"to pick a fight\" with Ireland and the EU, Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said today. \nThe Sinn Féin President met Theresa May in Belfast this morning alongside Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill and Conor Murphy. \nThe Tory leader is in the north on a two-day visit to discuss Brexit and other issues. She visited the border in Fermanagh yesterday and made a speech in Belfast\u0027s Waterfront Hall this morning.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm. For more information or to book an appointment, contact Richard on 07901518863 or by emailing richard.gill@ulsterbank.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37182721.ece/ffb3d/AUTOCROP/w65square/60817JP1parade002.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

At this point in the Brexit negotiations there is very little we could put past this government who seem prepared to sign up to almost anything in the name of Brexit, and oblivious to the tension these proposals create. Despite two years of platitudes, the UK Government and their DUP sidekicks have taken absolutely no opportunities to provide meaningful reassurance on post-Brexit arrangements. To make these provisions at this time is unbelievably tone deaf,\" the South Belfast MLA said.\n\n“It is an affront to the peace Agreement that Theresa May would allow any hardening of the border, let alone providing for ‘stop and search’ zones.\n\n“As the months go by and the Government becomes increasingly closer to crashing out of the European Union, people here are again those most likely to be the casualties of their incompetence.\n\n“The SDLP have been consistently clear that Northern Ireland must stay part of the Single Market and Customs Union in order to prevent any border either on this island or down the Irish Sea.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSDLP MLA Claire Hanna\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37205645.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/s_Eye_-_Belfa%20163.jpg","title":"clarification mike nesbitt","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour.

Previously, Gerry Adams has called the report \u0027common sense\u0027,\" the Strangford MLA said.\n\n\"Behind some of the claims that \u0027everyone’s a winner\u0027 in this united-Ireland however there lies a reliance on supposition and wishful thinking to build a case.\n\n\"Looking at just some of the issues included in the report’s ‘Ten Point Plan’ sheds some light on the strength of the case put forward.\n\n\"The report assumes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA report has claimed Northern Ireland could be financially better off in a united Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued UK government subvention to Northern Ireland for approximately thirty years.\n\nAn immediate £10billion contribution to infrastructure by the UK government.\n\nThe UK government will continue to fund pension costs.\"\n\nMr Hamilton said that reunification would cost thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Interestingly, the report does not dwell too long on its view that 50,000 public sector workers in Northern Ireland would have to be made redundant. However even in this area it expects the United Kingdom Exchequer to bear all the costs,\" he said.\n\n\"All these highlight the lack of substance behind many of those who claim a united-Ireland is some kind of inevitability.

Tony Hughes and Jake McGerrigan - killed by soldiers in 1973.\n\nUUP councillor Sam Nicholson said the decision by organisers, the West Armagh Consortium, to laud an individual who died on a \"murder mission\" was the \"height of insensitivity\".\n\n\"It sends out a very negative message to the unionist community and especially to people in the area who suffered at the hands of IRA terrorism throughout the Troubles,\" he said. \n\nThe fresh criticism comes after the consortium released a statement defending its decision to name festival events after people who are \"significant\" to the local community. \n\n\"There are over 10 events named after local people, not all who died violently,\" they said.\n\nThey also questioned why unionist politicians had singled out Tuesday\u0027s event given in the past its members had supported the festival since its inception.\n\n\"The West Armagh Community Festival has been in operation for over 20 years and in that time has been officially opened by mayors and lord mayors from all parties within Armagh City and District Council (ACDC),\" the organisers said. \n\n\"The events causing upset to members of the unionist parties have been part of the festival since its early days, so why are unionist politicians up in arms now, considering that they participated in its official opening over the years and witnessed some of the events in question.\"\n\nThey pointed out Mr Nicholson\u0027s UUP colleague, Julie Flaherty, attended the festival\u0027s sponsored charity run and walk held yesterday in aid of Lisanally Special School and Armagh Breast Cancer Support in her capacity as the local Lord Mayor.\n\nHowever, she said it should not been seen as an \"endorsement\" of the festival\u0027s support of dead IRA terrorists.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser gets new owner but customers remain in dark over gift cards","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s still unclear what the status of the CVA is following the takeover.\n\nWhen asked for clarity on the status of its anchor tenant, Victoria Square declined to comment, stating that it does not comment on individual brands within the centre.\n\nThere is also uncertainty for people left holding gift vouchers, with staff in Belfast informing some customers yesterday that they would not be accepting them \"until further notice\".\n\nShoppers were quick to air their frustration on social media, but some said they had been able to redeem their vouchers online.\n\nJohn French, chief executive of The Consumer Council, said: \"If a new company buys over the business, it will be at the new company\u0027s discretion whether to honour gift cards or vouchers.\n\n\"If you have a House of Fraser gift card/voucher, you might like to check with the person who gave you the gift card or voucher to see if it was purchased using a credit or Visa card.\n\n\"Such purchases have additional protection and a full refund may be provided by the card issuer.\"\n\nMike Ashley had been in competition with the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Philip Day, to buy out the chain.\n\nSources said he could soon begin the process of turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under his upmarket Flannels outlet.\n\nHe described the transaction as a \"massive step forward\" for his firm, adding: \"This will benefit both House of Fraser and Flannels in the luxury sector.\n\n\"We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible. It is vital that we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands.\n\n\"Our deal was conservative, consistent and simple.\n\n\"My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street.\"\n\nLike so many retail names, House of Fraser has fallen victim to the rise in discount stores and the shift in consumer habits from physical purchase to online shopping.\n\nAodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, believes House of Fraser\u0027s problems should be a warning for action to prevent the demise of the high street.\n\nHe said: \"This is a critical period for the retail industry, caused by a perfect storm of pressures including rising costs and new technology changing how people shop.\n\n\"How much more news like this will it take before we have action to support retailers by cutting the inequitable and antiquated business rates bill?\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland chippies take carryouts to new heights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mallon of the Dolphin Takeaway in Dungannon will undertake The Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge, serving up delights for hungry climbers at 15,255ft.\n\nArriving in Tanzania on September 1, the duo will climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, before setting up the highest pop-up fish and chip shop at the Barafu Camp.\n\nThey\u0027re aiming to raise much-needed funds for the Fishermen\u0027s Mission charity as a thank you to the trawler crews who keep their businesses supplied with the sea\u0027s bounty. \n\nAlan said he was proud to support the \"worthy\" charity, which helps those working in the fishing trade, the most dangerous occupation in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Malachy and I have seen first-hand the great work the Fishermen\u0027s Mission carries out to support the fishermen who put their lives on the line to supply us with product. \n\n\"So I suppose the idea was born out of the need to raise awareness and much-needed funds for them. \n\n\"Malachy suggested the Kilimanjaro idea to me last year at the National Federation of Fish Friers Annual Ball and I instantly agreed to take up the challenge for this worthy cause. \n\n\"All of the donations we can get will make such a difference to those facing hardship.\"\n\nThe Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge is the latest charity effort for Malachy, after he raised £9,000 by cycling 1,500 miles around the UK, visiting the winners of the Fish and Chip awards 2017.\n\nThe pair will climb for eight consecutive days, before cooking fish and chips and a few other favourites for the local orphanage before their record attempt. \n\nA percentage of the funds raised will be donated to the Fortune Kids and Education Foundation Orphanage Centre, which was opened in February 2016 and cares for children under five. \n\nWith the trip to Africa looming next month, Alan said they had stepped up their preparations.\n\n\"Although I live right in the heart of the Mournes, I had no previous climbing experience, but that has changed since last October,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been out trekking the mountains at least once a week for the last 10 months and this last month we have upped our training, sometimes covering five peaks and a distance of 25km a day.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37202535.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/5_The_annual_Appren.jpg","title":"northern ireland

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"two ulster grand prix riders in serious incident during race","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

The overwhelming majority of One-Day Delivery orders are delivered when promised.\n\n“A small proportion of orders missed the delivery promise last year during a period of extreme weather that impacted all carriers across the UK, and we provided support to impacted customers at the time.”\n\nThis is not the first time Amazon has been found in breach of ASA rules.\n\nIn April, four ads for electronic items were banned for using “misleading” recommended retail prices (RRPs) and savings claims.\n\nThe ads, seen in July 2017 for a television, gaming monitor, laptop and electric toothbrush, all listed RRPs and savings of up to £300.\n\nEach ad received a single complaint that the savings were misleading and unsubstantiated.\n\nThe ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form, adding: “We told Amazon to ensure that future references to RRPs reflected the price at which the products concerned were generally sold, and to ensure that they held adequate evidence to substantiate their savings claims.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"everything you need to know about the perseid meteor shower","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The comet orbits the Sun every 133 years.\n\nThe meteors, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the atmosphere at 58 kilometres (36 miles) per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.\n\nPeak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648 to 5,537C (3,000 to 10,000 Fahrenheit) as they speed across the sky.\n\nThe meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.\n\nHow will you be able to watch it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe peak time for Perseid watching will be Sunday night and before dawn on Monday, but the meteors may already be making an appearance.\n\nDr Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, said: “The shower will be visible all over the UK, as long as the skies are clear.\n\n“Unlike a lot of celestial events, meteor showers are easy to watch and no special equipment is needed, although a reclining chair and a blanket make viewing much more comfortable.”\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Tom White/PA)\n\n\n\n\nAffelia Wibisono, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: “Observers are in luck this year as it coincides with the moon setting shortly after sunset to leave a dark night sky.\n\n“Those who have perfect conditions may be able to see 80 meteors per hour – however, this is unlikely to be the case for most people, especially those in urban areas.\n\n“Light pollution greatly decreases the number of meteors visible so head out to the countryside and let your eyes become dark adapted by not looking at any bright lights for at least 15 minutes.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures the golden age of railways as uk marks anniversary of end of steam","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The area has been refurbished with a modern new monochrome-themed interior complete with beautiful Amelia Earhart artwork as a tribute to the famous first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. As well as comfortable new seating and tables, free internet access and free view television entertainment, access to complimentary refreshments and a serene view of the beautiful hills of Donegal.\n\nAirport Manager, Charlene Shongo, expressed her delight at the re-opening event: “We are absolutely thrilled that the Amelia Earhart Lounge has been restored, providing an additional space for our passengers to relax. The lounge is ideal for business and leisure customers seeking a quiet space and a little luxury in advance of their flight.\n\n“Access to the lounge is just £10pp and can be booked online on our website and includes complimentary tea/coffee and soft drink, newspapers and magazines and much, much more to enhance the overall airport experience.

He has also managed ‘pacers’ since the 2013 Walled City Marathon 2013 (organised to coincide with ‘City of Culture’ year and the first marathon held in Derry for almost 30 years).\n\n“On race day I will be managing a team of 12 ‘pacers’ said Paddy. “Indeed, our pacing team are experienced runners tasked with completing the course in a specific time – at 15-minute intervals between 1hr 30 and 2hrs 30 for this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n“Holding an even or steady pace throughout a race – as well as combating early adrenaline-fuelled enthusiasm by runners for a fast start – is just one part of the job” says Paddy.\n\n“The pacers are also personal motivators during the race itself. They will help runners along with shouts of encouragement and regular progress updates – and really can make the difference between a disappointing finish to a race and a resounding success.\n\n“Most marathons and half marathons have pacers nowadays” said Paddy. “And they are proving very popular! The Council and organisers of this year’s half marathon are keen to do what they can to improve the experience for runners. Indeed, last year’s participants couldn’t praise the pacers enough for the assistance they provided in helping them to achieve their personal bests (PBs).\n\n“The runners also paid tribute to ‘the craic’ they had with the pacers and for adding so much to the camaraderie of the race itself.”\n\nPaddy says that the pacers in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon will help people to run as evenly as possible or ‘hold an even mile pace’ as he calls it. “If your goal is to finish this year’s half marathon in 2 hours, running with a 2-hour pacer will help you to maintain an average pace of 9 minutes 9 seconds per mile” he said.\n\n“I can’t stress enough how important it is to have pacers at a race. We’re therefore looking forward again this year to help runners get their speed right.\n\n“Following a pacer is also one less thing to worry about – and can really take the pressure off a runner” Paddy says. “On race day there is a lot to think about – from getting there on time to managing hydration or fuel intake during the race. Therefore, runners have enough to be thinking about without also worrying about their pace!”\n\n“Following a pacer will allow you to get your head down, focus on the running and be guided to the finish line in your target time” said Paddy.\n\n“Pacing yourself sensibly during the course of the race – especially amid the excitement and adrenaline of the start – is key to ensuring that it is less of a struggle, particularly for a first-time or beginner” he said. “That’s not to say that it won’t still be a physical challenge – it will – but pacing yourself will help prevent people from struggling or having to stop.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241829\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The pacers and the group of runners following the pacer will also offer motivation – giving you something to cling on to or spur you on if you’re struggling to keep up – as they are all in the same boat and will be trying to achieve the same goal. This creates a camaraderie that just can’t be matched by running on your own” Paddy said.\n\n“People also ask ‘How do I pick the right half marathon pacer?’ Choosing which pacer to follow will depend a lot on your training. I would therefore recommend you set a realistic target time, particularly if this is your first half marathon.\n\n“I’d also advise beginners to err on the side of caution. If you want to have a positive experience, don’t set a goal that’s over-stretching yourself. Set a target time that’s challenging but achievable” he said.\n\n\nMeet the pacers\n\n\nDuring this year’s Waterside Half Marathon Paddy will manage 12 pacers in total – 3 pacers for 1hr 30 (Jason Scott, Rodney Agnew and Andy Gray), 2 for 1hr 45 (Darren Madden and Gary Moore), 3 for 2hrs (Gregory O’Brien, Shaun McLaughlin and Paddy McLaughlin), 2 for 2hrs 15 (Stuart Campbell and Andrea Cairns) and 2 for 2hrs 30 (Helena Doran and Claire Martin).\n\nPaddy explains the reason that there are 3 pacers (instead of two) for the 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times is because they’re the most popular in terms of runners who are hoping to achieve a target or beat their personal best (PB).\n\n“The 1hr 30 or ‘90-minute’ finish time is a big hurdle that a lot of runners want to get over.” he said. “The same can also be said of other runners who want to break the 2hr mark.\n\n“We therefore have 3 pacers running in 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times. During the course of the race one of the pacers may drop back a little from the pack to spur on runners who are struggling. Of the two who are left – particularly when it comes to the final stages of the race – one may decide to guide a group of runners to the finish line who are definitely feeling ok and really want to go ‘flat out’ to beat their PB – while the last / remaining pacer will stay with the original group of runners” said Paddy.\n\n“We really want to see as many runners as possible achieve their goals – and it is so rewarding to see them at the finish line having done just that” he said.\n\n“So if you\u0027re planning to take part in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon, I would urge you to join up with one of the pacers before the race begins on Sunday 2 September. Indeed, our team of pacers will be identified by ‘pacer vests’ and coloured balloons corresponding with the finish times. Runners who are taking part in the half marathon will also be encouraged to join the pacers via announcements at the start line on the morning of the race.” \n\nPaddy concluded: “You really will be great hands – and the entire pacing team is hoping to help even more runners this year achieve those all-important PBs!”\n\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13th August 2018 and you can register online now at \nwww.derrystrabane/whm\n - where you will also find further information on this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\nPictured above: Last year\u0027s pacers in action preparing for the Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk//resources/images/8123616.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"newtown first look for residents at 32m new","story":"\nAt the Mid Wales Housing Association preview event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown, ar\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gte Ffion Jones, aged \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtfive, and three-year-old Trystan Jones and Summer Jones, nine.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143330/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Nathan Pritchard, John Bowen, Dylan Pritchard, Lisa Davies, Madison Pritchard and Keira Davies.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143332/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Ffion Jones (5) and Trystan Jones (3) and Summer Jones (9)\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143333/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                                            \n"},{"url":null,"title":"presteigne carnival 2018 sunshine and live music added to the fun at","story":"\nPIC 10: THE Primary School’s Royal Wedding float in all its glory during the P\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtresteigne Carnival d\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtay parade.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143390/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 1: CARNIVAL Queen Sophie Preece after her crowning with attendants Phoebe Ka\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gttsaitis, Menna Baynh\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtam, Mair Thomas and Kameron Traylor.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143392/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 2: A BIG turnout by the Celtic Dragons Motorbike Club saw them joining the p\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtarade and staging a \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtstatic display on the Carnival Field before going on to present The Woodchoppers Ball at their headquarters The Woodchoppers Arms in Knighton R\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143393/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 3: PUPILS of Presteigne Primary School.
