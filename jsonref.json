[{"url":null,"title":"The story picture Andrew Virginia Giuffre Maxwell journalist scooped world","story":"Share this article She was headhunted for the job by Maxwell, who spotted her at Donald Trump\u0027s Mar a Lago club in Palm Beach, where she was a $9-an-hour changing-room assistant and her father was a maintenance manager.The club employed scores of workers in similar positions over the years, but gradually I accumulated clues: a source recalled that her maiden name was Virginia Roberts.And I learned that she continued to date her high-school sweetheart, Tony Figueroa, after Maxwell trained her to give Epstein \u0027erotic massages\u0027.His family\u0027s address was in old property records. They\u0027d moved from Palm Beach, a neighbour told me when I knocked on her door, but she remembered Virginia.\u0027She was a sad, anorexic-looking girl,\u0027 she said.I located Tony in the small town of Flowery Branch, Georgia – an eight-hour drive north of Palm Beach – and he confirmed what had seemed a totally incredible tale.Epstein had approved of him continuing his romance with Virginia, he told me when we met at a coffee shop.\u0027I moved into her apartment in Royal Palm Beach. She was working for Jeffrey. I assume the cash she got from him paid for it.\u0027I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there – sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend. I never got any weird vibes until she told me what was going on.\u0027And then the bombshell. When Tony picked up Virginia from a trip to London on Epstein\u0027s jet, she showed him a photo of herself with Prince Andrew.\u0027She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was supposedly just massages.\u0027He was sickened because he had come to understand that in Epstein\u0027s warped circles, massage was a euphemism for sex.\u0027I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn\u0027t. I think she was scared.\u0027Tony gave me the next lead to Virginia\u0027s whereabouts. Her father\u0027s name, he confided, was Sky Roberts. I left a message at his number, saying I was investigating Epstein.On February 4, 2011, an email landed that would change the course of history for Andrew.\u0027Hi Sharon,\u0027 Virginia wrote. \u0027My Father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I\u0027d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.\u0027When I called her Australian number, her voice was shaky but determined and the first word from her lips was \u0027Andrew\u0027.He was the Royal in her lawsuit, she told me, and, while initially reluctant to talk publicly, she eventually decided she wanted to waive her anonymity and tell her story because she was furious that he was still hanging out with Epstein after the financier\u0027s conviction for offences related to child prostitution.Just a few days before, she had seen a photo – published by the now defunct News of the World – that revealed the Prince had taken a stroll in Manhattan\u0027s Central Park with Epstein after the wealthy pervert had completed a slap- on-the-wrist jail sentence for abusing underage girls.She had also read about a dinner party that Epstein threw for Andrew during the New York visit, which was attended by celebrities including Woody Allen.Little could Andrew have known that that image of him casually chatting to his old friend in the park would end up so enraging Virginia she would agree to talk to me.\u0027I am appalled,\u0027 she told me when I arrived at her modest ranch home 60 miles north of Sydney. \u0027To me, it\u0027s saying, We are above the law.\u0027I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel from my home in New York via San Francisco to Sydney and then a 90-minute drive in a rental car on unfamiliar roads. But from the moment I set eyes on that picture, my jet-lag evaporated.For the entire journey I hadn\u0027t slept because Virginia had warned me she might not be able to find the picture.Now she had found it and, of course, I knew it was a huge scoop. But I had mixed emotions. This was a woman who was a victim of the most evil child sex ring I have heard about during my 40-year career.I was worried for Virginia and the fallout going public would have on her. I knew her life would never be the same again.She was clearly still absolutely terrified of Epstein. She told me she had seen shady characters hanging around her house who she was convinced had been sent by the billionaire to bully and intimidate her into silence.Yet here she was, bravely telling a story which would set off a cataclysmic chain of events that would change her life – and Andrew\u0027s – for ever.By the time I met Virginia, she was happily married to Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts expert whom she met by chance when Epstein flew her to Thailand for a massage course. They had two sons and a daughter.But she couldn\u0027t put the memories of her years in Epstein\u0027s cult-like household behind her. She wanted both him and Andrew to be brought to justice.We sat in her garden and I remember the terror in her eyes as she told her story to a journalist for the first time.She gave me a graphic description of the hours she claims to have spent with the Prince after Maxwell and Epstein left her on that London night. For reasons of taste, they can\u0027t be included here.\u0027It was disgusting,\u0027 she said, shaking her head.\u0027I\u0027ve gone from pain to hurt to anger. Coming from my background, I thought I was important, being with a big, famous man. But being a mother has changed my perspective on life.\u0027After my week-long first meetings with her, I received word that a US prosecutor, Ann Marie Villafana, was trying to reach me. She told me when I called that she had heard I was talking to Virginia.\u0027The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,\u0027 she said.Virginia wept when I passed on the message. She was still living in fear of Epstein. Would he hurt her, she wondered, if she co-operated with the FBI?And would it do any good? She had talked to some investigators just three years earlier, yet \u0027there\u0027s Jeffrey in Central Park with Andrew\u0027.She agreed to meet two FBI agents. Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.We weren\u0027t allowed to accompany Virginia inside, but she told us she confirmed the account she had given us and handed them her collection of snaps, including the print we had copied showing her with Maxwell and the Prince.They handed it back to her after making a scan.Since that day there has been much speculation about what happened to what has been dubbed the \u0027original\u0027 photograph.To the best of my knowledge, she still has it. I\u0027ve never heard anything about her destroying it.A redacted court document reportedly shows that she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 shown in a public record of the meeting.The FBI assigned sequential reference numbers to both the front and back of each photo. But two reference numbers – 03956 9431 and 03956 9432 – are missing from the publicly available document.Panorama was told those two numbers are for the front and back of the Andrew photo and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy.The lawmen refused to tell me their verdict on the picture. \u0027But if she faked it, they\u0027d have indicted her a long time ago for perjury,\u0027 I was told by a source familiar with the probe.A Californian digital photography expert, Hany Farid, told The Times he saw no \u0027obvious signs\u0027 that the photo was doctored.\u0027It can be difficult to get the body poses just right when splicing two people together,\u0027 he said.\u0027The fact that the two figures are so seamlessly and closely placed next to each other suggests that this is unlikely to be a full-body splice of Prince Andrew.\u0027The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene, suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew\u0027s head spliced on to another person\u0027s body,\u0027 he said.Without that photograph, no one would have taken Virginia\u0027s word over that of the Queen\u0027s favourite son.If Andrew still believes it was cooked up by a \u0027gold-digger\u0027, I\u0027m happy to take his call."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry renews Frogmore Cottage lease making eligible serve Queen Counsellor","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry will renew Frogmore Cottage lease to keep serving Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"Man City star Phil Foden mother involved scuffle","story":"Share this articlePhil Foden\u0027s mum Claire, 41, caught in alcohol-fuelled brawl which left a woman with black eyes and bite marks"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen 95 tested positive Covid mild cold like symptoms","story":" The monarch is expected to foot part of the bill for her son\u0027s settlement in a bid to draw a line under it before her much-anticipated Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer.But there is anger at how the Queen has effectively been forced to bail out the \u0027disgraced\u0027 Duke of York, 61, whose modest pension from his time in the Royal Navy is now his only visible income - amid calls for the public to be told who is financing the deal.Andrew marked the quietest royal birthday in modern history yesterday as he looks to lay low after settling his sex abuse case.The muted celebration of his 62nd birthday came just hours after the death of Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s \u0027pimp\u0027, who was accused of trafficking hundreds of girls to the paedophile financier.French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, 76, who allegedly procured more than a thousand women and girls for Epstein to sleep with, was found hanged in his prison cell in an alleged suicide on Saturday morning. And Charles could also be questioned by the Met Police as part of its criminal \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation into his aide and charity. The Royal, 73, nor anyone in his household have been spoken to as part of the force\u0027s assessment on whether to probe how a Saudi billionaire donor got a knighthood and UK citizenship after donations to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.Instead officers have liaised with staff at the charity, who have provided documents for the scoping exercise.But Charles and his former right-hand aide Michael Fawcett, 59, have been both explicitly named in the two letters to the Met that sparked the investigation. Fawcett stepped down in October amid claims he promised to help secure a CBE and British citizenship for Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz - a donor to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.It was alleged that he paid thousands of pounds to \u0027fixers\u0027 with links to the prince who said they could secure him an honour in return for donations.Clarence House has denied Charles knew anything about the allegations being investigated. And Prince Harry the monarch has also been dealing with revelations that Prince Harry tried to keep details of his legal battle to reinstate his police protection secret from the public.High Court documents show he sought a far-reaching confidentiality order on documents and witness statements surrounding his case against the Government.But the Home Office argued for transparency, saying \u0027there must be a sufficiently good reason, in the wider public interest, to justify the departure from open justice that such an order involves\u0027. The Queen\u0027s positive test comes as Boris Johnson today urged people to be \u0027more confident and get back to work\u0027 as he heralded this coming Thursday as Covid Freedom Day. The PM gave an upbeat assessment ahead of unveiling his \u0027Living with Covid Plan\u0027 tomorrow, insisting vaccines and new treatments can be relied upon to keep the public safe.All curbs - including legal self-isolation - are set to end in England within days, and Mr Johnson made clear that the taxpayer cannot keep shelling out £2billion a month on mass testing.In a compromise between the Treasury and Department of Health, he will lay out a timetable for axing free tests - but they are still likely to be available for more vulnerable and older age groups.As cases continue to tumble - down 25 per cent week-on-week - Mr Johnson insisted he did not want people to \u0027throw caution to the winds\u0027 but he wanted to remove \u0027compulsion\u0027 and let iniduals take responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"Covid infections plummet 37 week 25 696 cases PM plans Freedom Day","story":"Share this articlePowers to order national lockdowns will also end, with sources saying it would instead be up to local authorities to manage outbreaks. The PM is also expected to leave open the prospect that further Covid jabs could be given, saying he will be guided by expert vaccines body the JCVI.Responding to the Prime Minister\u0027s future blueprint for dealing with Covid, Labour said people should not be asked to pay for coronavirus tests.Armed forces minister James Heappey suggested on Thursday that Mr Johnson was likely to announce an end to free lateral flow tests as he called on the public to \u0027worry less about the need to have tested ourselves\u0027.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \u0027Boris Johnson is declaring victory before the war is over, in an attempt to distract from the police knocking at his door.\u0027Labour doesn\u0027t want to see restrictions in place any longer than they need to be.\u0027The Government should publish the evidence behind this decision, so the public can have faith that it is being made in the national interest.\u0027Now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay, when people are still being asked to behave responsibly.\u0027Meanwhile, No 10 sources stressed testing \u0027surveillance systems and contingency measures\u0027 would be retained for use if required.Downing Street said pharmaceutical interventions will \u0027continue to be our first line of defence\u0027, with the vaccine programme remaining \u0027open to anyone who has not yet come forward\u0027.With 85 per cent of the UK\u0027s population double-vaccinated, and 38million booster jabs administered, No 10 said it had concluded \u0027Government intervention in people\u0027s lives can now finally end\u0027.But it appeared to keep the door open to state-funded infection sampling remaining in place, following reports that Covid studies could be withdrawn as part of the plan.Officials said Monday\u0027s \u0027living with Covid\u0027 plan will maintain \u0027resilience against future variants with ongoing surveillance capabilities\u0027.It comes after senior statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter argued that the Office for National Statistics\u0027 Covid-19 study should remain in place in some form. The Cambridge University professor, who is a non-executive director for the ONS and chairman of the advisory board for the Covid Infection Survey, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme the results had been vital for monitoring people\u0027s behaviour.\u0027It has been absolutely so important as we have gone along,\u0027 he said on Saturday.\u0027It has been running since April 2020, and so, as I said, I do have a bias here but it is not just me -

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The State’s largest private hospital has said it “sincerely regrets” the upset caused to staff after they learned end-of-year bonuses had been paid to its finance team.Frontline healthcare workers at Dublin’s St Vincent’s Private Hospital were not covered by the bonus scheme, which saw finance staff receive €750 for meeting cash collection targets. Neither do they qualify for the Government’s €1,000 pandemic bonus for healthcare workers, which is ring-fenced for staff in public hospitals.In a letter to staff, seen by The , the hospital’s chief executive Nicky Jermyn said he wished to acknowledge the upset felt by staff over the payment to the finance team and added that the finance director “sincerely regrets the upset this has caused”.“I have brought this matter to the attention of the chairman of the board while I continue to gather detail regarding the payments made. I will be communicating with you further on this in due course.”A spokeswoman for St Vincent’s said the hospital had not paid a “pandemic-related” bonus payment to any staff. “The payment to the finance department relates to overtime and an incentive programme to achieve critical financial targets over a specific three-month period,” she said.PetitionSeparately, more than 500 staff in the hospital have signed a petition criticising their exclusion from the Government’s €1,000 pandemic bonus scheme.The staff say they feel “aggrieved, undervalued and disappointed” after the Government “chose to discriminate” against private hospital employees, despite the role they played during the pandemic.“Our private hospital played a pivotal role during the pandemic, as we protected the welfare of seriously ill public patients to free up public beds, as per the Government’s instructions,” according to the petition.The staff have called upon their respective unions to address the matter forthwith “in light of this injustice”.Mr Jermyn told staff that St Vincent’s University Hospital, which runs the public and private hospitals on the Dublin 4 site, had not received any payment to date in relation to the Government’s pandemic bonus. He said the Health Service Executive and Department of Health had not published any details on the qualifying criteria.In January, the Government announced its intention to pay the €1,000 bonus to frontline healthcare workers “in recognition of their work in dangerous and challenging conditions during the pandemic, and for the thousands of lives saved as a result of their efforts”.The payment will be made to staff in private nursing homes and hospices but not private hospitals. GPs, care assistants and other groups have criticised their exclusion from the payment.The department and the HSE are finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the payment, a department spokeswoman said, and details are to be published shortly.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus 2021 health service costs over budget by 640m","story":"A total of €133 million was set aside in Budget 2021 to fund the delivery of five million extra homecare package hours, but the actual spending is likely to be in the region of €45 million on 1.8 million additional hours. Photograph: Regis DuvignauCovid-19 costs in the health service ran up to €640 million over budget last year, but this was offset by significant underspending on recruitment and missing targets to increase hospital and homecare capacity.The Health Service Executive has provided the Department of Health with provisional financial information for last year, which is understood to project a total deficit of between €80 million and €140 million.A target to add 10,000 healthcare staff during the year was missed by a significant margin, with the final figure expected to be about 6,100.The reasons given for this are understood to include the impact of the Covid-19 surges and the demand for staff to work in the testing-and-tracing system and in vaccination centres.The Government has been told that the overspend of between €600 million and €640 million on Covid-19 matters has been offset by a €500 million underspend arising from slower recruitment, less elective care taking place due to the pandemic and the failure to meet targets to increase hospital capacity.Testing and tracingThe cost of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign came in some €430 million over budget, while the spend on testing and tracing was €270 million higher than expected. The spend on the hotel quarantine system and providing a grant for student nurses who worked during the pandemic added a further €70 million to the overspend, but personal protective equipment costs were expected to be some €100 million less than forecast.Given the fact that some €200 million was being spent every month on Covid-19 matters in the latter part of last year, there is understood to be concern about whether the level of pandemic funding allocated for this year, some €1 billion including contingency funds, will be sufficient.A number of Government departments are working together to establish their expected Covid-19 costs for 2022, and it is understood there will be discussions as part of this on the merits of continuing to provide PCR testing for free.Ministers are expected to be briefed this week on HSE spending, including an update on hospital bed capacity.Some €426 million was provided as part of Budget 2021 to fund 1,146 additional acute beds, 135 sub-acute beds, 66 critical care beds and 1,250 community beds. The actual spend, however, is likely to be about €247 million on 813 acute beds, 73 sub-acute beds , 42 critical care beds and 834 community beds.Recorded meetingsA total of €133 million was set aside in Budget 2021 to fund the delivery of five million extra homecare package hours, but the actual spending is likely to be in the region of €45 million on 1.8 million additional hours.The figures emerged amid a continuing controversy about recorded meetings of Department of Health officials discussing their concerns about missed HSE recruitment targets as well oversight of the €21 billion health budget. The information is the subject of a number of disclosures made by Shane Corr, a civil servant in the department.In a statement on Sunday, the department said it was aware of the alleged recordings, that no official gave their consent to be recorded and that publishing the details was “a direct violation of inidual privacy”.It said no recordings have been made available and it therefore could not say if they had been “doctored in any way”. “This makes it difficult to validate or respond constructively.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"reform of defamation laws to be brought to cabinet","story":"The report recommends the abolition of juries in High Court defamation cases. File photograph: GettyJudges will take into account attempts at mediation when deciding on damages payouts or redress in defamation cases as part of landmark reforms being brought to Cabinet this week.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is to seek Government approval to develop a Bill which would overhaul Ireland’s defamation laws on foot of a review of the 2009 Defamation Act.The report recommends the abolition of juries in High Court defamation cases, and says a judge should decide the level of redress, including the amount of any damages, as well as whether defamation has occurred.The report also recommends measures to stop powerful iniduals or entities from bringing vexatious legal proceedings to weaken or deter public interest discussion and investigative journalism.An “anti-SLAPP” mechanism would allow a person to apply to court for summary dismissal of defamation proceedings. A typical SLAPP – “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation” – is defined as a groundless or grossly exaggerated action which is often issued by wealthy companies or iniduals against weaker parties. The weaker parties may have engaged in criticism or debate that is uncomfortable to the litigant on an issue of public interest.Such proceedings are seen as being designed to censor, silence or intimidate critics by burdening them with deliberately high costs of legal defence. CompensationAnother recommendation would allow defendants to lodge a sum of money in court as a reasonable compensation offer when parties cannot agree on a damages amount.Under another recommendation the participation by a party in alternative dispute resolution processes would be among the factors to be considered by a judge in assessing the redress to be awarded in defamation proceedings.The reforms could also give powers to the court to dismiss a defamation claim that is not progressed within two years of being issued unless special circumstances justify the delay. This is in order to reduce a proliferation of stale claims.The report also recommends the introduction of a requirement for a court to be satisfied that Ireland is the most appropriate place for an action to be heard. This aims to address a perceived risk of international forum-shopping or “defamation tourism” into Ireland.A cap on damages in defamation cases is not being recommended due to this posing “difficult constitutional issues”.A general requirement to prove “serious harm” is also not being recommended except in two instances. In the first instance such a test could be available in cases of “transient defamation” such as when a comment is made in the course of providing or refusing retail services. There have been a number of defamation actions arising from allegations of shoplifting in recent years.In the second instance a corporate entity would not be able to sue for defamation of its reputation unless it first shows that the statement has caused or is likely to cause serious harm. In the case of a body that trades for profit this means serious financial loss. Consideration may also be given as to whether smaller entities such as small and medium enterprises should be exempted from this requirement. JournalismIreland’s restrictive defamation laws have long been criticised by the media as constraining investigative journalism.The industry group representing newspapers, Newsbrands, last year criticised the high level of awards paid out to plaintiffs who took defamation cases against media outlets, which were “far in excess of other jurisdictions”.The costly fallout from defamation cases was having a “profound impact on the financial viability of both national and local news publishers”, it said.The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders group, also known as Reporters sans Frontières , also said the lack of reform had helped to sustain “a prohibitive atmosphere for journalists reporting stories involving high-profile public figures and significant private interests”."},{"url":null,"title":"australia fully reopens borders to vaccinated visitors after two years","story":"A man with a stuffed koala toy and flowers at the arrival hall at the international terminal of Sydney Airport. Photograph: Brent LewinBloombergAustralia on Monday fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against the coronavirus after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings as tourists returned and hundreds of people were reunited with family and friends.More than 50 international flights will reach the country through the day, including 27 touching down in Sydney, its largest city, as the tourism and hospitality sectors look to rebuild after getting hammered by Covid-19 restrictions.“It is a very exciting day, one that I have been looking forward to for a long time, from the day that I first shut that border right at the start of the pandemic,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters in the island state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on tourism.After being away from loved ones for months there were many emotional reunions, including for Cindy Moss who travelled from the US state of Kentucky to see her daughter.“I just haven’t seen her in so long and it was such a big thing to be able to get over here. So I’m so excited,” she said after hugging her daughter, her voice cracking with emotion.Tourism is one of Australia’s biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion (€38 billion) and employing about 5 per cent of the country’s workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020.Once a champion of Covid-suppression strategy, Australia shifted away from its fortress-style controls and relentless lockdowns since late last year and began living with the virus after reaching higher vaccination levels. Skilled migrants, international students and backpackers have been allowed to fly into Australia since November in a staggered reopening exercise.PartyingPassengers flying to Sydney were greeted from the air with “Welcome Back World!” painted on a sign near the runways while people in kangaroo costumes welcomed travellers and a DJ played music from a van festooned with a banner saying “You were worth the wait”.“It is a party out here, music playing, smiles on people’s faces, they will be dancing soon, I’m sure,” tourism minister Dan Tehan told broadcaster ABC from Sydney airport as he gave travellers gift jars of Vegemite, an iconic Australian food spread, and stuffed koala toys.Tehan said he was hopeful for a “very strong” rebound in the tourism market, with Qantas looking to fly more than 14,000 passengers into Australia this week. Virgin Australia said it was seeing positive trends in domestic bookings and continued to assess demand for international flights.All trains in Sydney, meanwhile, were cancelled on Monday after pay disputes between the union and the state government, taking some shine off the reopening.As borders fully reopen, Australia’s outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant appears to have passed its peak with hospital admissions steadily falling over the past three weeks.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPAQueen Elizabeth is experiencing “mild cold like symptoms” after testing positive for Covid-19 but expects to be at her desk carrying out “light duties”, Buckingham Palace has said.Concerns for the queen (95) will be heightened given her age and recent health scare but it appears the head of state is determined to carry out what tasks she can despite contracting the virus.The diagnosis follows a string of Covid cases among Britain’s royal family and the queen’s Windsor Castle team, with the Prince of Wales meeting the monarch the week he tested positive, and the Duchess of Cornwall also isolating after contracting the virus.The announcement was made just a few weeks after Britain’s longest-reigning monarch reached her historic Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne on February 6th.Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “Buckingham Palace confirm that The Queen has today tested positive for Covid.“Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.“She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines.The royal household has its own royal physicians and the queen’s doctors will be on hand to take care of and monitor the head of state, with Professor Sir Huw Thomas, head of the medical household and physician to the queen, expected to be in charge.It is understood the queen is following Covid guidelines on self-isolating after testing positive but prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to repeal all pandemic regulations that restrict public freedoms in England when he lays out his vision for the future on Monday.The queen is believed to be triple vaccinated but until recently had been on doctors’ orders to rest since mid October, after cancelling a run of engagements and spending a night in hospital undergoing preliminary tests.Just a few weeks ago, the monarch had begun to resume her normal duties, hosting at Sandringham her largest reception in months, on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee anniversary, and a few days later held her first in-person audience with the prime minister in many weeks.The queen is believed to have spent time with Charles, Prince of Wales, on February 8, when he hosted an investiture at her Windsor Castle home, and a few days later he tested positive for Covid but made a quick recovery to full health.Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has also tested positive for Covid, with Clarence House confirming on February 14th that the duchess was self isolating. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm eunice storm dudley pictures havoc strong winds batter","story":"Dominic Good, surveys the damage after a 400-year-old oak tree uprooted by Storm Eunice fell onto his property in Stondon Massey, near Brentwood, EssexLiving with Covid plan: What rule-free Britain will look like after legal restrictions endComment: Unionists have fallen asleep at the wheelFour Russian false flags that are comically easy to debunkStorm Franklin: Thousands evacuated amid flooding in parts of the UK -

I see people wearing them outdoors, when walking alone, even in a 100mph gale – and two-thirds of Britons want restrictions to stay. So, here’s my question to Boris Johnson: how do you persuade a society that you have terrified and infantilised for two years that it is safe to go back into the water?We can protect you from death itself. A storm is treated not for what it is - weather - but the end of the world, government advice being to chain yourself to the heaviest object in the house and watch your live-stream of ITN journalists spinning off Brighton pier into the sea. Later I went for a nice walk. The man I encountered, gamely sweeping up the debris because “the council will never do it”, was the real hero of that day.There is a theory among some Conservatives that we need to let the public run their little simulation of socialism and see them learn the hard way that it doesn’t work, that taxes and inflation, and cultural stagnation, are the result. The downside is the wiser minority has to accompany them on this journey.Moreover, why should we have to endure this graceless slide into authoritarianism when we’ve got a Tory government with a large majority, supposedly on our side? The sheer passivity of the Conservative Party is a wonder to behold. They act as if problems are nothing to do with them (“the NHS is in a terrible state you know”) and robbing you to fix things is logical, even when, in the case of your energy bill, the state created said problem the first place and is now lending you your own money to fix it. Which we know it won’t.The “living with Covid strategy” will fail if it is limited purely to lifting the architecture of pandemic restrictions. Boris is going to have to use his talents to promote liberty, and call out organisations, from schools to supermarkets, that drag their feet on the road to reopening.

The whole emphasis on confidentiality shows scant respect for parents who are principal legal s.”A spokesman for the Scottish Government said the non-statutory guidance did not “in any way” conflict with legislation that set the age of consent at 16.He added: “The law continues to make clear that society does not encourage sexual intercourse in young people under 16.

We want to explore these untold stories and celebrate the people and places at the heart of our history.In 2020, a Historic England strategy document called for action to ensure a more erse range of people able to connect with, enjoy and benefit from the historic environment and said it aimed to target priority audiences from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds.Now it has devised new pilot grants that will highlight overlooked historic places, with a particular interest in recognising and celebrating working class histories.Projects funded by the grants could include conservation work, exhibitions, education programmes or community areas centred on historic sites such as old factories or railways.Historic England bosses are keen for projects to encourage volunteering and be community-led, allowing people to tell their own stories about their local areas.Nigel Huddleston, the heritage minister, backed the plans and said: Our heritage belongs to us all and should be accessible to everyone. I welcome plans for new community-led projects to tell the story of working people across the country, bringing our collective and shared history back to life.Historic England has previously worked to elevate sites linked to more everyday aspects of history. Salford Lads Club, an Edwardian club set up to keep young men off the streets, and the Byker Wall housing estate in Newcastle have recently been listed.A £93 million budget has also been allocated for the rejuvenation of historic high streets across England, including in traditionally working class areas such as Sunderland, Stoke-on-Trent and Grimsby.The deadline for applications for the everyday heritage grants is May 23.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow has compiled \u0026#39hit list\u0026#39 of iniduals to target after invasion, says USMonday morning UK news briefing: The Queen is not invulnerable, despite admirable stoicismBritish music entrepreneur and YouTube star Jamal Edwards dies aged 31Living with Covid plan: What rule-free Britain will look like after legal restrictions endFour Russian false flags that are comically easy to debunkUnionists have fallen asleep at the wheelMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jimi hendrixs handwritten lyrics tore apart 55 years ago pieced","story":"A page of Jimi Hendrix\u0027s handwritten lyrics have been pieced together after 55 years after being torn apart to provide autographs for British schoolgirls.Before a gig in Bath in 1967, the rock and roll icon was approached backstage by two teenage fans who asked for an autograph, but he had no paper to sign his name.Hendrix tore a page out of an exercise book used to scribble down his lyrics, ripped the paper in two, and signed both halves to provide an autograph each for the girls.The torn document spent 55 years in two pieces as the friends who saw Hendrix together drifted apart, but the girls preserved their respective fragments, and they have now been pierced together as memorabilia store Tracks prepares the piece for auctionTracks expert Paul Wane said the item was one of the “extremely few Jimi Hendrix manuscripts in existence”.On one side the fragment carries the signatures of Hendrix and the two other members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, and on the other the beginnings of a song.Headed “51st Wedding Anniversary” the handwritten lyrics also bear the note “Key of B”. Just weeks after Hendrix met the teenage fans, and despite tearing out his lyrics, 51st Anniversary was released as B-side to Purple Haze.One of the fans who approached Hendrix in 1967 contacted memorabilia experts Tracks about her half of the fragment, and the company managed to track down the owner of the other half, who had also preserved her memento from the gig five decades earlier.The repaired manuscript is now expected to achieve a five-figure sum at auctionHendrix was known to keep notebooks handy for his lyrics, and scribbled on hotel stationary and napkins when inspiration struck. The singer and guitarist wrote more than 100 songs before his death at 27 in 1970. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow has compiled \u0026#39hit list\u0026#39 of iniduals to target after invasion, says USMonday morning UK news briefing: The Queen is not invulnerable, despite admirable stoicismBritish music entrepreneur and YouTube star Jamal Edwards dies aged 31Living with Covid plan: What rule-free Britain will look like after legal restrictions endFour Russian false flags that are comically easy to debunkUnionists have fallen asleep at the wheelMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kremlin may not interested dialogue","story":"This matters because some European leaders remain of the view that a diplomatic settlement can be achieved.

We’re certainly not asking people to throw caution to the winds. Covid remains a dangerous disease, particularly if you haven’t been vaccinated.Blanket lockdown regulations will also be replaced by a requirement on local authorities to manage outbreaks through planning and pre-existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases.Mr Johnson said: I don’t want to go back to that kind of non-pharmaceutical intervention and want to be able to address the problems of the pandemic with a vaccine-led approach.But he refused to rule out reintroducing restrictions in the face of a new variant in the future. You’ve got to be humble in the face of nature, he said.Travel tests and red tape will remain despite the relaxation of domestic restrictions.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and pay for a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK.All travellers – jabbed and unjabbed – will also have to continue to fill in the passenger locator form (PLF) to enter the UK to the anger of many in the travel industry and Tory MPs who have campaigned for frictionless travel.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is expected to announce long-term plans for travel in the next month, which could see the PLF further streamlined, the scrapping of hotel quarantine for red list countries and measures to prevent a return to on-off border closures.Mr Shapps has been working with other countries to draw up a playbook of rules to deal with new virus strains so that action can be taken without shutting frontiers.He said that this will help us to ensure that, rather than having to shut down, we can put measures in place that are internationally agreed if required.Face masks are no longer compulsory except on the London Underground and other means of public transport in the capital. There is no legal obligation to wear them in shops.Instead, it will be left up to companies and iniduals to decide the approach they adopt, which means that companies, theatres and shops could still request that they should be worn by their employees and customers.A government source said it was likely we won\u0027t be explicit on the approach businesses should take to masks. They added: We are now in a world where we\u0027re moving away from Government diktat to personal judgement and responsibility.It is thought likely that ministers will still suggest that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces, where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet in order to minimise the risk of infection.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate with the Medical Research Council (MRC) at the University of Cambridge, urged vulnerable people to wear good quality surgical masks. Hospitals are still likely to limit visits as the Government’s new living with Covid plans will leave it up to inidual trusts to decide their own policies.More than a quarter of NHS trusts have suspended routine hospital visits completely, and in some cases relatives are being prevented from seeing non-Covid patients for weeks at a time.NHS England encourages trusts to facilitate visits wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way, but it is up to inidual trusts to set their own policies based on UK Health Security Agency guidelines.Analysis by The  found that at least 34 hospital trusts across England still have routine visits suspended, with exceptions such as those for patients receiving end-of-life care and people with dementia.All 125 trusts have some form of visiting restriction in place. The most common policy is to have one named visitor per patient for the entirety of a patient’s stay, who can only visit for one hour once a dayThe over-75s and those who are clinically vulnerable are expected to be given a fourth coronavirus jab within weeks.The elderly and those who have immuno-suppressant conditions will be offered another booster jab as it is six months since many had their third jab last autumn.Mr Johnson is expected to leave open the prospect that further Covid jabs could be given, saying he will be guided by the expert vaccine body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, chair of the JCVI, has said that fourth Covid jabs should not be offered until there is more evidence, as giving boosters to people every six months was not sustainable.In an interview with The  last month, he said the UK needed to target the vulnerable in future, rather than giving boosters to all over-12s.Mr Johnson repeated his plea for anyone who was not fully vaccinated to get their jab, saying Covid remained dangerous if you are vulnerable or not vaccinated. There are still people who have not been properly vaccinated or had their booster. There is no place for complacency about this, he said.Mass testing in schools is also expected to end at the beginning of April in tandem with the shift from the provision of universal free tests for Covid, saving the Treasury a significant slice from the current £2billion a month cost of the testing programme.It is understood ministers are considering contingency supplies of free tests for schools if they have Covid outbreaks. The requirement for face coverings to be worn in classrooms and communal areas was lifted last month as part of the updates to Plan B.But Mr Johnson faces a union backlash from Unison, Unite and the GMB, which represent school support staff, and they are urging him to keep in place free testing and the requirement to self-isolate.The three unions warned that the failure to provide clear, detailed guidance risked a “super spreader free-for-all” in schools and other workplaces. If remaining safety rules are axed, schools will be left in an “impossible situation”, the unions added.Parents will be unsure about whether to send their children into school, transmission rates could soar and new, more potent variants could emerge, they warned.More from NewsBritish music entrepreneur and YouTube star Jamal Edwards dies aged 31Four Russian false flags that are comically easy to debunkUnionists have fallen asleep at the wheelStorm Franklin: Thousands evacuated amid flooding in parts of the UK - latest updates When will free Covid lateral flow tests end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"storm franklin uk weather forecast latest news","story":"Storm Franklin batters the County Antrim coastline between Ballygally and Carnlough in BelfastUK hit by three named storms in a week for first time​How to stay safe when driving through flood waterBritain braces for 70mph winds Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes as Storm Franklin hit the UK overnight and caused at least one river to burst its banks.More than 400 households were told to evacuate in South Manchester amid two severe flood warnings, said the Environment Agency. In Sprotbrough, South Yorkshire, the River Don burst its banks on Sunday evening with the area\u0027s footpaths submerged.The River Severn also threatened to burst its banks with water drifting towards homes in Shropshire.Train operators have urged customers to avoid travel if possible on Monday as services in some parts of the country are expected to be paralysed by gale-force winds and lashing rain.This comes after the Met Office issued an amber wind warning for Northern Ireland and a milder yellow wind warning for much of the rest of the UK as Storm Franklin moves in.TransPennine Express (TPE) is strongly urging customers to avoid travel if possible, particularly those planning to travel north of Preston in Lancashire before 10am.The forecaster warned that the south of the country will be particularly hard-hit by stormy weather during the morning rush hour.​​Follow the latest updates belowAround 56,000 people were still without power on Sunday afternoon after Storm Eunice caused what energy providers believe was a record national outage over a 24-hour period, with around 1.4 million homes losing power.Ross Easton, director of external affairs at the Energy Networks Association, said Storm Franklin will hamper recovery efforts on Monday.We\u0027re still making pretty good progress in terms of reconnections, but it\u0027s certainly being hampered by the high winds, he said.Giving advice to those facing a fourth day without power, he added: First and foremost, check on friends, family, and neighbours to make sure they\u0027re safe and well, and if you have any concerns or need extra support, call your local network operator.South Yorkshire\u0027s Rotherham Central rail station in South Yorkshire has been closed due to flooding and remain so until at least Tuesday. The River Don burst its banks in the Sprotbrough area of Doncaster in South Yorkshire on Sunday night, and police have warned people to stay away from dangerous fast flowing water.South Yorkshire Police said: We ask people to remain away from the area of Sprotbrough Falls and Sprotbrough Lock in Doncaster, after the River Don burst its banks in this location earlier this evening.Many of the footpaths in this area are presently underwater.The water is fast flowing and poses a risk to people attempting to wade through it.Members of the public are being asked to remain away from the area at this time for their own safety.

The costly, long-running project was effectively left at a standstill after its strategic team was unexpectedly scrapped by a Commons body last week. Plans to bring a ‘business case’ for the work for MPs to vote on have been pushed from next Summer well into . And some sources believe the “Restoration and Renewal”project could end up being dissolved entirely, and replaced with a “patch and mend” process to fix the most serious problems with the building piecemeal over the course of  years. Sources close to the ‘Restoration and Renewal’project fear the crumbling Palace of Westminster could become another Notre Damedecisions are not taken soon.Parliament’s maze of lt shafts and corridors, run through with an ageing electrical system, means a fire could spread rapidly through the building in the same way as the -year-old Paris Cathedral.“There’s no sense of urgency,” one insider said. “It’s mad.”  And there’s concern the public might think proper restoration had already been underway for years while the Elizabeth Tower - which houses Big Ben - was under scaffolding. “That’s just maintenance really,” a source working on the RR project said. “They’ve done a lovely job on it, but the work that needs to be done to make the building safe is on another scale.”Traditionalist Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg has been accused of being a ‘road block’ to any plans to have MPs move out of the building during works - something he denies.It emerged this week that dozens of people had been warned they had been exposed to asbestos during maintenance work in the building. Over the last three years, authorities recorded  separate incidents of falling masonry on the estate - and there were  reported fires between  and . And in  the Commons Public Accounts Committee estimated the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining the crumbling building rose by £ million for every week the project has been delayed. In , MPs voted in favour of moving out of the building while work was underway, and the Sponsor Body was given the job of coming up with firm plans. But cost estimates spiralled to between £bn and £bn - with MPs set to be ejected from the building for more than a decade. The Commons Commission last yeardelayed the project, asking the Sponsor Body to ‘review’ it and come up with a way to keep a “sustained presence” of MPs during the refurb.  The review found even partial occupation of the Palace while work was underway would take “decades” longer, cost far more and involve an “extraordinary level of risk” to workers and people remaining on the premises.The review alone is reported to have cost between £m and £m to undertake. But rather than take the advice of the body, the Commission decided to scrap it and form a new body. Sources told the Mirror Jacob Rees-Mogg had been a ‘road block’ to plans to move out of the building while work is underway - and had “pushed back” on any option involving a ‘decant’. But a spokesperson for Mr Rees-Mogg denied this, saying it was not “fair or accurate.” The spokesperson said: “He was opposed to a scheme costing over £ billion and lasting  years with a  year decant, which is what has been proposed by the sponsor body. “Members originally voted for a decant of six years in . During his time as leader the house signicantly increased the pace of restoration.” He added: “Itaposs also inaccurate to describe him as a roadblock on the commission considering the fact the Government does not have a majority on there and he was far from the only person sceptical of an expansive [Restoration and Renewal programme] with a long decant.” Tory MP Mark Spencer, who replaced Mr Rees-Mogg as Commons Leader last month, has indicated he too has reservations about ‘decanting’ MPs and peers.Speaking to the BBC last week, he compared the idea to “moving out into a caravan in the garden and letting the builders loose.”The Commons Commission, made up of the Speaker, Commons leader and a handful of MPs and officials, decided to scrap the ‘arms-’ Sponsor Body last week - to be replaced by an as yet undecided body reporting directly to them and their counterparts in the House of Lords. Both the Commons and Lords Commissions are set to meet in the coming weeks to hammer out the next steps.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The ministry added: “The Home Secretary has already confirmed the Government is looking into whether creating a new offence specically on spiking would help the police and courts tackle the issue.” The Government has also rejected calls to make misogyny a hate crime - setting up a showdown with MPs.  The Home Office said: “The Law Commission has found that legislating to make misogyny a hate crime would in fact prove ‘more harmful than helpful’ to victims of violence against women and girls. “For example, prosecutors would need to prove a ‘hate crime’ occurred as part of another offence, such as rape, making it harder to prosecute sexual offences and domestic abuse.” Measures included in the Bill include increasing maximum sentences for child cruelty, extending Football Banning Orders to include online abuse and pardoning more people who were convicted of gay sex when it was illegal. Ms Patel has written to MPs pleading with them to back the legislation. She said: “This Bill is vitally important as we overhaul the criminal justice system and make our streets safer. “It must be passed soon so that we can continue to cut crime, reduce violence and protect women and girls.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: “Crime is rising, prosecutions are falling and there are still major steps that Labour is calling for to keep communities safe that Priti Patel is refusing to take.It is shameful that the Home Secretary is still refusing to make violence against women and girls a strategic policing requirement so it has the same prominence as tackling organised crime.” She added: Priti Patel is also still trying to criminalise people for protesting noisily or singing in the street rather than tackling serious crime. Too often under the Tories, criminals are getting away with it and victims are being let down.Peers inflicted a string of defeats on the Government last month over the controversial Bill, sending it back to the Commons as part of a process known as ping pong. It has been fiercely criticised for the draconian attempts to crack down on protests, in the wake of action from groups like Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. The Bill s to the Commons next Monday.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

Professor Andrew Pollard was a part of the team behind the development of the Oxford-Astrazeneca coronavirus vaccine.Despite the “overwhelmingly positive” reaction to him and his team, they have been forced to call the police after chilling threats from anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists.Speaking toThe Sun on Sunday , the professor revealed the drastic action he had been forced to take to ensure his own safety.He said: “We get a lot of negative correspondence from people, some of it threatening. “We’ve had extra security during the pandemic and we’ve had the police involvednecessary.  “There are regular discussions with them about potential threats. It is a little bit scary, but we are supported. He said he just had to “shrug off” the threats from extremists and has even faced issues on the cybersecurity side but has the full support of officers there as well. Despite the minority of negative and threatening correspondence, he said that most people had been incredibly positive and he had even been asked for autographs when out jogging. A lot of the positive correspondences have been from children as well, some of whom he hoped would become vaccine experts themselves.

He is now confident that the UK is in a totally dferent place to where it was back then and believes the country has reached the point where moving forward from restrictions is broadly the right path. Despite being largely positive about where the UK is now, he warned some people will still fall sick with the virus. He also warned that the country remains an ideal breeding ground for another, even deadlier pandemic.  The UK’s huge population, vast international travel, denser communities and increasing global encroachment on animals all lend themselves to another pandemic.One that could be even deadlier than Covid-.To help combat this he said the UK should help vaccine rollouts in countries where jab rates still lag behind the west. Thanks to vaccine hoarding, and also most citizens getting two or three jabs, huge swathes of western citizens have multiple jabs whilst many other humans do not have one.

But the little lad fell in love with the sea creature and convinced his family to travel five hours andit to the sea, BirminghamLive reports.The crustacean was found by -year-old Arthur Moon in the public loo at Birmingham Market. His mum Melanie says he quickly named the crab Gary, who they believe probably escaped from a live food stall, and was determined tohim to the ocean. So they took the cunning crab back to their Coventry home, kept him alive and plotted their trip to the beach.Despite being told by a stall owner that the crab would be dead in hours they didnapost give up hope and had a great day out. She cleared out a salad draw and made him a little habitat with sand and salt water - and the little critter went from strength to strength. The -year-old mum said: Arthur is autistic and doesnapost like crowds so we had been working on getting him out a bit more. He needed the toilet and went into the baby changing area by mistake. He came out and Iaposve never seen him so excitable! He grabbed my arm and made me go and have a look. There was a little crab legging it around the room and then he tried to hide in the corner.I thought, what should we do  He was smaller than my hand - and we decided to take him home. We went to a seafood stall and asked a woman for a pot but she said there was no point and he would die in hours. I thought better to die in our home then in a toilet at the market. I popped him in a pot then in my bag and went around the Think Tank. After taking him home, Melanie made Gary the crab his very own habitat in a salad drawer. I thought, aposI know, Iaposll get the salad drawer out of the fridgeapos, she said. I got sand from a bag in the garden in the bottom and then salted some water. After some googling I found out they will eat anything so I gave him some fruit. I found that his favourite things were tomatoes and strawberries. We think he was a shore crab which meant that he would have been caught in the wild rather than farmed.Melanie told BlackCountryLive: A few days later he was still alive and well and would watch me when I talked to him, he got quite used to me.He most definitely wasnapost dying - he had a real will to survive.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

So itaposs no wonder people want to know exactly how they did it for less than a grand. Samantha told money-saving Facebook group DIY On A Budget UK : We knew we wanted a dark kitchen as we got a dog last year and the mud and mess he brings back from walks would ruin a light coloured kitchen.“We came across a black kitchen in IKEA with aposwooden effectapos worktops and we fell in love with it.“On Facebook, I saw a lot of people were painting kitchen cupboards so I looked up the nearest store that sells the paint and had a chat with the woman in the store. “She told me what I needed and how to prepare the cupboards.  To prep the cupboards I just cleaned thoroughly with a sugar soap solution then lightly sanded them down before applying the first coat. I did about five coats per door, leaving them to dry in between. I then put the Frenchic finishing coat on top. The worktops I just cleaned down before applying the vinyl.“The vinyl I used was DC Fix which I ordered online from createyourworld as I couldnapost buy five-metre long rolls in-store, only online and I didnapost want a big join in the middle of the worktop. Samantha revealed the wall was created from two bits of wood costing £ each. She said: “For the black and white wall, I used two pieces of wood from BQ, which were £ each. I stuck them to the wall using No More Nails glue to get a perfectly straight line but also give a d effect which I like. I’m thinking of sticking another piece on the top to create a shelf effect and the wall is painted with Dulux in Rich Black at £. I did paint the skirtings in Frenchic Blackjack but as I hoover daily it did scratch so I have since gone over this in black gloss from Home Bargains for £ which so far hasnapost scratched.  Despite all this work, the couple still has more changes to make.Samantha added: “We arenapost finished yet! I still plan to change the blinds, add some more shelves, get some pictures for the frames and make it more personal and homely with some decorative items.With the leftover Blackjack paint, I did end up painting the radiator, the extractor fan and the wooden legs on the white unit which I think finished the kitchen off perfectly.The basket with the dogaposs toys in was originally blue but I got some spray paint from the pound shop to spray the inside of the radiator black that I couldnapost reach with a brush.  “Using the leftover spray paint I sprayed the dogaposs toy basket black. “The sugar soap solution by Frenchic cost £., then I used three tins of Frenchic Al Fresco in Blackjack at £. a tin. For the tiles, I used one tin of Frenchic Al Fresco in Dazzle Me for £. then I used Frenchicaposs finishing coat for £.. I used the Frenchic brushes to apply the paint. I bought a square one and the rounded one, which cost £. and £.. I personally preferred the rounded one. For the worktops, I used DC Fix vinyl in Santana Oak Lime which cost £. “The flooring was the only thing we didnapost do ourselves. “We got some laminate effect lino which was put down on top of the laminate that was already down.

Overall, the couple says they are proud to have knocked thousands off the cost of their refurbished kitchen. Samantha said: “A local carpet shop did that for us for £ but this goes through the hallway too. Overall it cost just under £ including the flooring. “I’ve heard of people quoted up to £, for a kitchen not as big as ours! As for tips, I would definitely recommend watching videos and doing research on everything beforehand. I didnapost research much with the vinyl and since fitting the vinyl I have seen videos of people doing it online and I could have made it so much easier had I have seen these beforehand. Use Pinterest for ideas, and Facebook groups are amazing for ideas, advice and help too. I didnapost do it on my own, it was a joint effort with me and my partner. “I wouldn’t want people getting the wrong idea and thinking I did it all on my own! Iaposm not that good. Itaposs taken us weeks to do it together in between working so on my own it would have taken forever. Iaposm over the moon with how itaposs turned out, it looks like a completely dferent kitchen and it was definitely worth the hard work! We feel really proud that we actually did it all ourselves.

The massive Volvo digger is stuck precariously sinking into the water, as police cordon the area off to prevent any accidents.As the country is battered by its third storm in the space of a week, Brits are more than used to blustery winds and torrential rain this February. This has included a record mph winds and conditions that tragically led to four deaths so far.Trains have been cancelled and countless damage done through debris and falling trees. Now, on top of that, new footage shows a massive digger and the  it was once on, stuck in the river. As the digger sank into the river, the surrounding  and all the equipment was stuck underwater too.  Riverbanks across the country have burst their banksapos thanks to the three successive storms that saw localised flooding across the UK. The footage, filmed on a drone, shows the destruction it has wrought in Leeds. It also shows a police presence around the area and all they can do is watch as the digger is beyond saving. The water rushes over it, through the cabin where a driver once sat.  River defences prevent the water from spilling out and bursting its banks thankfully as dozens of cars and buildings are only a few metres away. This all comes as Storm Franklin hit the UK on Sunday night and is forecast to remain through midday on Monday. Following on from Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice, Franklin is set to bring torrential rain and strong winds to parts of the UK. After red weather warnings which saw record mph winds and tragically five Brits die as a result, Franklin is set to be less disruptive than the previous two storms.The latest storm will affect the UK from midday Sunday into early afternoon Monday. Environment agencies have also issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the UK, including two severe warnings where rainfall could cause a danger to le for communities along the River Mersey in Greater Manchester.

Dr Kelly Fearnley, , has suffered violent shaking fits lasting up to  hours and terrying hallucinations after first contracting the virus on a Covid ward in November . At one point, the symptoms had taken such a toll on her physical and mental health that she considered suicide, she told Sky News.After  months of living with the long-term effects of the virus, Dr Fearnley believes Boris Johnsonaposs plan to peel back Covid measures is both dangerous and irresponsible. As part of the Living with Covid plan being unveiled tomorrow, Brits will no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive, and lateral flow tests will no longer be free.  Dr Fearnley, from Leeds, told Sky News she feels angry and let down about the plan, which she branded a strategy of denial, driven by the need to cut costs. Months after her initial infection, Dr Fearnley started experiencing violent shakes lasting up to  hours at a time. She also suffered from disturbing auditory hallucinations, chilling night terrors about death and debilitating attacks of pins and needles. After contracting the virus during the second wave, Dr Fearnley took four weeks off work to recover. But when she ed she immediately became dizzy and breathless and needed to go home, which was when she started experiencing the Long Covid symptoms.  The symptoms had an acute effect on her mental state, and she started experiencing auditory hallucinations, which included a man shouting at her in the kitchen and a dog barking beside her. She took herself to AE, where doctors said she was suffering from anxiety and sent her home. Dr Fearnley then started experiencing sleep apnea where she would suddenly stop breathing at night, accompanied by a sense of impending doom. By January , the doctor thought her symptoms were easing, but she was wrong. Every night for three months she suffered from more distressing hallucinations.  She was bombarded by imagined noises like a muffled TV, a radio, music, and heavy metal bands playing. During one upsetting night terror she recalled watching a group of men being lined up and executed.Dr Fearnleyaposs comments come before Boris Johnson announces a long-term plan to aposlive with Covidapos in England - despite hundreds of deaths a day.The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday.

After Bumbleaposs disappearance, Annie put out a missing dog appeal fearing her pooch might have climbed out when she was not there. But then suddenly Bumble popped her head up like a whac-a-mole on Tuesday, and she clambered to safety.The six-year-old dog had been missing in Rowde, Wilts since February . Heartwarmingly, Annie Davidson was then reunited with her pet. She said: Weaposre so delighted to have Bumble back home. The experience was traumatic for her. Bumble popped up and out of the badger sett. Very thin and dehydrated but fine otherwise.She earlier announced the dogaposs disappearance, saying: Border Terrier - Bumble - suspected to be lost down a badger sett. Dearly missed by all her family and especially her three young human brothers and sister. Lost pet group Search and Scan welcomed the news, saying: Welcome home Bumble. A spokesman added: Bumble was out on a routine walk when in a matter of seconds she just disappeared. Her owner could only assume she had disappeared down a hole in a badgeraposs sett that they were passing as she was nowhere to be seen. This was a very tricky case as by law badger setts are protected, so we were limited as to what we could do. Small dogs, particularly terrier type breeds are extremely inquisitive of mammal holes and will find themselves slipping easily through sett entrances and down badger tunnels whilst out walking off the lead. Watching your beloved pet disappearing into a badger sett can be very traumatic, not knowing whether the sett is occupied or whether your pet is stuck or worse! Badgers and their setts - tunnels and chambers where they live - are protected by law.

But eventually, she decided to tackle her huge debt head-on – which led to le-changing results for her and her familyKatie Agbebi paid off her debts of £, Image: INSTAGRAMByKate Graham:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Staring down at the huge number in front of me – an eye-watering £, – it felt unreal. How was it possible to owe so much  How could I have let it get this bad  Then I thought about the deliveries of clothes I’d hidden behind the sofa, the £, bed we’d bought on a payment plan, all the holidays we’d booked without a thought about how to pay for them…For a minute I felt completely overwhelmed. Then fight mode kicked in.“I’m going to face this head on,” I thought, determination flooding through me. Whatever we have to do, however long it takes, we’ll pay off this debt – and never get into it again.”I was  when I walked into my local bank in Liverpool and left with my first credit card. I hadn’t read the details and had no idea about the repayments. All I knew was that I could start shopping with “my” £ – result! I started my office administration job a few months later and my credit limit immediately jumped to £,. “It’s brilliant,” I said to my boyfriend, Marseilles, now , who I’d been with for a year. I was earning £, and still living at home with my parents. They covered all my utility bills so I could really splash out. Each month when the credit card bill came, I made the minimum repayment and then thought nothing of it. Marseilles and I never planned a baby so soon, but in  our son Marcus was born. I was besotted, but at  I felt the pressure as a young mum. I wanted to show everyone that I was doing well. Looking at Marcus in his pricey buggy and new clothes, I felt proud. “So whatit’s on credit ” I shrugged.  Spiralling out of controlLiving with my parents made the spending easy – ordering things from catalogues, I paid the minimum, just as I did with the credit cards. Then, in , the three of us moved intoa place of our own. “Look at these bills,” I’d think as they hit the mat. Rent, council tax, electricity – it never stopped.We decided I’d be in charge of family finances and I tried – but when it came to spending, I didn’t hold back. Why bother when I could just use credit  For years that’s what we did. When we bought a house in , family lent us the deposit, we used finance for the furniture and credit for the home improvements we needed. I lost track of what we owed. So long as I made the minimum repayments it felt fine. Our daughter Reyes was born in January  and we borrowed £, to get married in November that year. Yet the extra debt wasn’t a worry. The same year, Marseilles, who was a taxi driver, decided he wanted to study business at university. There was only one way to pay the £, fees. “Look, the loan has been approved,” I grinned, delighted. In January , I happened to see a YouTube video about setting financial goals, instead of New Year’s resolutions.“We must plan our next family holiday,” I thought. “I’m earning £, now and Marseilles is still doing taxi work. I wonderwe’ve any savings to go towards it ” I sat down and for the first time, calculated our monthly expenses. “This can’t be right,” I thought, fear creeping in. “The minimum repayment on our monthly debts is the same as my salary.” My dream of not ing to work after my maternity leave with Reyes vanished. But the upset I felt was nothing compared to the next shock. When I worked out we owed £, I was horried. “That’s impossible,” cried Marseilles when I told him. But as I showed him each of our debts, he knew it was real. We’d argued about money in the past. When our cable TV was cut off because the cash wasn’t there to pay for it, he’d been baffled and cross. I’d hide purchases from him to avoid fights. But in the face of this enormous debt, we united. The only way out of this mess was to be a team. There were only two ways to pay off the debt – increase our income and reduce spending. We focused on the latter. So, for the first time, I drew up a proper family budget. We went through months of bank statements with highlighter pens, looking at everything we were spending on. “We’re spending £ a month on food,” I spluttered. Out went my daily work lunch at the café and online food shopping. In came going to the supermarket in person with cash and a calculator and proper meal planning. Every penny counted. It would take time to get straight so we needed a realistic budget we could stick to. We decided to keep £ a month for takeaways.  Salon trips were over – I did my own hair and nails. Looking and feeling good was important, I just needed to do it cheaply. We swapped pricey theme parks for a National Trust membership. With the Lake District and North Wales nearby, taking a picnic and playing outside was just as much fun. We stopped buying any clothes that we didn’t need. Emptying my wardrobe looking for things to sell, I couldn’t believe how much I’d wasted over the years. For things we did need, like walking boots for Marcus, I hunted for bargains, thinking, “Can I get them from the ‘treat’ money this month ”We explained to Marcus, then , what was happening and he was amazing. He loved the visual debt trackers I’d made and stuck in the kitchen cupboards. Every time I made a cuppa, I saw the progress, which kept me motivated. I knew that I needed to be accountable, to keep me on track, so I created an Instagram account all about my debt and the steps I was taking to deal with it. Connecting with other people with similar experiences gave me a sense of community. But it was hard for real-le friends to understand why I wouldn’t have dinner and drinks out or why we were only buying Christmas gts for our own children and not theirs. People I connected with online understood because they advocated minimalism and “slow living”, too. The more unnecessary stuff we sold from the house, the lighter I felt. I started writing down all the things that made me feel good and realised my happiness came from family time, not buying things. So much of my previous spending was to look good and to “keep up”. I was discovering that I didn’t need that any more. For the things in my le that I didn’t like – such as our garden – I tried a “contentment challenge”. By really taking care of it, my feelings about it shted. Before, I’d have been shopping to change it, but I’d learnt that I didn’t need to spend to appreciate something. It wasn’t easy. While I celebrated the debt slowly decreasing, I was impatient. It was hard to be constantly reminded that it was my past mistakes that had led me here.  On the right track We thought hard about having a third child. Would it be madness when we were trying so hard to deal with the debt  But by  we knew that having another child didn’t have to be expensive. Saoirse arrived in January . There were no fancy clothes or hi-tech baby equipment – and it didn’t matter one bit. In October ,  months after we faced our debt head-on, I made our final payment.“We’ve done it,” I said to Marseilles, grinning. There was no lavish party to celebrate, justa cake from my mum and a big balloon that said, “We are debt free.”Through hard work and laser focus, I felt I’d achieved the impossible in  months. The experience has really changed me and my financial habits forever. But it’s about so much more than keeping to a budget. I’m pregnant again and this baby will be born into a debt-free family – one who knows that true happiness comes from each other and isn’t something you can buy.Follow Katie Agbebi on Instagram @how_to_eat_an_elephantRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The National TrustNew YearBabiesBanksPregnancyCouncil taxCredit cardsFamily holidaysTheme parksMaternity rightsChristmas dinnerChristmas shoppingChristmas partyDebt\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Prince Charles is rarely seen touching his we Camilla, and the Cambridges have strict aposon-dutyapos behaviour. But when Prince William tried a rare PDA during the coupleaposs appearance on Mary Berryaposs A Berry Royal Christmas back in  - it was well and truly shot down. In fact, some viewers described the moment as extremely awkward and said Kate recoiled from her husbandaposs touch - however others praised her for trying to keep things professional and trying to avoid stealing the show.The moment occurred as the couple sat down to speak to charity volunteers at a Christmas party, which was being catered by former Great British Bake Off judge Mary. Twitter users picked up on Kateaposs reaction to Williamaposs touch.One wrote: Awkward! Too awkward!! They should have cut it out. Another said Kate aposmoved with a quicknessapos after her husband reached out for her. A third person commented: Kate shaking off Williamaposs hand on her shoulder during #ABerryRoyalChristmas. One royal watcher said she reacts the same way when her mum touches her shoulder because it makes her feel uncomfortable. However, others insisted people had misinterpreted the behaviour. One fan tweeted: LOOK WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Kate is beautully content as William’s hand rests on her shoulder. FIRST William STARTS to remove his hand, AFTER Kate simply shts. Another person commented: I like the way they interact, it’s professional. I don’t want to see excessive hand holding and back rubbing. It’s awkward, like you’re intruding on a private moment. Another said: I think he tickled her back or shoulder. She did move but there were no dirty looks or even a facial reaction. Over the years Kate and William have shared some PDAs, which always delight fans. Their engagement and th anniversary official photos show them cuddling tightly together and looking lovingly into each others eyes.Behind-the-scenes photos from Williamaposs Earthshot Prize Ceremony show Kate placing her hand on her husbandaposs back, and she had her hand on his knee in their  Christmas card.When Meghan Markle joined the family, Prince Harry raised some eyebrows by taking a much less formal approach to joint engagements. They loved-up couple held hands throughout their outings and couldnapost keep their hands off each other.But the majority of people loved the intimacy of it, describing it as a refreshing approach to royal le and sharing their happiness.

Prince Charles and Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz have become joint subjects in a politan Police investigation after the Mahfouz donated £.million to the heiraposs charities, before receiving a CBE honour.The force announced last week that it was launching the probe to investigate whether the honour was awarded infor the cash. But the Prince of Wales youngest son had already distanced himself from Mahfouz amid cash for access concerns in , years before Charles accepted his generous donations. This weekend detectives were examining a letter sent to Mahfouz’s representatives by Michael Fawcett, Charles’s longest-standing confidant and the former head of the Prince’s Foundation, in which Fawcett said he would be “very happy” to back the Saudi’s nomination for an honour, The Times reports.Officers could also call in Clive Alderton, Charlesapos private secretary to understand whether the prince or Clarence House knew of these dealings between Fawcett and Mahfouz. The Duke of Sussex was  when he expressed major concerns about Mahfouz and distanced himself just two years before his father awarded the tycoon with a CBE at a private ceremony in Buckingham Palace. Charles, , had written to thank Mahfouz for his donations and visited him several times in both Britain and Saudi Arabia. But the future king says he has “no knowledge” of any trade-off between donations and honours and that Harry’s apparent concerns were never shared with him. Mahfouz has also denied any wrong-doing, while Fawcett, , Charles’s former valet, has been forced to quit his role at the Prince’s Foundation over the disclosures. Charity watchdogs in England and Scotland have launched a joint investigation. Scotland Yard began to look into the Prince of Walesapos relationship with Mahfouz after a piece in the Sunday Times last year raised concerns about their dealings.But the latest documents to be uncovered date back to  when Prince Harry was seeking donations to Sentebale, a charity which helps children with HIV in Lethoso, southern Africa.As charity co-founder, Harry had agreed to meet Mahfouz who was dangling a £ million donation offer. The donation was even drawn up in the draft charity accounts until Mahfouz suddenly announced a new apospreconditionapos of the offer. Mahfouz’s representative told Mark Dyer, a Sentebale trustee and former royal equerry known as Harry’s “second dad”, that he wanted Harry to fly to the Saudiaposs home and meet his family before the funds were transferred.  On May , , Dyer, , sent the representative an email expressing his concern: “Are we really saying thatPH [Prince Harry] commits to a trip to Saudi, Sentebale will receive the donation  “If that is the case I need to now brief the board as the accounts have all been revised and signed off on the back of receiving £m donation. “I am seeing PH today at Windsor I will brief him on the situation and seehe now wants to commit to a trip, but this certainly was not our understanding . . . it is starting to bring into question ‘cash-for-access’.” The same day, Mahfouz’s representative responded by insisting that the proposed Saudi visit had originally been mooted by Charles at the “CH meeting”, a gathering at Clarence House weeks earlier. On that occasion, Charles was said by the Saudiaposs representative to have encouraged the idea of Harry visiting the Arab kingdom. Harry appeared willing to do business with Mahfouz at the time and is even alleged to have joked: “Has father beaten me to it and got the money ” On June , , Dyer wrote back to Mahfouz’s fixer to say that he had spoken to the prince and had a “long chat” with his private secretary. Dyer said: “There is a concern and we have to be very careful going forward. At no stage have we committed to a visit, we discussed maybe in the future meeting privately for a weekend on a boat. “The POW [Prince of Wales] obviously mentioned it in passing conversation that does not mean PH comes next week. He is keen for his son to see that part of the world, but not next week. “What has now happened is a promise of a £m donation but it now comes with a commitment to a visit ... that was not my understanding.  “I then discussed with PH and quite rightly he has a major concern that we are losing [sic] touch with what all this is about ... it’s not about M [Mahfouz] meeting PH and introducing him to his friends and [Mahfouz’s adviser] having as many photos as possible of PH on his desk... itaposs [sic] about the children of Lesotho and Sentebale making a dference to their lives.” Dyer, who is a godfather to Harry’s son, Archie, continued: “There is a possibility of a visit to Saudi andthis happens PH will visit M, but to be held over a barrel, I think is wrong. “It would be a real shamethis falls through and I think we need to start again and remember the first meeting with PH. What is now on the table is very dferent.” Mahfouz continued to engage with Harry and gave at least £, to Sentebale. But neither the £million donation nor the visit to Saudi Arabia became a reality. Mahfouz instead increased his donations to charities connected to Charles after his aides made clear they would entertain the businessman’s desire for access. In October , Charles hosted Mahfouz for a weekend at Dumfries House, the royal residence in Ayrshire. In , they met at the British embassy in Riyadh and in  Charles gave Mahfouz his CBE at Buckingham Palace. The letter from Fawcett, now police evidence, shows that the donor was initially in line to receive an honorary OBE — but that the award was later upgraded. Following a discussion on July , , about potential donations worth up to £million, Fawcett wrote to Mahfouz’s representative: “With regard to supporting a nomination for an honorary OBE for His Excellency [Mahfouz], we would be very happy to send any such letter in due course outlining his philanthropy and ongoing generosity to the UK in heritage-led regeneration. “I will come back to you when I have discovered more about the necessary process that needs to be followed.” Fawcett is later alleged to have offered Mahfouz his backing to secure a knighthood and British citizenship, although these never transpired, The Times reports. Prince Charles has already spoken of his willingness to cooperate with the police. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours on the basis of donation to his charities.” Palace sources said Charles did not encourage Harry to visit Saudi Arabia. A spokeswoman for Harry declined to comment. Mahfouz has previously denied seeking any favours infor his donations. The Prince’s Foundation said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.

John Sam Jones, now , was an -year-old biology student at Aberystwyth University when his suicidal thoughts and shame over his sexuality became unbearable. He admitted himself to a psychiatric facility in Denbigh, Wales, hoping that gay aversion therapy would put a stop to his attraction to men, Wales Online reports.Doctors promised to cure him with the treatment, which involved being rigged him up to a power source and jolted when his body responded to gay pornography. Speaking from the Canary Islands, where he now lives with his partner Jupp, John told Wales Online: The psychiatrist was the first person I told I was gay. And the response was, aposOh we can cure that. We donapost have to treat the depression, we will just cure the homosexuality and then you wonapost be depressed anymore.apos  John likened the therapy to Ivan Pavlovaposs famous dog experiment. By repeatedly being given food while a bell rang, the dogs had been conditioned to salivate at the sound. The thinking at the hospital was that Johnaposs sexual attraction to men would endhe was repeatedly put through pain while watching gay pornography. I was wired up to a wristband that was attached to an electricity source, he says. I was shown homosexual pornography and when my penis responded, I was given electric shocks to the wristband. The procedure was administered by a doctor and two nurses. John was naked from the waist down as they monitored his response to the pornography. He felt like some kind of laboratory rat. John recalls being jolted about  to  times in each of the sessions, which lasted an hour to  minutes. He went through the excruciating therapy every day for about five weeks. He adds: It wasnapost changing my sexual orientation. It was actually closing my sexuality down. And although I didnapost know it at the time, for years I would have flashbacks to the electric shocks whenever I became sexually interested in anybody. Every few days I was asked whether I thought I might be more interested in women. And as a reward after the first few weeks of these electric shocks, I was shown pornography including women and not given an electric shock. Hundreds of patients were staying in the hospital, which John remembers as a huge Victorian palace of an asylum. The Grade II-listed site, which closed in , is now being redeveloped for housing. John recalls it being run like a village, with patients put to work on its farm. The patients did not talk to each other about their problems. Instead they discussed their occupational therapy, in which they made Basil Brush puppets from furry materials. We were all very drugged up with tranquillisers and antidepressants, says John. He recalls the language used by doctors at the hospital being very schoolboy. One doctor suggested John could go home for a weekend and find a woman to f***. This sparked an idea. He adds: I thought I could go away for the weekend, come back and say it had all worked and everything was fine. So thataposs what I did. They took me at my word and I was discharged.  Within days of being discharged I seriously tried to take my own le, because I realised that the treatment hadnapost worked. It felt like I was going to live le in the shadows. I wasnapost prepared to live like that. Thataposs when I told my family I was gay. And my motheraposs response was, aposWell, better a gay son than a dead son.apos And my fatheraposs response was to say nothing. John says neither of those reactions had much impact on how he felt. I was still living with my own self-hatred, he adds. You reach a point where you hate yourself so much, thereaposs nothing anybody can do to bring you back from that. He ed to the hospital for another month, this time with no aversion therapy. John recalls being left very quietly under lots of drugs. What I remember about that time is the goo at the side of my mouth that was created by the drugs I was taking, he adds. It seemed to thicken the saliva. I remember having long sessions with a psychologist who seemed very preoccupied with trying to discover whether any adults had sexually interfered with me. And I have never, ever had that experience. Much of the common mythology about what made people gay in those days was that you were groomed. For confidential support the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock  days a year on  .

But the mum says she could have saved herself years of trauma and the knowledge she would never fall pregnant again had she been screened earlier and caught the abnormal cells before they became cancerous. Following giving birth, she said the smear test was the last thing to be thinking about, but her partner encouraged her to go to the doctor. She said: As soon as I told them my symptoms, they screened me there and then and off the back of that I got a letter saying that they needed to see me. I didnapost say anything for hours afterwards.  “Not for one second did I think that would be the outcome. “It was like I was watching a soap opera. You think, ‘How’s that  I’m healthy, I’m a young woman’.” To fight the cancer, Naomi opted for a hysterectomy to remove her uterus and cervix but left her oies to allow an option for egg-freezing and surrogacy. But after the surgery, her condition took a drastic turn and she needed numerous blood transfusions, was admitted to intensive care with sepsis twice, and was then told cancer had spread to her lymph nodes. The brave mum underwent a five-week course of chemoradiotherapy which destroyed her oies and is now completely infertile. A new survey of , women commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Carefound embarrassment was the most common reason for not booking a screening appointment.  More than one in four women,who did not attend their smear listed this as the cause of their avoidance. Naomi said: I understand why people would be embarrassed but in the grand scheme of things would you rather be embarrassed for five minutes or go through what I went through  There will be girls out there who donapost have children yet - Iaposm fortunate that I already had Kyron. Nowadays there are so many things that they can do to stop you from getting to the point that I got to, but onlyyou catch it soon enough. Itaposs just five minutes and it can completely change your le. The most recent figures from March  show that nearly %t of eligible iniduals aged between  and , were not screened.In England, cervical screening is offered every three years on the NHS to people with a cervix between the ages of -and-a-half and . For those between the ages of  and , screening is offered every five years. Each year, around , women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and of those around  will die - this equates to two deaths every single day. The figures were released as part of a major national campaign to increase the number of those eligible attending their cervical screening in England. The campaign aposHelp Us Help You - Cervical Screening Saves Livesapos, was launched by the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Care.

The Duke of York agreed to shell out the monumental sum to avoid a court date after Virginia Giuffre claimed he trafficked and raped her while she was underage. The disgraced royal, who turned  yesterday, denies any wrongdoing and claims he has never met his accuser - who says they became acquainted through the Dukeaposs late paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein.Palace aides are said to have put a new spin on The Grand Old Duke of York, which references his denials at ever having met Ms Giuffre, reports the Sunday Times. They have been singing: The grand old Duke of York, he had  million quid.  He gave it to someone he’d never met, for something he never did. During his car crash interview with BBCaposs Emily Maitlis on Newsnight in , Andrew said he had no recollection of meeting the trafficking victim. This is despite a photo - believed to have been taken in London in  - in which he is seen with his arm around a then--year-old Ms Giuffre, as convicted trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell stands in the background.  The Duke has previously suggested the photo is a fake. Ms Gufre alleged Andrew had sex with her three times while she was a teen and underage in the eyes of US law. The royal told Ms Maitlis he didnapost regret his friendship with Epstein, and received a major backlash in light of the charges against the late financier.  But sources close to him have now told the Sunday Times there is genuine regret he was ever involved with Epstein. They added: He is remorseful, particularly about the impact it has had on his mother and his family. The same sources say the £million settlement figure is out by millions. It comes after claims Andrew has been making secret visits to the Queen at Windsor Castle every night by cover of darkness. He is understood to have been discussing the settlement as well as his future role within the Firm, having already been stripped of his titles and military affiliations amid the scandal.It is also reported Andrew has apologised to his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, as well as the Queen herself. Future king Prince Charles is said to have ordered his younger brother to avoid being photographed in public and could be ousted from Royal Lodge once he takes the throne.However, it is reported Andrew will make a public appearance at a thanksgiving service for his late dad Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey next month.It has not yet been decidedhe can attend the Queenaposs jubilee service at St Paulaposs Cathedral in June, as the monarch mulls over Andrewaposs future.

Itaposs the year sheaposll mark an incredible  years as monarch and celebrate her Platinum Jubilee.Plans had long been in place to host a spectacular celebration of her long reign during a bumper four-day bank holiday weekend in June. However,  has so far failed to live up to its promise of being a year of celebration for the Queen. In the past six weeks, Her Majestyaposs family have seemingly lurched from one crisis to the next - giving her a rotten start to the new year... Prince Andrew saga The scandal surrounding the Queenaposs son Prince Andrew has dominated the headlines for much of the first part of .Last year, Virginia Giuffre began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. The prince has always denied the allegations and said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her.As the case began to move towards a trial, last month the Queen decided to strip her second son of his prestigious honorary military titles and royal patronages. A source close to Andrew described the move at the time as leaving him “shell-shocked”.

However, earlier this week, that he had reached an out of court settlement, said to be worth £million, with his accuser Ms Giuffre, which means he will no longer face a civil jury trial over allegations.Last night, it was reported that the Queen agreed to help Andrew settle his civil sex case by personally making a £million donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity. Under the terms of the £m deal arranged by the Queen’s most senior advisors and the Duke of York’s legal team, the Queen agreed to help Andrew as long as she was not connected to any personal payment to Ms Giuffre, it is understood. A royal source said: “She could not be seen to be making a payment to a victim of sexual assault, who accused her son of being an abuser. “But a deal was structured in such a way to arrange a sizeable financial contribution to the settlement by way of a charitable donation instead. Covid scare Meanwhile, amid her son Andrewaposs legal woes, the Queen also faced a Covid- scare just last week.Last week, it was revealed that her oldest son Prince Charles had tested positive for Covid for a second time.It later emerged that just two days before his positive test, he had close contact with the Queen - sparking fears for her health. At the time, Buckingham Palace said Her Majesty had not been displaying any symptoms of Covid - but refused to sayshe had tested positive or negative for the virus. However, given the Queen carried out an in-person audience at Windsor Castle yesterday, it has been suggested that she may have escaped the virus. Prince Harry security row Another row that the Queen has had to contend with in recent weeks is her grandson Prince Harryaposs demands over security when he is in the UK. Last month, Harry released a statement saying he is unable to bring we Meghan Markle and their two children Archie and Lilibet to the UK due to a lack of security.He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so as Harry and Meghan lost their taxpayer-funded police protection when they stood down as working royals. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born - meaning she has never met the Queen.Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit. A source said at the time that the battle between the Queenaposs grandson and the government was the last thing she wants to get drawn into. Cash-for-honours Meanwhile, another blow for the Queen came on Wednesday, when it was announced that Scotland Yard had launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours scandal after Prince Charles’ aide was accused of promising to secure a knighthood for a Saudi donor.Last year a letter was published from , in which Michael Fawcett reportedly said he was willing to make an application to change Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouzaposs honorary CBE to a KBE. At the time he stood down as chief executive of The Princeaposs Foundation, while the charity investigated his actions. A spokesman for Prince Charles previously insisted he knew nothing about Mr Fawcettaposs alleged actions. Mobility issues  Last year, the Queen was pictured using a walking stick while attending a service at Westminster Abbey. And even though sheaposs only been seen a few times in public in , she has also used the stick.One of these occasions was on Wednesday during an in-person audience with military officials, where she talked about how she was having trouble moving. In footage of her audience, the monarch can be heard remarking loudly: “Oh. I’m here! I thought you might have just stayed in there for ages. Good morning.” Asked how she is, the smiling Queen, wearing a floral dress and holding a walking stick, points to her left leg or foot and responds: “Well as you can see I can’t move.” She is understood to have been feeling slightly stf, rather than having injured herself or being unwell. Sad deathAlso compounding the Queenaposs sad start to the year was the death of one of her close friends. In early January, it was confirmed that Ivor Herbert, a racing journalist and trainer, as well as a long-time friend of Her Majesty, has passed away aged .News of his death came just days after it was revealed that another of the Queenaposs closest friends, Lady Diana Farnham had died at the age of  just before the new year.Lady Farnham was the monarchaposs lady-in-waiting, acting as her Lady of the Bedchamber since .

After red weather warnings which saw record mph winds and tragically five Brits die as a result, Franklin is set to be less disruptive than the previous two storms. The latest storm will affect the UK from midday Sunday into early afternoon Monday. Environment agencies have also issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the UK, including two severe warnings where rainfall could cause a danger to le for communities along the River Mersey in Greater Manchester. Storm Dudley also hit parts of the UK last week and meteorologist Becky Mitchell said three named storms in such quick succession is a first since the system was introduced seven years ago.  She told the PA news agency: This is the first time we have had three named storms within a week, and we started the storm naming system in . At the moment weaposve got a really active jet stream, which is why weaposre seeing so many storms track right towards the UK. We had Dudley on Wednesday, Eunice on Friday and Franklin today.  Ms Mitchell said there will definitely be some impact from Storm Franklin but it is not expected to be as severe as Eunice because the strongest winds will be confined to the coast. On Sunday, all of Wales, Northern Ireland and much of the UK from Manchester southwards is covered by a yellow wind weather warning. The Met Office has said this could damage properties and cause power cuts as well as disrupt travel plans.The same parts of the country including the North West, East Midlands, West Midlands, South West, South East, and London will all see the same wind warning remain in place from midday Sunday to early afternoon Monday. Only the northeast will escape the effects of Storm Franklin, and winds of up to mph in coastal areas and mph inland in England and Wales. Then on Monday, an amber wind warning will be in place for northern areas of Northern Ireland. This means winds in excess of mph could be felt in coastal areas, with gusts up to mph inland. FORECASTED TIMINGS FOR STORM FRANKLINAccording to BBC Weather, the strongest gales will impact the following towns and cities beginning at these times: Derby - pm Leicester - pm Nottingham - pm Cambridge - pm Luton - pm Hertfordshire - pm Suffolk - pm Peterborough - London - pm Buckinghamshire - pm Brighton - pmSouthampton - pm Reading - pm Manchester - am Blackpool - pm Warrington - pm Bristol - pm Cornwall - pm Swindon - pm Plymouth - pm The worst of the weather will be felt late into Sunday night and early on Monday morning. Storm Franklin will move eastwards from north Scotland from early Monday morning but is expected to reach the North Sea and clear land before midday. The worst of the wind will be felt on the storm’s southern flank, but the high winds will continue to be felt for most of Monday. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page said: “Following the signicant impacts of Storm Eunice on Friday, Storm Franklin will bring further high winds for many late on Sunday and into Monday, although not on the same scale as Eunice.  “Coastal areas of Northern Ireland, especially on that north coast, will get the strongest wind gusts, which could be around mph in a few places. “Amber and yellow wind warnings have been issued, and people should remain cautious ahead of the system that will bring -mph wind gusts for much of the UK from late on Sunday and through Monday.” Snow is also a possibility in parts of Scotland and north England late Sunday into Monday, particularly on high ground.  RAC Breakdown Spokesman Rod Dennis said: “Drivers will be glad to see the back of Storm Eunice but it looks like conditions on the roads will remain challenging right through the weekend. With winds still strong and gusty, it’s important drivers don’t take any chances, so we urge them to slow down and leave plenty of space between themselves and the vehicle in front. “It’s not just strong winds that they’ll need to contend with – on Sunday intense rainfall becomes a feature making driving arduous. If conditions get particularly bad again, people should consider postponing their journeys, and for those who have to drive, it’s vital they keep their wits about them at all times.” People are advised to check their local resilience authorities for ongoing safety advice around travel and preparations.

A deep low-pressure system stretching across the UK from Greenland on an Atlantic “conveyor belt” will unleash mph gusts on Monday.The Met Office has also today named Storm Franklin, which comes with an amber weather warning issued for strong winds and heavy rain.The storm could bring brief tornadoes this afternoon as well as two inchesapos of snow in the North on Monday morning. Massive ft waves off north-west coasts have been shown on a weather map today.  Itaposs the first time since the naming system was introduced that several storms have come in such quick succession - with Dudley hitting on Wednesday and Eunice arriving on Friday. A second stormy system arrives while three further torments, each with mph gusts, are due on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. The North will be worst-hit, with the South buffeted as well. Three more storms are expected to be named in coming weeks – with a mad March of gales ahead. The Met Office warned of “severe gales possible almost anywhere” into March. The trio of torments would be named Gladys, Herman and Imani. The Met Office will name Storm Gladys when an Atlantic weather system has potential for amber warnings for wind, with rain or snow impacts also considered.  In recent daysapos battering from storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin is the first time three storms have been named by the Met Office in five days since forecasters began naming storms in . Government meteorologists are once again warning people in affected regions to take care, in the face of deadly winds. A Met Office forecaster said: “Monday has early snow crossing northern areas and gales. Tuesday to Thursday will be often windy, with a mix of rain, sleet and snow showers on Thursday. Gales or severe gales will be possible almost anywhere through the period to March , and especially in the North. “The first half of March is likely to be a continuation of changeable conditions, with winds remaining strong across the North and southern areas less windy.” The warnings come in the wake ofStorm Eunicewhich on Friday left a trail of destruction in the worst assault for decades.Sadly the storm saw four people lose their lives amid the turbulent impact of the gales. The cyclonic low, compared by experts to the Great Storm of , whipped up winds greater than mph as it tore through the nation. Storms this week threaten further damage to buildings, trees and structures weakened by Eunice. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: We are seeing a conveyor belt of lows coming in from the Atlantic. This was to be expected after the exceptionally calm January as the weather will always strive to bring a balance. Winds will be widespread on Monday when an Atlantic low from the weekend moves down the country.  A cold front on Tuesday will be associated with a low-pressure system to the north and this will bring some blustery conditions, and there is another on Thursday which will be one to watch. This week will be a case of ‘watch this space’ as further low-pressure systems are forecast to bring more wind and rain. Foul weather is being driven by a freakishly strong jet stream wedged over the UK and raging at mph. The core of the jet, the so-called jet streak, is propelling the band of air which circles the polar region, firing up storm systems as they pass over Britain.  Mr Dale said: These weather systems are being driven by the jet stream as will be the changes in temperature as it moves further north or dips south. Referring to Dudley, Eunice and Franklin, meteorologist Becky Mitchell said this is the first time the national forecaster has recorded three major storms in such quick succession since the naming system was introduced seven years ago. She told the PA: This is the first time we have had three named storms within a week, and we started the storm naming system in . At the moment weaposve got a really active jet stream, which is why weaposre seeing so many storms track right towards the UK. We had Dudley on Wednesday, Eunice on Friday and Franklin today. The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings where flooding is likely for locations mainly in the north and west of England, and  alerts where flooding is possible for the north-western half of the UK, London and the south coast, at the time of writing. Some  flood warnings and seven alerts have also been issued across the Scottish Borders, Ayrshire, Orkney and the Western Isles by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Natural Resources Wales has issued six flood warnings for areas just east of Shrewsbury, and  alerts covering much of the country.

She added: I do : because you know when itaposs bedtime, all of a sudden they need to use the bathroom, theyaposre thirsty, they want to say goodnight  times, you know the deal.

Most of the time. Ashleyaposs video has been viewed , times - and people have praised the mum as genius. One person said: Iaposm not a parent who lies to her kids, but this is not lying. This is genius tactics. While another added: This is the smartest thing ever. And a third said: Oh my god you have saved so many mums everywhere. Ashley even said the trick works once children have learned to tell the time themselves, as the key to the hack is to not tell your kids what time their bedtime really is. She wrote in the comments: My daughter is five and can also tell time. But since she doesn’t know bedtime is at  pm, she can’t say anything.

She added: Iaposm aware with the energy costs it might be more economical for them to run it through the night but Iaposm really struggling to get back to sleep once woken up at  am so can I ask them not to do this  Commenters on the Mumsnet post were split - with many saying they also put their washing machine on during the night so that their clothes are ready to be hung out to dry in the morning. One person said: I put my washing machine on a timer for  am so it’s freshly washed at  and I can put it on the airer before work. Could it be a similar situation  While another added: It’s tricky - I set my machine to be finished when I wake up. Means I can hang the washing out during the day and it’s dry when I get home. I’d be loathed to change that I’m afraid. And a third said: Itaposs probably on a timer so they are not awake when it goes on. I think itaposs really reasonable to go and speak to them in the day or evening. But others agreed that the noise would annoy them, and told the mum to speak to her landlordher neighbours were being unreasonable. Someone said: How frequently is this happening  I might tolerate it once a week but not more than that. I would try again to speak to them in person before putting a note through the door though.

Moscow’s troops amassed on Ukraine’s eastern flank now number over , – with tens of thousands more teamed up with Belarusian troops to the north.Warning about the apparent intention to invade, Boris Johnson said: “The plan we’re seeing is for something that could be the biggest war in Europe since .“All the signs are the plan has already in some senses begun.” Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said: “Everything we see indicates invasion is very, very, highly likely and very, very imminent.” Russia now has nearly % of its conventional forces threatening Ukraine, according to US intelligence analysis. Belarus suddenly announced yesterday that Vladimir Putin’s troops would remain in the country for exercises which are meant to have finished. Around  Russian warships are gathered in the Black Sea, threatening Ukraine’s southern coastline. Throughout the weekend pro-Russian separatists pounded civilian areas in the contested Donbas region with shells and mortar fire.It is feared Russia wants to provoke a major battle and use it as a ruse for invading the area under the pretence of protecting Kremlin-backed rebels. The military equipment daubed “Z” – which has increased fears of even more fighting along the front line of trenches – was between six and  miles from the border. In one case, some -plus military vehicles were seen around Bershakovo, Maksimovka, and Shebekino in the Belgorod region. The convoy included amphibious infantry fighting vehicles, mine clearing vehicles, howitzers and rocket launchers. Sometimes the “Z” – seemingly in Western lettering – is in a box.  Last year the Mirror revealed Russian troops had daubed tanks with “invasion stripes” – a white line intended to show them as friendly to other Moscow forces. In a new suspected stunt, the pro-Moscow rebel authority in Donetsk claimed to have seized a Ukrainian spy who was said to be confessing that Kyiv aims to overrun the Donbas. It is believed this is an attempt by Moscow to hit back at Western claims Russia wants to create a  flag pre-text attack for war. This would be by self-inflicting an attack and then reacting to it asit was by Ukrainian forces. Named Anton Matsanyuk, the so-called spy conveniently confirmed a plan touted in recent days by Russia of a Ukrainian plan to invade Donetsk and Luhansk. This detailed offensive plan, which fell into the hands of Donetsk intelligence officers, was broadcast by Russian TV.  Russia has extended military drills near Ukraine’s northern borders. Russian exercises, originally set to end on Sunday, brought a sizable contingent of forces to Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north. The presence of the Russian troops raised concern that they could be used to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The announcement came from the defence minister of Belarus, who said the two countries would “continue testing the response forces”. Russia held nuclear drills on Saturday as well as the conventional exercises in Belarus, and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the Black Sea. The US and many European countries have said for months that Russia is trying to create pretexts to invade. According to the latest US intelligence assessment, Russia now has close to % of its conventional forces threatening Ukraine.  The concentration of forces within striking distance of Ukraine is highly unusual and part of the reason the US believes Russia is ready to attack, an official has said. A RUSSIAN invasion of Ukraine could unleash Europe’s biggest conflict since the Second World War - and the opening phase may already have started, Boris Johnson warned yesterday. The Prime Minister feared Vladmir Putin might have already triggered his game plan for an attack. MPs are expected to debate the crisis today when Parliament s from the February half-term recess.“The plan that we’re seeing is for something that could be the biggest war in Europe since  just in terms of sheer scale,” the PM told the BBC yesterday.“All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun - that’s what our American friends think.” Western intelligence agencies have pointed to potential “ flag” attacks the Kremlin could stage and exploit as an excuse for going to war.  Over the weekend, blasts were heard in the disputed Donbas area of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian government forces for the past eight years in clashes that have left about , people dead. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for an immediate ceasefire in the region. Mr Johnson said: “You’re seeing these provocations now in the Donbas, you’re starting to see these explosions and so on that we have been warning about for some time.” The PM will be back in Parliament today after a week of shuttle diplomacy across Europe aimed at averting war. But the efforts have so far failed to curb Russian aggression - and Mr Johnson was forced to admit the threat of sanctions against iniduals linked to Putin’s regime may fail to thwart an invasion. What do you think  Have your say in our comments below  He admitted a joint venture by Britain and the US to prevent Russian state-linked firms from trading in pounds and dollars - a move he predicted would hit the Kremlin “very hard” - may “not be enough on its own”. Moscow has called for NATO forces to leave former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries in eastern Europe. But western nations are deploying extra troops to the region to counter Russian threats. The PM warned Mr Putin: “If he thinks he’s going to get less NATO as a result of this, he’s totally wrong. He’s going to get more NATO.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

But Mr Johnson added: “We have to accept at the moment that Vladimir Putin is possibly thinking illogically about this and doesn’t see the disaster ahead.” The U.S. embassy in Russia warned Americans last night to prepare evacuation plans. The grim warning cited the threat of attacks in Moscow and along the Russian border with Ukraine, drawing condemnation from Russian foreign ministry. “There have been threats of attacks against shopping centres, railway and metro stations, and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as in areas of heightened tension along the Russian border with Ukraine,” the embassy said. “Review your personal security plans,” the embassy said. “Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ukraine crisisUkraine protestsVladimir PutinRussiaCold War\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Armed forces experts said it mimicked UK and US tactics in the First Gulf War when forces sent to free Kuwait marked military vehicles with an upturned chevron.A military source in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv told The Sun : “It would suggest final preparations are complete.“It’s vital that any attacking force can be distinguished, particularly from the air where Russian forces will have complete control.  “The Ukrainians have very similar tanks and vehicles and will want to reduce the risk of friendly fire.” Video footage from near the Ukrainian border displayed markings on tanks, fuel trucks and supply vehicles. The military vehicle procession marked “Z” was estimated to be six and  miles from Ukraine as more than , troops ringed the country.Diplomatic sources in Kyiv told The Sun it was “widely understood” Vladamir Putin had decided to launch an invasion. Reports on social media yesterday showed video footage of the “Z” markings on vehicles. The vehicles were on the move as Russia broke a promise to withdraw its forces from northern neighbour Belarus after military exercises. Chief of Belarusian General Staff Alexander Volfovich denied such a pledge had been made and insisted the “exercise” had been extended until Monday. There are signs that plans to invade Ukraine had already begun as explosions were reported in Donetsk on Saturday night.Russia and Ukraine have been fragile since Kyiv began to grow closer to the West prompting Russia to annexe Crimea in . Firing has been reported across the region as Ukraine - while Russia and the separatists blame each other for the clashes. Artillery shells are said to have fallen within Russiaaposs borders, resulting in the death two of Ukrainian soldiers while explosions were reportedly heard throughout the Donbas. Mass evacuations of separatist groups happened on Friday as Ukraine was accused of planning an attack and alleging Kyiv plotted to blow up a chemical plant. Both countries have now, The Sun claims, shown the full mobilisation of their military forces.  Rising chaos in the Donbas, it is feared will be used as a pretext to move in Putinaposs troops. In a new stunt the pro-Moscow rebel authority in Donetsk claimed to have held a Ukrainian spy who confessed to plans to overrun the Donbas. Anton Matsanyuk “confirmed that Kyiv intends to use all its strike power in the forcible seizure of the Donbas, said a report. He confirmed a Ukrainian plan to invade Donetsk and Luhansk.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, warned Russia is planning the biggest war in Europe since  as Putin intends to invade and encircle Kyiv. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO chief said: Every indication indicates that Russia is planning a full-fledged attack against Ukraine. We all agree that the risk of an attack is very high. Johnson also told world leaders an invasion of Ukraine was looking increasingly likely and later said the attack appears to already be in motion. If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world, said the PM in a chilling warning during his speech at the Munich Security Conference.  Askedthe Russian leader had made up his mind to attack the capital city Kyiv, he told broadcasters: I think certainly things are in motion. But the question is whether it can all be pulled back and whether the President of Russia is still able to call this operation off. He added: Imagine the invasion of Ukraine, a country of  million people, the second biggest country in Europe geographically apart from Russia itself - an absolutely colossal place.  You canapost hold it down. There will be a protracted, violent, bloody insurgency with the loss of le for young Russians, as well as for Ukrainians.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left.

Preparatory work starts from February  to drop kerbs and improve access.Business access will remain open, with some delays as work takes place outside doorways.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience.

On Tuesday Gala demolished league leaders Bonnyrigg Rose with a comprehensive - victory in the East of Scotland Qualying Cup whilst Celtic B beat Vale of Leithen - at the Penny Cars Stadium last weekend.Celtic are able to field talented youngsters like the highly-rated Karamoko Dembele and Bosun Lawal who signed from Watford for an estimated £, and last-week’s hat trick hero Ben Summers.Assistant manager Steve Craig is under no illusion about the size of the task ahead but is confident that Gala are more than capable of matching the full-timers.Craig told us: Me and Jimmywill address the game exactly like we prepared for Bonnyrigg Rose on Tuesday. We want to win. We know how they will play and we will set out our stall. The last time we played them Jimmy can remember the tactics that hm and Neil Hastings put forward and we will do something similar. We just want to go and win the game and the game on Tuesday night just proves that we are more than capable of matching anybody in this league.“I think the fact that Celtic and Rangers are in the Lowland League is a great coup. They will bring supporters to the game and at this level the revenue is massive. I heard a rumour that Hearts might be putting a team in next year as well. So the case for having three Premier League teams gives our boys the chance to play against the likes of Dembele and players like that.After their - victory over Vale of Leithen Celtic boss Tommy McIntyre told Celtic TV: “Gala gave us a good game the last time we played them. I thought they looked to play a little bit of football. For us we always want to finish and score more goals and we want to do that so we will have to work hard in the final third.

Me and Jimmyran the show. \"Derek Adams was manager at the time and he had us so well drilled. Our game plan worked a treat.\"It was Neil Lennon’s first game in charge. Georgios Samaras and Aiden McGeady kept switching wings so we knew they were struggling. Robbie Keane was up front. I’ve watched the game two or three times right through.\"It was a bit of a stalemate then we scored after about - minutes then we kind of huffed and puffed a wee bit, but they never really asked any questions. Mickdidn’t really have to make any saves..remove“The break away in the th minute. We go down the right and Barradid brilliant to find Jimmy. It’s just great memories. You always want people to recognise the performance rather than just the result sometimes and our performance that day merited the win.“To score in the last five minutes and to beat the champions at the time - was a fantastic day. It was one of those days where everything clicked for us. My dadwas at the game and had a connection with Celtic and I just remember after the game looking up at the stand and I saw him and he was just standing with his hands in the air.”Scott added: “Stevie’s goal was unbelievable.

opponents stood firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar

In doing so, we are offering no mere conventional respect to a great public figure who has passed from us.#We did not think of George VI as a monarch living in high places, remote from the lives of the ordinary men and women of this realm.#Such was his le and character that his passing came as personal grief to everyone of his loyal subjects. We think today of a man who served us all with the highest and most self-sacricing sense of duty and probably beyond the limits of his strength – a man of complete integrity and of great personal courage and endurance.#His le exemplied the virtues on which, as we all know, the welfare of our nation depends. What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul

only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin internment, but below the average for a cremation.

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty

Nevertheless, the process also put data-driven decision-making front and centre of the public consciousness.Brian Hills, interim chief executive of The Data Lab, believes this is an important and often overlooked factor in the digital transformation taking place across the economy.“Every day we have been talking about data with governments giving out the latest statistics around Covid, so everybody starts to become familiar with ‘here’s the data, here’s the decisions being made’, and people have become accustomed to the use of data in helping organisations make decisions,” he explains. “It is a step-change that is going to continue.”Set up in  as part of Scotland’s network of innovation centres, The Data Lab is charged with driving growth of articial intelligenceand data science skills across the academic and business community.Mr Hills assumed the top role on an interim basis at the beginning of this year, and has his hat in the ring for the permanent appointment. He originally joined The Data Lab as head of product and data before advancing to deputy chief executive in June .: Ethics and values should be at forefront of decision-makingBorn in Glasgow and raised in the Highlands, Mr Hills began his career at what was then known as HP in South Queensferry in  after completing his master’s degree in computing at the University of Aberdeen. He later worked for nearly eight years at Sumerian, the Glasgow-based networked applications group founded by David Sibbald, and then joined travel search website Skyscanner in  where he created the Edinburgh-based firm’s business intelligence unit.From an initial team of , The Data Lab has grown to  people working across bases in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness. Its mission is to help Scotland “maximise value from data and lead the world to a data-powered future”.“For us fundamentally it’s about changing lives,” Mr Hills said.“How do we create the skills that enable people to have the careers they want to have in this area  How do we use data and collaboration across academia, industry and public sectors to innovate new products across ranges of dferent sectors ”Backed by government money provided through the Scottish Funding Council and Scottish Enterprise, The Data Lab also periodically receives one-off funding directly from the Scottish Government for specic projects. Examples include TORCH, which launched in  as a “matchmaking” service to help businesses with limited technical experience make better use of their data.: Data harvesting will reap climate rewardsOne of last year’s TORCH clients, Mercat Tours, decided to use the suspension of its Edinburgh walking tours during lockdown to consolidate its operations into a single IT system. The company also upskilled eight of its team members through the Data Skills for Work programme.“They saw that as a key competency that they need in their business going forward,” Mr Hills said. “Now they are a lot more operationally efficient and can scale up what they do as more visitors come back to Edinburgh.”As the acceleration of the digital transformation driven by the pandemic has pushed demand for data skills to unprecedented highs, the challenge for “’everybody in the ecosystem” is to not only train up the next generation but also unlock talent among existing workers.The Data Lab advises there are three key components to attracting new data employees: articulate a clear set of company values provide a straightforward explanation of the problems to be solved and outline the opportunities for professional growth and career advancement.“We also talk about the fourth alternative of upskilling people that are already in your company,” Mr Hills said. “It is quite expensive in time and money to go through a hiring process in a very competitive market, so can you take advantage of the ious upskilling schemes that are available to invest in your existing team ”There has been an increase in the number of firms taking up this fourth option, he said, but much more could still be done in this area. There has also been an uptick in the number of more mature workers retraining for data jobs in sectors such as healthcare because they believe it will have a materially positive effect on society.“We are seeing a trend that people want to pivot in their careers,” Mr Hills said. “I think people are taking a step back to see what they really want to do with their lives.“We are certainly seeing that in a lot of people who are mature in their careers – whatever you phrase mature as – who are really interested in making a change and doing something that they feel passionately about.”What countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why It has to be Canada – my we is Canadian so I have to be specic and say Nova Scotia. Amazing country and people, we can’t wait to get on the first direct flight from Glasgow in the summer.When you were a child, what was your ideal job  Why did it appeal Growing up in the Highlands, I spent most of my youth playing golf at Tain Golf Club and would have loved to have been a professional golfer – I couldn’t quite get down to single figures though. After a break of many years I rediscovered golf during the pandemic and enjoy it even more now.What was your biggest break in business I wouldn’t say there was one specic break. I’ve been fortunate to work with some of the best tech leaders in Scotland, from the early days at HP through to Sumerian, Skyscanner and of course, most recently, with Gillian Docherty at The Data Lab.What was your worst moment in business During the financial crash in a small business when people I’d worked closely with for a long time were made redundant. Now as a leader I know there is no easy way to do this, but it felt brutal.Who do you most admire and why After the past two years it has to be those who work in our health service.

He is a top manager and we’re all looking forward to working with him.“We all know the gaffer has done at a top job at St Mirren. I won’t say what he said, that’s between the team. We had our game plan for today and went over a few tactics and what-not.“On Monday morning, we will be in again. The gaffer will be taking us for training and we’ll be bang at it, ready to go again next weekend.“Any player is trying to prove themselves to everybody every week. It’s not just the case when a new gaffer comes in.“With the previous gaffer, too, everyone was trying to prove themselves. You have the fans, they come in their thousands. As a player and a professional, that’s your job at the end of the day.”Goodwin was notoriously a hardy player in his day, known for his combative style and determination in the middle of the park.He’s previously admitted himself that he tends to bring that passion as a manager on the touchline too, with his teams embodying that spirit.That is something McCrorie thinks will be beneficial to the Pittodrie outfit.He added: “I think that’s what we need. With the personnel we played today, we are all aggressive players. We know that.“We probably need more of it. We’ve still got more of that in the tank, to be more aggressive.“You need all your  players to be bang at it. You are not going to get results being nice.“That’s how I’ve grown up, you need to be aggressive and try and get the three points.”Meanwhile, Motherwell hero Kevin van Veen says there was no way he wanted to come off on Saturday despite suffering a painful shoulder injury.The Dutchman landed awkwardly on his right shoulder during the first-half. He was offered to be subbed by assistant Chris Lucketti, who was standing in for the suspended Graham Alexander.But the striker was determined to make the dference for his side yet again.While he may not have scored, his sheer strength saw off David Bates, to allow in Mark O’Hara to bag the equaliser.Satisfied with his contribution, he said: \"I landed on it and felt it straight away. Its a bit numb all over and I’ve been in a lot of pain. I didnt want to come off. I still wanted that chance.“It didnt come off with me but I had an involvement in the goal which was satisfying. But I wanted to win.\"When the ball came to me it was the adrenalin that got me through, as it was still sore. It got me through.\"Once the goal goes in I dont care how much pain Im in. Id rather have that and a bit pain than not have a goal and no pain. I dont really care about that.\"When you shoot you use your whole body, so it felt like I was pulling it all.\"Well see how it is when we assess it on Sunday or Monday. Its a bit swollen.

I would also like to assure you that the Scottish Government is pursuing every possible option to protect Scotlands position in Europe and, by extension, the interests of the people from across the European Union who live here,\" she said.Her letter was welcomed in EU circles.Last year the EUs ambassador to the UK Joao Vale de Almeida gave a message of appreciation to Ms Sturgeon for supporting European citizens in Scotland.And head of his visit Mr Trombetta last night thanked the Scottish Government for its help.“Three years after my first visit, I am delighted to finally have a chance toto Scotland. In the meantime, many things have changed: Covid and Brexit have been the big game changers in the le of all the Italians living in the UK,\" he said.\"While the pandemic seems to have eased its gauge on all of us, we are still dealing with the consequences of Brexit. This visit is an occasion to thank Scottish institutions for their support and collaboration in the registration campaign of EU citizens in the EU Settlement Scheme.\"In particular, we know we can rely on the attention of the Scottish Government in continuing to guarantee all rights, in all areas, of Italian citizens residing in Scotland and facilitate the regularization of the most vulnerable categories, the elderly, unaccompanied minors and the homeless.\"He added: \"It will be interesting to hear from the Scottish Government about the efforts and measures put in place to boost the economy and local development after the most intense peak of the Covid- pandemic. There is an interesting parallel to the latest Italian systemic reforms, powered by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.\"Italy is creating the conditions to make our south a new fertile ground for investment in five or ten years, based on an effective logistics network and a more favourable juridical and administrative environment. I deem we can share best practices on this and build together a new model for a more equal development throughout our countries. Scottish institutional funds may also look into these new investment opportunities in Italy.”His visit also comes as the First Minister prepares to hold a second independence referendum and campaign to take Scotland back into the EU as an independent country.In the meantime her government wants to extend its influence in the EU and has opened a series of headquarters in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin. A new office is to open this spring in Copenhagen.The ties are primarily focused on increasing business and trade opportunities but the Scottish Government also hope greater international engagement will lead to favourable opinion in Europe on Indyref and smooth access to joining the EU should Scotland become independent.Earlier this month Angus Robertson, the Scottish Constitution Secretary, referred to international reaction should the UK Government continue to oppose a second independence vote.\"The UK Government telling the people of Scotland what they can and cant do, that fundamentally changes the nature of the UK, will move the question on from being the challenge of independence to democracy itself,\" Robertson told BBCs Newsnight.\"And that will be viewed not just domestically but internationally as countries around the world will look at the UK and will see an entirely dferent state than they previously thought it was.\"There are currently just under , Italian citizens living in Scotland , an % increase compared to the numbers registered in  .Italians are the third largest EU community in Scotland .

Around  minutes later, Doyle-Hayes would get his second of the afternoon as he chested the ball and thumped it into the top corner from  yards in one fluid movement to seal the win for Hibs.Doyle-Hayes’ interventions lted his side to fourth in the table, broke the deadlock in what was a cagey encounter until that point and with Hearts losing to St Johnstone, cut the gap with his team’s rivals to nine points.It was a coming-of-age afternoon’s work for the -year-old Irishman, who was not shy of support at Easter Road on Saturday.“I genuinely don’t know where the goals came from,” Doyle-Hayes admitted. “I know I need to shoot more and I have had opportunities in the past and I have tried to play in other people in better positions. Sometimes I need to let it go and have a pop.“After the first one every time I touched the ball the crowd were shouting for me to shoot - even when I was on the halfway line. That’s why I thought I would have a go with the second one and it wasn’t a bad finish. Thankfully it came off and it went into the back of the net.“I had my fiancee in the stand and  boys from Ireland over for the game. So it was good to score in front of all of them. They weren’t over for a specic reason, they had some time off so they all wanted to come over and see me.”Doyle-Hayes’ brace arrived in timely fashion and he insists he and his team-mates haven’t given up hope of pipping Hearts to third place just yet. Hibs host league leaders Celtic in their next fixture and wile Doyle-Hayes reckons a victory will be a big ask, he believes the team are capable of building on Saturday’s victory.He added: “Can we close the gap on Hearts  We believe we can.“Before the game on Saturday we weren’t sitting in a great place in the table and as players we all knew that. We believe in what the gaffer wants us to do and we are taking everything on board. We know we are a talented squad and we can push on.“It’s a massive game next Sunday but we will get confidence from the Ross County game and we want to build on that. Celtic are a quality team with top players, so we know we need to stand up and fight for everything.“We have to stand up and earn the right to play our football and we know we can do it.”County striker Jordan White, meanwhile, was disappointed to leave Easter Road empty-handed, particularly as he believed that Doyle-Hayes’ opening goal shouldn’t have stood.Harry Paton rushed out to close down the Hibs midfielder but fell down following a coming-together with Hibernian’s Rocky Bushiri as Doyle-Hayes slammed the ball home.The manner of the defeat hurts, White concedes, but the forward believes he and his team-mates can take heart from their performance.“I think for their first goal there was a foul in the lead up to it,” he explained. “I didn’t see it myself but some of the boys were saying that it shouldn’t have counted as they thought it was a foul on Harry Paton.“It’s frustrating when that happens as we were still in the game at that point. The second one is a worldie from the boy but we shouldnt have let him be unmarked at the edge of our box. He has put it in the top corner and sometimes you have to take your hat off to him.“It probably shows how far we have come this season to come away from Easter Road disappointed.“We always believed we could go there and win the game. After the first half we felt we should have come away with three points. To be so disappointed shows the mentality we have in this group of players. But we have to pick ourselves up and go again now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Once we accept that, it is the first step to feel a certain freedom and to become better, that we don’t over-expect.“We should not expect too much about how big others see us andwe are the favourites against Lille, just accept it is a phase where things feel a bit tight and a bit more dficult than in other times.“We will accept it and this is the situation for the match on Tuesday. First of all we play at Stamford Bridge and we are confident to have a good performance because we deliver on a high level in knock-out matches, cup matches, Champions League matches.”A post shared by FIFA World Cup It was put to Tuchel that Lille will have extra preparation time after they were in Ligue  action on Friday but the German pointed out Cha’s travel on a weekend where Storm Eunice wreaked havoc were relatively favourable.“I think that Saturday to Tuesday evening for us as a home game and playing in London should not be a problem,” he added.“Sometimes it can cause a big advantagethere is a tight schedule.“But we will be ready to fight with Lille on an OK level so that should not be decisive.”Cha were without captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Callum Hudson-Odoi due to muscle problems which were sustained in training ahead of the trip across the capital.Tuchel revealed the duo could be fit for the midweek European encounter and also provided an update on fears when they visit Lille for the second leg on March  that any unvaccinated players in the Blues squad would be unable to enter France.“We try, we try make them fit for Tuesday,” the -year-old explained.“I think the rules at the moment allow us to travel with everybody and we need everybody.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s a very sad end to what was a very good story,” Doswell told Sky News.Both the Football Association and the Gambling Commission announced that they would carry out independent investigations into the publicity stunt and in September  Shaw was fined £ and banned for two months by the FA for breaching their betting rules.Sun Bets tweeted after the game they had paid out a “five-figure sum” on a bet that Shaw, then , would be shown eating a pie. Tabcorp, which owns the Sun Bets brand, was later fined £, by the Gambling Commission for offering the - odds.The goalkeeper, who also worked as a coach for the club, said after the game he “would give them a bit of banter”.Doswell confirmed both investigating bodies had been in touch with the club and said Shaw had made a “very genuine mistake” after being a big part of the media build-up to the cup-tie. vw,vw,px, px\"Sutton accepted Shaw’s resignation as the truth came to light “Of course we’ve been contacted by the FA, the betting commission, and it’s been a very sobering morning,” he said.“At the moment it’s early days and it’s by way of e-mails and other bits and pieces but unfortunately it’s worldwide news this morning.“It’s taken the gloss off my players’ performance and gone on to something it shouldn’t have gone on to. I feel very sorry for the players in many regards that that spotlight has been taken away from them.“It was an honest error but one that’s had quite sad ramications. Wayne’s been swept along with what’s happened in this last three or four weeks.“Since the camera got him in the Leeds United game he’s gone into another world in terms of what he’s used to.So Wayne Shaw, who slept on a sofa  nights a week at Sutton to maintain and run the place loses his job over #piegate. FFS!— Gary Lineker 💙February , “I think he’s been ill-advised at times and he’s just made a very genuine mistake. If you knew him, he’s such a lovely, lovely man. His judgement wasn’t great last night and he’s obviously paid the price for that.”Shaw found several allies in the controversy, including former England striker Gary Lineker, who tweeted: “So Wayne Shaw, who slept on a sofa  nights a week at Sutton to maintain and run the place loses his job over #piegate. FFS!“Day by day football is losing its heart and its sense of humour. #piegate”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

I was her son and I was also her friend, companion and chauffer.“We had meals out together or we would have taken trips to places like Portrush and Portballintrae.“She would say to me ‘I liked that wee place you took me to today, but it wasn’t as good as the last one’.”Hannah enjoyed seven years of good health after Robert’s passing, but Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. However, it wasn’t until she didn’t recognise her own home that he knew something was wrong.“That night sticks out a mile,” he said. “When mummy wanted to say something quietly she had this habit of giving you a nudge in the ribs. And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people

Credit: Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MLA Christopher Stalford. Credit: Peter MorrisonAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Prime Minister last night paid tribute to Christopher Stalford as a “a passionate and dedicated servant of the people of South Belfast”.Boris Johnson said he had been “very saddened to learn of the death of Christopher Stalford”, adding that his thoughts “are with the Stalford family at this very dficult time”.Earlier, a former SDLP councillor and friend of Mr Stalford from his student days at Queen’s University has paid a heartfelt tribute to the late DUP MLA.Writing on Facebook, former Derry councillor Mary Durkan said “there’s a special place in my heart for ‘Stalfie’ as I affectionately called him”. Our friendship forged at Queen#s University Belfast was an unlikely one. We came from very dferent backgrounds, had polar opposite views on certain issues, enjoyed very dferent student lestyles and moved in very dferent circles,” she wrote.“I can still see Christopher, suited and booted, giving his Student Council maiden speech in Queen#s University Students# Union in October . It was hard to believe he was just .”She said that during her term as Student’s Union President, ”what started off as calls to lodge complaints and express frustration about the Union evolved into friendly catch-up visits and cuppas in Cloisters. Christopher was brilliant company. He had me in stitches laughing without even trying. His apparently stern exterior belied his impish sense of fun and frivolity”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  She added: “We often disagreed. We challenged each other. We learned from each other. And, regardless of political viewpoints, we were never shy to admit our respect, admiration and fondness for each other.”Another political rival described him as “a man who worked tirelessly for his community and country” following his death aged just .Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said it was “absolutely tragic and shocking” news and will be felt by everyone who works at Stormont. “In addition to his duties as an MLA, Christopher Stalford was a Principal Deputy Speaker and his role was to ensure the smooth running of the business of the Chamber, which he did expertly and with good humour,” he said.“I worked with Christopher on many occasions and although we had dfering political views we never traded an angry word. He was someone I liked, respected and who worked tirelessly for his community and country.” Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill also spoke of her and her party’s “sincere sadness” at the news.“His we Laura and their four children are foremost in our thoughts and prayers this morning as they grieve the heartbreaking loss of a husband and father,” she said.“We have worked with Christopher over many years since he entered political le first as a city councillor, and then Assembly member for South Belfast.“His friends and colleagues throughout the world of politics will miss his political contribution, and his constituents his local efforts and leadership across South Belfast.” SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he knew Mr Stalford for more than  years and was “shocked” by the news. He paid tribute to “a decent and dedicated public servant”.Mr Eastwood postponed the SDLP Spring Conference following the news. He added: “Today is a day for political parties to set aside enmity and terse words and to remember that we are all people working hard and doing our best to serve the interests of the people we represent. Christopher Stalford was someone who did just that.”Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said, despite her politics being radically dferent from Mr Stalford’s, she had a “warm personal friendship” with him. “Just this week, we discussed his eldest child’s school transfer and it is dficult to put into words my shock, sadness and devastation just days later we are discussing his passing,” she said.TUV leader Jim Allister, who Mr Stalford had once worked for, said: “Words are not adequate to express the shock and deep sadness I feel at the death of Christopher Stalford.” Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyChristopher StalfordSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceBrandon LewisUlster Unionist PartyMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyChristopher Stalford’s death: A bright light has gone out in our party and in NI politics, says Sir Jeffrey PremiumAndrew MaddenOpinionThe Weekly Political Spin: From sectarian stadiums and poll denial, to temporary housing tourism and clumsy tweets PremiumSam McBrideOpinionMLAs cleared of ‘bullying’ top civil servant who complained after being asked #do you want to phone a friend # PremiumIt’s time to deliver the cash not more words, says former IFA president Jim Shaw who was promised funding in  PremiumUS firms axing plans to invest in NI because of Stormont crisisMost ReadPolitical rivals united in tribute as DUP MLA Christopher Stalforddies suddenlyUK’s most ‘prolic catfish’ is Newry student accused of killing American girl Suzanne BreenOpinionHow ironic the party of Paisley is haemorrhaging hardliners as DUP MP is booed at anti-protocol rallySam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...Dick and Angel Strawbridge: Underneath the ‘overnight success’ of Escape to the Chateau is decades of hard workTop VideosPlayDUP leader pays tribute to Christopher StalfordPlayDUP MLA Christopher Stalford dies suddenly aged PlayVideo: Cars collide on Glenshane Pass as heavy snow arrives with Storm EuniceLatest Northern IrelandTom McKibbin looks to push on after just missing out on first Tour winSpecial report: Crusaders want to turn Seaview into a multi-purpose stadiumDerry rapper Hyfin incredulous as film-makers chart his story for NetflixDerry firm Tobermore records % surge in pre-tax profits to £m‘Brutal’ punishment shooting of man in east Belfast is condemnedLatestBiden agrees in principle to meeting with PutinNewry City sitting pretty after closest rivals fail to win in ChampionshipTom McKibbin looks to push on after just missing out on first Tour winSpecial report: Crusaders want to turn Seaview into a multi-purpose stadiumRebecca Holloway: Everyone knows mental health is a big thing within sport and sometimes you have to take care of yourself and that’s what I was doing at the time,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_AC.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_DownHigh.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply. With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead. Indeed in the view of many people the road will have to go ahead.Another councillor has already suggested a dferent potential line which is understood to cut through part of the Down High School playing fields.CLOUGH ndash Clough Presbyterian Church Hall was built in , is being demolished to make way for a car park beside the new hall which is nearing completion.However, not all of the historic structure is being discarded. The original pitch pine rafters, Bangor Blue slates and main entrance doors have been kept.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September.

PA archive“And yet people’s understanding about plants, except in a very kind of narrow way, has not kept up with that. I think this will bring it home.”It’s a concept that the show’s executive producer Mike Gunton concurs with.“I wanted to do a Planet Earth for plants – because obviously your first thought with plants is, ‘It’s going to be like Gardeners’ World, it’s going to be dull’,” the Bafta-winning producer says, glancing over at Sir David as the broadcaster rehearses his lines.“Planet Earth, I think, gives you a sense that there’s going to be some drama and some scale. It is constructed by habitat, so I wanted to replicate that. There’s tropical worlds, desert worlds, water worlds, seasonal worlds, and human worlds.”Sir David Attenborough address the COP conference in Glasgow on November , As the first ever Creative Director of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, Gunton has played a pivotal role in the production of hit BBC documentaries including Planet Earth II, Dynasties and Africa.It’s a proven track record that sees him ideally placed to take on the mammoth challenge posed by The Green Planet. Reuniting with Dynasties series producer Rupert Barrington, the series – which premiered on the eve of November’s COP summit in Glasgow – saw Sir Davidto screens as series narrator.Sir David hopes people, after watching the series, will begin to understand the primordial importance plants play in human le.The veteran naturalist describes the world of plants as “a parallel world on which we depend, and which up to now we have largely ignored,I speak on behalf of urbanised man.”“Over half the population of the world according to the UN are urbanised, live in cities, only see cultivated plants and never see a wild community of plants. “But that wild community is there, outside urban circumstances normally, and we depend upon it. And we better jolly well care for it,” he warns.Recalling how the series proposal was met with the words “we’re ploughing a new furrow” from Sir David, Gunton says he knew the project needed to be an immersive viewing experience in order to capture the minds of viewers.“The green ecosystems are an incredibly strong web which underpins all le – and because it’s so complex and so strong, it’s an unchallengeable Jenga tower,” says Gunton. “What’s been happening is that we’ve been pulling the bricks out, but because we’re plant-blind, we haven’t really cared or noticed that we’ve pulled these bricks out.“As we know, with a Jenga tower,you just pull that last brick out, the whole thing collapses. “What we’re trying to say is, be more aware of those Jenga blocks, becauseyou knock down that tower, it’s curtains.”Noting the ever-present challenge of bringing the natural world to le, Gunton explains how the unit developed never-before-seen technology, resulting in a new approach to filmmaking.Based upon a widely-used technique known as time-lapse photography – a process by which a moving object is photographed consistently over a period of time and when played back, appears as a fast-forwarded video – the concept emerged after producer Paul Williams chanced upon a YouTube video uploaded by American visual engineer, Chris Field.Already a fan of botanical photography, Field had tinkered with existing electronics to create a customised camera capable of capturing the movement of plant le. Together with the BBC’s in-house team, they set about developing the technology in order to not only capture a simple time-lapse, but allow viewers to travel along the rainforest floor alongside plants and insects. It’s a project that also saw the Natural History Unit embrace drone technology – a more eco-friendly and immersive alternative to helicopters. Harnessing the skills of two competitive first-person-view drone pilots, the drones were able to weave through the rainforest canopy at high speed, capturing footage unlike anything previously seen.Recounting how the five year production saw the team – including Sir David, travel the world in search of exotic plant le, it’s clear that age is but a number to the veteran naturalist.“David is in his s, so we had to be quite careful about the number of locations and the amount of time away, but we managed to [go] to all the habitats,” says Gunton, listing off a swathe of trips across South America and Europe. “We’ve been to rainforests, deserts, water worlds, and the Arctic – we actually even went to the Arctic Circle.”The team also travelled to Costa Rica, visiting La Selva Biological Station – and what they saw there should bring hope, as the research centre has become famous for giving vast swathes of their land back to the natural rainforest.“Plants will rewire land for you, and that’s what David is saying,” says Gunton. “The planet heals itself, we just need to give it the chance to do it.”‘I’M SWANNING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT THE MOST FABULOUSLY INTERESTING THINGS’: A POTTED BIO OF SIR DAVIDSir David Attenborough was born on May ,  in Isleworth, Middlesex, and grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal.He is the middle of three sons his elder brother, Richard , became an actor and director, and his younger brother, John , was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo.Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones, and natural specimens. He spent much time in the grounds of the university. Aged around , he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered through his father to supply for d each. The source was a pond right next to the department. In , Sir David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owlat De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was: “Bowled over by the man’s determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. “The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave’s own credo to this day.”Sir David was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in  to study geology and zoology.In , he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In , Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Jane died in . Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology at a university in Canberra and his daughter Susan is a former primary school headmistress.Sir David had a pacemaker fitted in June , as well as a double knee replacement in . But the ebullient naturalist and broadcaster’s passion for what he does remains undimmed despite his formidable age.He is quoted as commenting in September : “If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop. But I’m not. “I’m swanning round the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things. “Such good fortune!”‘SURELY WORKING TOGETHER WE ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS PLANET’ SIR DAVID TOLD COP CONFERENCEAt the COP summit in Glasgow on November  last year, Sir David Attenborough called on world leaders and climate change activists to be “motivated by hope rather than fear” to avoid climate catastrophe.Speaking in front of an audience that included the US president, Joe Biden, at the conference’s opening ceremony, the broadcaster and naturalist said humanity was “already in trouble”.He also appealed to the political leaders and heads of state gathered for the two-week summit to commit to holding global temperature rises to .C above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two limits set out in the  Paris climate agreement.Sir David said: “Everything we have achieved in the last , years has been enabled because of the [climate] stability during this time.“The global temperature has not wavered over this period by more than either plus or minus one degree Celsius – until now. We are already in trouble. The stability we all depend on is breaking.“This story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today, those who have done the least to cause this problem are among those to be hardest hit. Ultimately, all of us will feel the impact, some of which is unavoidable.“Is this how our story is due to end “A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals ”He added his voice to increasingly growing calls for world leaders to thrash out a commitment to the .C temperature limit and called on young people to “rewrite our story”.“Perhaps the fact that the people most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generation but young people alive today, perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story.“To turn this tragedy into a triumph – we are after all the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. We now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse.“We must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air.”Attenborough also highlighted that “no nation has completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable”, and demanded “all nations have a good standard of living and a modest [carbon] footprint”.He concluded: “The people alive now and the generation to come will look at this conference and consider one thing – did the number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here  “There’s every reason to believe that the answer can be yes. “If working apart we are forces powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it.”The Green Planet is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The UK did get much of its early response badly wrong but then became a global leader in terms of vaccine development and rollout.Yet when there was a flow of articles in Ireland, or penned by Irish authors in UK papers, attacking London’s handling of the pandemic, there was no reaction in Britain.You might say this is a reflection of British arrogance, and that is partly true . But it is noticed in informed circles, where the lack of response is rooted in an intuitive understanding that Ireland can attack Britain but by goodness Britain can’t attack Ireland.ImagineIreland was perceived to be wrong on a major matter of public policy, and British commentators said so publicly and repeatedly in media on either side of the Irish Sea. I have never seen that happen, and do not expect to see it.Thus the truth is almost the opposite of the caricature: far from the UK believing in its greatness, it is full of self criticism, while it is Ireland that can act superior. Its president, Michael D Higgins, illustrates this double standard. It is often said that he has done much for reconciliation, which is true in that he has attended a range of ceremonies that show respect for all traditions, including the British and unionist ones. But he talks ashe has an entrenched belief in the historical moral goodness of Ireland and the wrongness of Britain. From time to time he wants to scold us about it.Observers this week, such as the artist Brian John Spencer, have pointed out how inappropriate it is that the head of state of a country which has a school system dominated by the Catholic church should lecture us in Northern Ireland on integrated education.If he was going to attack separate education in NI, why did he not single out the Catholic church for criticism  People talk about Catholic and Protestant schools but as far back as the s, when I was in class, many so-called Protestant schools were schools with a distant church origin that had long since become largely secular and mixed.Schools with a religiously mixed intake were somewhat atypical in that they tended to be grammar schools with many middle class pupils. Even so, it was a trend that has become marked with time. Some such ‘Protestant’ schools in greater Belfast have a : pupil mix.To this day few Catholic schools have that level of integration.Aside from the odd grumble, unionists or British people say little in response to the judgemental speeches from President Higgins.It is hard to imagine a British royal uttering any historical criticism of Ireland. Or even a UK cabinet minister doing so, let alone repeatedly making such speeches.Patience with President Higgins did briefly snap over the Armagh centenary service. An event that was made so neutral that it barely mentioned Northern Ireland, and certainly did not dare to celebrate it, was nonetheless too much of a recognition of NI for him.Yet his criticism over the years has kept coming: he turned down an invite to an RIC memorial he instructed unionists to be generous over  he said Britain must face up to its history of reprisals he accused Britain of feigned amnesia over imperialism of not treating the Irish as equals over the famine for its handling of an Indian mutiny.Here is a suggestion to President Higgins. If he is going to impart his views so freely, andhe is keen on reconciliation, then surprise us. Talk about Troubles statistics, and acknowledge the unionist wound, particularly in border areas, at the fact that republicans killed twice as many people as anyone , and often fled to a Republic that would not extradite them.If that is too stark a topic, then speak of the good things, such as the lingering British cultural and physical infrastructure in the Republic — the architecture or the system of laws and parliamentary democracy.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: Northern Ireland again escapes extreme weather as Storm Eunice passesOther opinion articles here:• Henry McDonald: Fans on both sides of ide agree that football stadiums are a disgrace• Lord Empey: It is right and proper that the victims of Bloody Friday terror are commemorated• Anna Faro: Big surge in empty pews just another problem for churches that were already struggling pre-pandemic• Ben Habib: This is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea border• Ruth Dudley Edwards: Doug Beattie’s engagement policy gets a boost from Alliance• Letter: The RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bomb"},{"url":null,"title":"christopher stalford was a true unionist but not a two dimensional ideologue ","story":"Ben Lowry: Surprise us President Higgins, say something nice about Britain   Breaking: DUP MLA Christopher Stalford dies aged NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionPeter Weir: My friend Christopher Stalford was a true unionist but not a two dimensional political ideologueI have known Christopher Stalford all of his adult le, and been his friend throughout.By Peter WeirMonday, st February , : amUpdated Monday, st February , : am  \"       \"  Christoper Stalford, left, and Peter Weir, right, at a Royal Black demonstration in . Picture by Brian LittleI first met him at Stormont in the late s, when he was still at school, and a frequent visitor to Stormont with his friend and constituency predecessor Mark Robinson MLA.As a student he was a bit of a political geek, with a depth of knowledge and analysis of local, national and international politics that belied his youth, equally at home discussing the latest developments in Washington or Westminster, as he was with Sandy Row or Stormont . As with many of us who were involved in politics from a young age, he initially came across as a bit square and we often joked that he started off middle aged and became younger with age.He came from a close and loving family, but was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and achieved his many successes through hard work and ability. Indeed, from early meetings his intelligence, talent and potential shone through, which was why as soon as I joined the DUP in , I headhunted him to work for me, first as a student, and then after graduation, becoming his first employer.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

High Sherf, Deputy Mayor and MLA filled me with pride but given his abilities no little surprise. When he became Principal Deputy Speaker he was filled with joy, not least because he knew the pleasure it would give his much loved family.Christopher was someone who cared about his city and his community. Although he moved house several times, it was always within Belfast itself. He was passionately committed to delivering for his constituents, and was a fearsome debater, who could deliver an argument with clarity, passion and wit. He was a true Unionist and Orangeman through and through, andyou had cut him in two he would have had DUP written through him like a stick of rock.He was not however a two dimensional political ideologue. Although he never swayed in his unionist convictions, his friendships and courtesy cut across the political spectrum. Indeed one of his sparring partners from Queens, Mary Durkan who became an SDLP Councillor in Londonderry, would be sure to ask me any time I met her “How is Stalfie doing ” The breadth of tributes paid to Christopher is a measure of the respect he engendered throughout the political world and beyond.Christopher was a Bon viveur and good company, a man with a wide hinterland of interests, and hidden depths as anyone who has heard him perform Sinatra in karaoke can testy. He was also a man of quiet, untrumpeted kindness. When my mother died a few months ago, knowing that I would be alone, he insisted that I spend Christmas Day with him and his family, That was the Christopher that lay behind the public image.Above all he was a devoted family man, who glowed with love and pride for his beloved we Laura and their four children. The country has lost a great representative, I have lost a great friend, but it is the loss of a husband, father, son and brother that will be most keenly felt and cruelly missed.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s a very sad end to what was a very good story,” Doswell told Sky News.Both the Football Association and the Gambling Commission announced that they would carry out independent investigations into the publicity stunt and in September  Shaw was fined £ and banned for two months by the FA for breaching their betting rules.Sun Bets tweeted after the game they had paid out a “five-figure sum” on a bet that Shaw, then , would be shown eating a pie.

It’s a club that is constantly giving back to people in this area and it’s important that we support them, particularly now with renewed opportunities for sport as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.”Read More Read MoreGAA friends raise £k in memory of SmickoCara HunterCauseway Coast  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularStorm Franklin: updated list of roads closed across Northern...NewsTributes to DUP MLA Christopher Stalford who has died aged ...NewsTobermore roads impassable as Moyola River bursts its banks...NewsMet Office issues yellow weather warning for all of Northern...NewsStorm Franklin: Met Office amber warning in place for Northe...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcfafcdfbaadebdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfadbdedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcfafcdfbaadebdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfadbdedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
