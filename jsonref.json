Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.A foundational work to start with. Aeschylus’ Oresteia has awed paulburns:I’m a bit overwhelmed by its brilliance, even though I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve read it. Translated by Robert Fagles, one marvels at its poetic grandeur and religious ritual, especially in Agamemnon, the first play of the cycle, Though that reaches a dramatic height with Agamemnon’s murder by Clytemnestra. The second play, The Libation Bearers, where Orestes decides to murder his mother in revenge for her murder of Agamemnon, moves more quickly, and, to my mind, reads better. The final play, The Eumenides, is the most frightening. Legend has it that the dance and chant where the Furies called down revenge on Orestes had women fainting in the audience. (I’d bet the men were shivering in their boots as well.) There was nothing to match it in world literature until Shakespeare wrote the witches’ scenes in Macbeth.Wow, I’m still a little discombobulated with that one, which is rarely a bad sign. The book didn’t really go at all how I expected it to. The direction of the narrative set in the first 50 or so pages preordained a certain finish, but the end was not what I had foreseen. Those closing pages really just knocked me on my ass ever so slightly.Millingabout is “deep into” Jerusalem by Alan Moore:It is apparently one of the longest novels ever written, which explains the tissue thin papers and small text. My god, is it good. Part anthropological dig into the residents of “The Boroughs” of Northampton, part historical fiction, part fantasy, and a deep delve into life, death and the afterlife that serves as the veins of the story. Jerusalem blends real life and fiction perfectly, it truly is Moore’s magnum opus. Out of all of the fascinating, mad, dark tales the author has given us, truly this is a story to rival Chaucer’s Tales. It feels like the type of story that should be broken up into parts and retold as folk tales for centuries to come. Highly recommended.An unusual experience for CCCubbon, when dipping into The World Turned Upside Down by Christopher Hill:This morning I dug out Hill’s excellent book on the radical ideas of groups such as Levellers, Seekers, Ranters, Diggers and Fifth Modernists, sects like Quakers, Baptists and Muggletonians … But here’s the strangest thing. Something I had not noticed before. This paperback was published by Penguin in 1991. I must have picked it up in some secondhand bookshop one day and I wanted to look up a reference to Sir Isaac Newton and his belief in alchemy, page 290, when I noticed that page 288 had a different typeface. Checking further, all the pages from 240 were in the same different typeface, in fact, after 240 the page number was 129. How odd. Investigating further, I discovered that a section from a different book was included (129-160) this is from Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins. Pages 240-288 of Hill’s book missing. I have never come across such a thing before and wonder if every 1991 edition has the same error?“I have read Old Filth by Jane Gardam,” says lonelybloomer “and I’m in love”:It is exactly the book I was looking for. What a treat to find there are two more in the trilogy! Feeling positively energised and happy with my reading habit.ChronicExpat has just finished The Hanged Man of Saint-Pholien by Georges Simenon (translated by Linda Coverdale):My, what a strange, surreal little book it is! As I read, I couldn’t help envisioning it as a black-and-white New Wave film, filled with shadowy lighting, rapid scene changes and long tracking shots… I am enjoying my initial forays into the world of Maigret very much. Given how many of them there are, of course, I shall have to pick up the pace if I intend to get through all of them: there are 73 novels left (not to mention the short stories) which, at my current rate of three a year, will take me another 24 years to get through … and I rather think I’ll be lucky to live that long.This week every year I take Ulysses down from the shelf and read three or four pages from each of the 18 chapters. It’s a ritual I enjoy more with each passing year and my admiration for Joyce’s masterpiece grows accordingly. Such a wonderful affirmation of words, of language, and ultimately, of our humanity. It is a novel that has never been bettered and I will be forever grateful to Joyce for completing it and to Sylvia Beach for publishing it.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

In a letter to Nicky Morgan, MP and chair of the Treasury select committee, Hargreaves’ chief executive Chris Hill also disclosed that 291,520 of the firm’s clients – or around one in four of its total customer base, were hit by Woodford’s decision to halt withdrawals from the £3.7bn flagship fund on 3 June. The suspension has left £1.6bn of Hargreaves’ client investments trapped for at least 28 days.Hargreaves has been criticised for promoting Woodford’s flagship fund on its Wealth 50 list of favourite investments, despite a series of bad market bets that led to a surge in redemptions and the fund’s eventual suspension.The investment group only removed the fund from the Wealth 50 when it was suspended. It has since tried to repair its reputation by apologising to investors and waiving its platform fee until the fund is reopened.Hill said Hargreaves had remained confident that Woodford would eventually deliver improved returns, given his successful track record over a near 30-year career that stretched back to a two-decade stint at Invesco.In the letter to Morgan, Hill said: “For the first two and a half years from launch the Woodford Equity Income fund was among the top performers in the sector, but by the end of 2016 the fund started to underperform. “We had seen the fund manager display similar underperformance in 1999, but then bouncing back strongly to 2003 and again underperforming in 2009, rallying strongly to 2016. We believed there was a reasonable expectation that he would do the same again.”Hill said the £41.1m fee would have been charged regardless of the fund its customers chose, and that commission earned from Woodford was handed back to clients through a “loyalty bonus”.Hargreaves explained that it had been in close contact with Woodford since November 2017, when it first raised concerns over the fund’s level of small and unlisted investments.Private company investments are illiquid, meaning they are harder to turn into cash to meet requests for withdrawals. A more liquid fund makes it easier to pay back investors if they decide to exit and reduces the likelihood of a suspension.Hill said Woodford assured the broker in November 2017 that he would not invest in any new unlisted stakes. In January 2018 the investment broker started having monthly discussions with Woodford about the unquoted stakes and, in April this year, Woodford told Hargreaves he would sell all of the fund’s private holdings entirely.“They did not inform us of this on either occasion,” Hill said.A Woodford spokesman said that it regularly supplies data to clients at the end of each month, and that both breaches were resolved by the time that data was due.“The agreement with Hargreaves Lansdown was to inform them of any month-end breaches only,” the spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a97c6598fb85dff20f42763871f9be4ff712d1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539805b8ad382c7778f4e2cb001dece1","title":"share your photos best worst cycling infrastructure","story":"Some cities feature spectacular bridges, bike paths and transport hubs designed with cyclists in mind, while others remain less than cycle-friendly.

In fact, Britain’s cycling commissioners have criticised the government for wasting hundreds of millions of pounds painting white lines on busy roads and calling them cycle lanes, which do nothing to make people feel safer on a bike.Chris Boardman, walking and cycling commissioner for Greater Manchester, said: “It’s tragic that hundreds of millions of pounds of government money has been spent on substandard cycling and walking infrastructure.”The commissioners are calling for an end to car-centric transport planning and a move towards investment decisions that “account for the true cost of car use to society”.In another blow to cyclists in the UK, Kensington and Chelsea council last week shelved a scheme to introduce new pedestrian crossings and install protected bike routes on a stretch of busy west London roads.We want to see your photos of examples of the best and worst cycling infrastructure in your cities.

The ones we met told us that alongside development goals such as eating solids and saying “Mama” and “Dada”, our child would be learning “British values”.One had an official Ofsted-approved British values “wheel” displayed on her wall, next to educational posters designed to teach shapes and colours. The wheel had a picture of a doe-eyed child in the centre, with green arrows radiating from the child to the values, written on a yellow disc. I asked her about this baffling graphic and she rolled her eyes. “Oh yes,” she said ruefully. “The British values. Got to have them.”This was the first I’d heard of “British values”. At first I assumed this must be an old, proud British tradition – it seemed like the only plausible reason to teach them to all children, including babies, as well as to label the innocuous, mundane sentiments on the childminders’ laminated printout as specifically “British”. But then I found out that this idea is barely five years old. In June 2014, the then-education secretary, Michael Gove, introduced them as part of the government’s response to the now discredited Trojan horse affair, in which Islamic extremists supposedly attempted to take over schools in Birmingham. The Trojan horse affair may have been a fake, but British values are apparently here to stay.The childminders we spoke to cared for up to six children at a time by themselves, or with one assistant, in their homes. These homes were spotless and orderly, run with precision and grace. Many of these women were migrants and mothers themselves. It seems like a farce to pretend that they should be responsible for making sure my baby isn’t being indoctrinated into extremist ideology or that he appreciates the rule of law.But then British values were not added to his curriculum because child education experts thought they were appropriate, or educationally sound – they were added because of fears of religiously motivated violence. My son is still working on learning to crawl, and on eating foods that are any texture other than a puree. He also has a tendency to pull plates off tables, bang his head against the wall, and try to roll off the changing table. I don’t want his childminders’ time wasted on remembering to impart vague propaganda when they have the extremely challenging responsibility of looking after other people’s children. Yet they risk losing their livelihoods if they don’t teach these notional values.To be clear, I do think my son should be taught morals and ethics as he gets older. I just don’t understand the need to pretend that the concepts he learns will be uniquely or especially “British”. I’m from the US, where we have plenty of talk in our schools about the greatness of our nation. I was often told to recite the pledge of allegiance, which claims the US offers “liberty and justice for all”, as well as adding that we’re a nation “under God”, despite our constitution’s separation of church and state.But as I grew older, I was also taught about the atrocities in our past, such as slavery and the Trail of Tears (the forced relocation of Native Americans). A dark-chapter-filled history is something the US has in common with Britain, with its legacy of colonialism and empire. And as he grows older, I want my son’s teachers and curriculum-designers to always bear in mind the mistakes of the past, not lionise the nation’s history into a narrative of nostalgic or nationalistic haze. My husband and I met childminders who migrated to Britain from Eritrea, Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone, all nations that suffered under European colonial rule. It seems particularly cruel to force people whose ancestors were brutalised by British colonists to indoctrinate children into the idea that “inidual liberty” is a fundamentally or uniquely British value.I want my son eventually to learn about British history, the good and the bad. I want him to learn about US history in the same way. And I hope his carer – we eventually chose the childminder from Côte d’Ivoire – will teach him about the country she was born in, and about her family’s traditions. That multiculturalism will go a lot further to demonstrate the inclusive, strong and respectful nature of Britain today than the force-feeding of “British values” ever could.• Amelia Granger is an American writer and former journalist living in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035207489c209678d4f90210950a74a431013c71/0_56_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73509b3b8dff546cb6d7d04cd0ac12b0","title":"female academics job applications men engineers","story":"Engineering has a huge impact on society. To responsibly advance science and technology, a university should be a balanced reflection of society. As a top engineering university we believe that ersity and inclusiveness is crucial for the quality of our teaching and research. More than that, we believe we can turn a fully representative academic workforce into a unique strength. This is why, from 1 July, all our job vacancies will be exclusively open to female candidates for the first six months after they are advertised.As a university devoted to engineering and technology we thrive on innovation to create the unimaginable, such as 3D-printed housing and living heart valves, and this means it is essential to embrace erse teams. There is overwhelming evidence that they are more creative and productive. Including different perspectives leads to better solutions. We simply need to tap the intellectual power of all genders.A university that is fully representative of society calls for an inclusive academic community. But the change we are embarking on will also have a favourable impact on the quality of our teaching and the varied perspectives that our students encounter. In recent years we have successfully attracted more female students, but now we need a culture change to enhance this further. More female staff will attract even more female students. More female professors will serve as role models and epitomise the values of the university.Again, this is not only a matter of fairness. In the Netherlands, as in many other European countries, there is a shortage of engineers. We simply can’t afford to exclude half the intellectual potential of our populations. Besides, engineering is a discipline that is all about brainpower, regardless of gender.The laws of the European Union allow us to favour women, given suitable competences, if they are seriously underrepresented. Smaller initiatives at universities in Delft and Groningen, which have been challenged in court, have shown that this is possible.• Frank Baaijens is rector of Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7a6a651580451abfbd57b9981e43a8ed973b0a/0_106_2165_1299/master/2165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b35bd48241cc1e8443fa39d683d9c16e","title":"margaret thatcher brexit tory folly 40 years conservatives","story":"Margaret Thatcher wrenched the party away from its pragmatic traditions. Brexit has turned it into a faith-based movement“I’d like to have led the Conservative party. I’d like to have been prime minister,” confessed a disappointed Conservative politician on Monday. It is proving to be that kind of week for the Tory combatants. Today it was Rory Stewart’s turn to come to terms with the dying of his national leadership dream, as Boris Johnson consolidated his grip on the Tory election in advance of today’s next rounds.But these words of regret did not come from Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock or any of the earlier fallers in this contest. Instead they were spoken this week by Michael Heseltine, in the final part of the BBC’s excellent five-part documentary, Thatcher: a Very British Revolution. It is what Heseltine said next that speaks most directly of all to the perhaps unsolvable problems facing today’s Tory party. If he had become prime minister, Heseltine said: “It would have been a different country.” He is right about that. But he didn’t. So it isn’t. And that is the Tory party’s problem.The scale of the crisis facing the Conservative party is not new, but it has never been more serious. It is 40 years since Margaret Thatcher arrived in Downing Street, and nearly 29 since Heseltine lost to John Major in the contest to succeed her in 1990. To many, these events will seem ancient history, noteworthy only for Thatcher’s historic status as Britain’s first female prime minister. But the Thatcher years continue to haunt the modern Tory party in malign and destructive ways, of which the BBC series was stuffed with rich examples. Theresa May’s prime ministerial calvary cannot be understood without them. Nor can the seemingly impossible options that will face her successor.Brexit may seem like the overriding problem for the Tories. But Brexit is the price the party is paying for the unchecked flowering of many of the poisonous political seeds planted under Thatcher. She inherited a party from Edward Heath that was not just pro-European. It also supported investment in jobs, wanted increases in social service budgets, and believed in regional policy – all issues with which Heseltine was strongly associated. She bequeathed a party to John Major that was increasingly anti-European, indifferent to regional policy, and which favoured tax cuts at the expense of public spending as a matter of dogma.The result – even three decades on – is a party that can barely conduct a sensible debate about anything, as the candidates proved this week. Nowhere is this more true than on public spending and the role of government. May tried to break this mould sometimes – it was one of her better instincts – but she never managed to persuade the party, Philip Hammond in particular, to do the same. Rory Stewart has stood out, until now, as he made the case for necessary taxation and spending, but only because what he says is so unusual now, even among liberal Tories, including of the Cameron-Osborne era. All the four surviving candidates have continued to act as though these realities do not even exist.It is hardly surprising that, following Tuesday’s candidates’ debate, Heseltine told Newsnight that he felt “disenfranchised” by the current process. He is right about that, too. That’s because his kind of pro-European and pro-government intervention Tory – the ’s late Hugo Young once described Heseltine as “Heath, but with children” – is simply withering on the vine. This process has been brutally accelerated by the party’s doctrinal obsession with Brexit. Same old Tories? Not a bit of it.A YouGov poll this week underscored the stunning scale of the reshaping, of which this election is both a symptom and a catalyst. Jeremy Hunt insisted several times in Tuesday’s TV debate that the Tories are the party of business and of the union. That may have been true a generation ago, but it is more than questionable now. By two to one, the poll found that Tory members would rather Brexit took place even if it meant significant damage to the economy, even if it meant Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, and even if it meant the loss of Northern Ireland, too. A large majority of Tories even think Brexit is more important than the survival of their party. Half of them would be happy for Nigel Farage to be their new leader.This represents an enormous shift of mentality that will not be easily reversed, even if the party was prepared to try. The Tory party used to have a practical reputation. A lot of this was exaggerated. The image was always a bit of a caricature. The Tories were always more open to ideas than they are given credit for. But the party rested on a platform of realism, too, a big example of which was Iain Macleod’s success in persuading the party not to re-privatise the National Health Service in the 1950s. By contrast, there is zero realism in a debate about Brexit between leadership candidates who have no idea how they are going to get a no-deal Brexit, which most voters do not want, through a parliament that does not want it either.The historian Robert Saunders wrote in the New Statesman last week that Brexit has hastened a closing of the Conservative mind. That is true. Yet not all of this is about Europe. A lot derives from a banalised, often tabloid-driven oversimplification of the wider Thatcher legacy – in which obdurate leadership, a mythic view of 1940, and anti-statism have joined anti-Europeanism as among its most toxic elements. The upshot is that the Tory party has become faith-based, not ideas-open. This has happened at precisely the time when civil society in Britain has made the opposite journey towards openness to ideas and away from dogma. For that reason, however, the Conservative party may now be beyond conserving.• Martin Kettle is a  associate editor and columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a05c01c489b7bd60f2d2696164e42a4b6fbe20/0_7_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7dc3456514fd92da9790e5dc4c35b33c","title":"guatemalans pay price west need nickel","story":"A vast European-owned mine is operating near Mayan villages, sparking a battle for survivalby  Juliette Garside in GuatemalaThe road to Guatemala’s biggest nickel mine is barely visible through a cloud of red dust, churned up by the 25-tonne trucks that thunder past loaded with ore.From the choking haze a cyclist emerges, weaving between the lorries. On his back he carries a bundle of firewood. Goggles protect his eyes, a bandana covers his nose and mouth.Manuel Choc, a grandfather with greying hair, lives in the settlement of El Paraíso, almost opposite the gates of the Fenix mine. Each bundle sells for 10 quetzals (£1). It is a precarious living.“Many people have died on the road,” says Choc. “The trucks run them over and often they don’t stop. Many people. Someone died just over there. The drivers, they do nothing. But God, he knows.”In many ways, the perilous roads are the least of his problems.Exporting its mineral to Europe and beyond, where it is used in mills producing stainless steel, Fenix is the focus of claims about water and air pollution, and fears of political corruption.As the quarries expand, hundreds of families in the surrounding Mayan villages fear eviction, and the loss of the environment that sustains them.In September 2011, Fenix was bought by the Solway group, a European-owned business run from Switzerland. Theirs is a messy business. Their diggers work night and day, felling trees and excavating 2.6m tonnes a year.On the shores of Lake Izabal, the country’s largest expanse of fresh water, furnaces pump out smoke seven days a week. The chimneys - fitted with filters designed to reduce impurities – are part of a plant restored by Solway. It turns ore into ferronickel.Dozens, sometimes hundreds of trucks a day carry ore and ferronickel away to the Caribbean port of Santo Tomás de Castilla.The once sleepy town of El Estor, with its pretty lakeside promenade, is now the focus of a vicious environmental dispute.The company’s arrival created 3,000 jobs. But it has also brought conflict.It is facing claims – which it denies – of being implicated in a news blackout after charges were filed by the public prosecutor, in a case brought by Solway, against two journalists working for the Guatemalan news website Prensa Comunitaria.Green Blood, a consortium of international media led by the French group Forbidden Stories, has come together to continue their investigation. Working alongside Prensa, El País, Le Monde and other media outlets, the  has uncovered new evidence that will raise fresh questions about the environmental impact of the mine.Guatemala’s supreme court ruled in February that local people had not been properly consulted when the Fenix licence was renewed in 2006, under previous owners. Solway is appealing. If the decision is upheld, it will have to undertake a listening exercise.Working with a translator, we spoke to villagers to hear their concerns. Many report similar problems: water shortages, problems growing crops, coughs, skin rashes and eye infections.To date, no scientific study has conclusively linked these problems to the activities of the mine. Solway says it is careful not to destroy water sources, and its own research shows the air quality has not deteriorated since Fenix reopened.But many people do not trust the company, or the few government studies that have been produced, believing the state is prepared to prioritise the needs of industry over their own.When the settlers of El Paraíso moved here, the mine, which dates to the 1970s, lay dormant. They struck a deal with the government’s land bank, Fondo de Tierras, put up their huts and planted corn.But their crops are now failing. First the plants were stunted now Choc says they die as seedlings. Choc blames the dust.Whirling in from the lorries churning up the road, and the open cast quarries, it falls on the roofs. Corrugated iron that should last up to 14 years is rusted through in four.Choc’s neighbours lift their children’s T-shirts and point to skin rashes on backs, necks and chests.This summer, the stream on which El Paraíso depends for drinking water ran dry.The people here have an expression: the mine, they say, is “eating the mountain”.With Solway planning to dig for the next two decades, the communities say they are in peril.Some don’t appear on any official maps. In the eyes of the authorities, they simply do not exist. Until recently, the Q’eqchi’ were largely internal migrants. Now they are joining the caravans. In December, a seven-year-old Q’eqchi’ girl died in the custody of US customs in El Paso, Texas.Stories of death and violence swirl around Fenix. In 2012, three students drowned at a nature reserve owned by Solway.Last week, the company’s biologist was found guilty of culpable homicide and his former employer ordered to pay reparations to the families. In 2016, when a boiler in the refinery exploded, seven employees were killed.Last year the head of El Gosen village was abducted and then jailed. During his absence, his people were evicted from land which Solway says they were squatting. The company offered them financial assistance to move.Tensions in El Estor escalated in March 2017, when a red stain spread across the lake. The fishermen blamed the refinery.Their unions decided to picket the road to Fenix. The trucks stopped rolling. Women and children were trapped inside the “colony”, a compound surrounded by a high wall where the mine workers live with their families.As the colony started to run out of food, and piles of untransported ore mounted, so did pressure on the local authorities to end the dispute. After a brief truce, negotiations fell apart and the protesters put up a new blockade.El Estor is still reeling from the actions that were taken next.Witnesses say that at 2pm on 27 May, police first launched teargas, then opened fire. The fisherman Carlos Maaz Coc had picked up a stone. He was shot in the chest before it left his hand. The police fled the scene, after wounding another demonstrator, leaving Maaz’s body on the tarmac.Instead of drawing back, the mine pressed the public prosecutor to take legal action against the demonstrators. The head of the fishermen’s union was eventually detained by police in Puerto Barrios prison. His deputy was held there for a year and is now on bail.Arrest warrants were issued for two indigenous journalists working for Prensa, Carlos Choc and Jerson Xitumul. Their names were added by the prosecutor to a list of fishermen accused of holding company staff captive. Choc went into hiding, and Xitumul was placed under house arrest. The case against Xitumul has since been dropped, and earlier this year, the prosecutor and the company asked for the charges against Choc to be dismissed, but the judge overseeing the case refused, requesting further investigations.And so it drags on.El Estor’s parish priest, who was three metres away from Maaz when he saw the police open fire, is horrified by events.“It is the modus operandi of many companies to impose fear, calling you a delinquent … and it seems that the strategy has worked for them,” says Padre Ernesto Rueda Moreno. “The union is completely overshadowed.”Among his parishioners, he says, there is “an almost complicit silence”.The company says it has a duty to protect its staff and their families, and that it does not seek to silence or harass journalists.A day after the shooting, the government held a press conference to announce that an algae bloom had turned the waters red. Its report blamed pollution from agriculture and sewage.But concerns about the refinery persist.A recent water analysis obtained by Prensa for this investigation raises fresh questions. Produced by Amasurli, the government-funded agency for the sustainable management of the Izabal basin, it concludes the lake is undergoing “eutrophication” – an excessive richness of nutrients leading to overgrowth of plant life.In 2018, nitrite salts were 54 times higher than the “regular” (safe) level, and phosphates were twice as high. The results for 2017, the year of the red stain, are missing. Amasurli’s explanation is that monitoring was “not realised” that year.What causes the eutrophication? The report concludes this is due to agriculture and sewage. Independent experts agree with this. A 2019 chart for 11 water quality monitoring stations shows the highest levels of nitrites and phosphates were found at the mouths of two canals that connect with the refinery.One is an entry canal, which takes water from the lake to cool the furnaces. The other is an exit canal, built to take water back to the lake.No one has an explanation for the results from the canals. Solway insists it does not use nitrites or phosphates in its processes. It says its exit canal has been closed since the refinery reopened in 2014.Nonetheless, Oswaldo Calderón, regional director for the environmental protection agency Fundaeco, remains concerned about Izabal and its wildlife. Manatees were once a common site in El Estor – they feature on the town council’s logo. Now, he says, they are moving away. He blames intensive farming, and the recent arrival of fish cages in the lake, which are introducing new chemicals like fertilisers. But he has concerns about the mine too.“The lake is really threatened. We have mining, bananas, sugar cane, and they have begun using it to farm fish. If this continues my fear is that it will become a swamp.”“If I could, I would just close the mine,” said Calderón. “This company is only bringing social conflict.”On the banks of the Trincheras River, a group of community mayors has gathered. They live at the foot of a second nickel mine owned by Solway, known as Montúfar.A canal draining rainwater from the quarries is pouring red earth into the river. The company says its tests indicate the presence of suspended solids – an indicator of water quality – does not exceed government limits.The mayors have a bigger concern: 7,000 people depend for their drinking water on cascades near where Solway is working. Over farming and deforestation are having an impact here. But communities continue to see the mine as part of the problem. “The waterfalls are slowly drying out,” says Mario Sandoval, mayor of Nehua. Since the rains began, he says, the number of litres per person per day has not risen from its summer low. “If the government don’t take this mine out of here, we are ready to put a stop to this. Soon they are going to be taking this side of the mountain away.”Back in El Estor, Q’eqchi’ leaders have gathered for their first meeting since the blockades. Juan Putal May, 52, lives in Semuc, inside the licence area. The principal spiritual guide of his village, he was born and raised here. In recent years, he has noticed changes. “Areas that were once humid and green are now dry and bare. It doesn’t rain as much. Agriculture, it’s over.”Ten years ago, a single “task” or plot would produce 30kg (70lb) of corn. Today it takes 16 plots to harvest the same quantity. Chili will no longer grow lemons shrivel on the tree.Families are leaving for the Petén region, further north. The dust is another issue: those left behind have skin rashes and sore eyes.Aníbal Coti, who runs the El Estor health centre, says conjunctivitis, bronchitis and asthma are on the rise. “Here, in the mornings, the dust begins to fall as if it were volcano sand,” says Coti. “It is regrettable the ministry of health does not pronounce on any of this.”Solway says Fenix takes every precaution not to impact the environment. The refinery chimneys are monitored to ensure the level of dust they expel remains within the legal limits.Dmitri Kudryakov runs the company’s operations in Guatemala.His foremen are young and bright, and seem enthusiastic about their work. In the corridor outside are football trophies from community matches.“When I came in 2012 the engineers could not enter certain communities, because they looked at us with caution,” he says. “Today there is no community that denies us entry. We can go to play a soccer game. We are invited to celebrate a wedding, Mother’s Day …”Asked whether the company has a plan to remedy water shortages, Kudryakov says rivers and streams fluctuate with “biological cycles”, just like the harvests. He says the mine is not to blame.“We have identified all the sources, in a zone of possible influence … and obviously we are not working near them. If necessary we plant trees additionally near the springs.”In the capital, Guatemala City, Luis Chang, the minister of energy and mines, points the finger at external factors. “I would ask what European countries are doing to halt climate change, which is one of the main conditioning factors in reducing the uptake of water sources.”He dismisses indigenous complaints as based on perception and rumour, rather than facts. The solution, he believes, is dialogue.Despite Kudryakov’s protestations, tensions remain high in El Estor. Recent weeks have seen sporadic blockades. At El Paraíso, Choc says he is staying put. “Until we die this is our home. We can’t leave. We will last until we last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

That moment caught the imagination of the journalist Bill McKibben, who has written and campaigned on climate breakdown ever since. And it has been reported that fossil fuel companies, such as ExxonMobil, were making links between the burning of oil and rising sea levels as early as the 1970s. But instead of making their findings public, the industry colluded to cast doubt over the science.

Here are 10 of the most memorable ...1953: Maggie Smith sings saucy songsSince the very beginning, the Fringe has been about catching tomorrow’s stars, today. And some of its earliest performers got very big, very quickly. Anyone who visited in 1953 and took in a sparsely attended revue called Cakes and Ale has presumably felt extremely smug about it for the rest of their lives. Why? Because singing three of the numbers in it was a young Maggie Smith, who used the contacts she made at the Fringe that year to help kickstart one of the most distinguished acting careers in history.1966: Tom Stoppard hits the big timeIf you’re looking for the ultimate Edinburgh Festival Fringe fairytale, then Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is it. A 29-year-old Tom Stoppard went up to the festival an unknown, and returned on his way to being one of the most famous playwrights ever. His head-spinning metatheatrical rewrite of Shakespeare’s Hamlet had been passed over by professional companies, and initial reviews of the Oxford Theatre Group’s student production at the Fringe were not kind. Then, boom: the Observer’s Ronald Bryden called it “the most brilliant debut by a young playwright since John Arden” and the legend was made.1976: Rowan Atkinson gets noticedFrom Stephen Fry to Emma Thompson, the number of Brit comedy legends who got their break at the Fringe in Oxbridge revues of the 70s and 80s is genuinely staggering. But 1976 was a particularly auspicious year: an electrical engineering student named Rowan Atkinson caused a tremendous stir when he came up with The Oxford Revue (which included his future Blackadder writer Richard Curtis), getting laughs from material in which there should have been no laughs. TV producer John Lloyd saw Atkinson and resolved to make him a star he succeeded.198889: Macbeth in the Firth of ForthThere are familiar Fringe venues, and every year there are the weird and wonderful one-offs. Perhaps the most audacious of these was Inchcolm, an island in the Firth of Forth, upon which artist and promoter Richard Demarco staged a full period dress production of Macbeth in the late 80s. It’s gone down as an iconic and provocative moment, and was reprised in 2012.1991: Graham Norton dresses as a very famous nunBefore Graham Norton was the reigning king of the comedy chat show, even prior to his breakthrough television role as Father Ted’s infuriating Father Noel Furlong, he began his career at the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe doing something … very odd. His drag show, Mother Teresa of Calcutta’s Grand Farewell Tour, saw the young Norton don a tea towel and perform cabaret in the persona of the renowned Indian-Albanian nun Mother Teresa, reimagined as an Irish housewife. You kind of had to be there, but the show’s mischievous humour has powered one of the most enduring careers in British and Irish comedy.1995: Jenny Eclair swears a lotMany performers became overnight sensations at the Fringe. Others had to wait a bit longer. Jenny Eclair was the first ever woman to win the comedy award – which she did on her 13th trip to the festival. It was a long time coming, but in the end it couldn’t have gone to anyone else: her aggressively in-yer-face, take-no-shit-from-anyone hit “Prozac and Tantrums” was swaggering 90s Britain incarnate.1997: The League of Gentlemen creep everyone outIn 1997 the three performing members of sketch troupe The League of Gentlemen – Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton – wore dinner jackets for the duration of their creepily original sketch show, and the horrors depicted within took place in a town called Spent, not Royston Vasey. In most other respects, though, they were the finished deal, and their subsequent rise was meteoric: they had a radio show later that year, and a hit TV show by 1999.2002: Jerry Springer – the Opera hits the right notesSome ideas are just so mad that you can’t really pitch them – you have to do them yourself and hope the world agrees with you. Richard Thomas and Stewart Lee’s Jerry Springer – the Opera was an obscenity- and blasphemy-filled actual opera based upon the pugilistic US chat show. It was a completely bizarre idea, but Edinburgh audiences got it: it was snapped up by the National Theatre straight after.2002: Nancy Sinatra plays her first ever British concertThe Fringe is more than just comedians and theatre: it also features a lively musical programme. Perhaps the most iconic performer to make her UK debut there was Nancy Sinatra: having failed to stage a single British concert during the 20th century, she finally played our sceptred isle at the age of 62, dressed head-to-toe in gold lamé.2012: Eddie Izzard invites some guy called Trevor Noah overIn 2012, Eddie Izzard was evangelising about a slick, original South African stand-up named Trevor Noah whom he’d adopted as his protege and brought to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Noah’s The Racist was a brilliantly original consideration of growing up mixed race in apartheid South Africa. Three years later, he dropped in on the Fringe again, just before he headed off to global fame as the new host of The Daily Show.To find out more about the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe – and how to make the most of your time there – head to edfringe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f338cd39db84dcf1b097820407c9d85930b4188/0_342_5127_3076/master/5127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c8804476b1894a7681d1dc9d0cd1644","title":"could banning sunscreens to save coral do more harm than good","story":"Hawaii, Mexico and Palau are encouraging tourists to use reef-friendly lotions – but protecting ourselves from the sun shouldn’t fall by the waysideLast year, the Pacific nation of Palau announced that, from 2020, it will ban sunscreens containing certain chemicals linked with coral degradation. Tourists will have offending suncreams confiscated and anyone importing them will face a $1,000 (£800) fine. In addition, Hawaii’s ban on sunscreens that contain oxybenzone or octinoxate – the two most controversial chemical compounds – comes into force in 2021, and tourists swimming at certain beauty spots in Mexico are already forbidden from wearing non-biodegradable sunscreens.If it all sounds pretty serious, that’s because it is. Sunscreen is supposed to be an entirely good thing. Having been a holiday essential since we learned about the damaging effects of UVB – and, later, UVA – rays last century, it is the stuff of nostalgia, adventure and longed-for escapes to warmer climes. News that the coconut-scented creams we have been slathering on for protection could be toxic to the environment is as welcome as a seven-day rainy forecast. So where do we stand with it as we head into summer?First, the basics. Sunscreens fall into two categories. Chemical sunscreens (also counterintuitively known as “organic” sunscreens) absorb harmful UV rays. Mineral sunscreens (also known as physical sunscreens) create a shield-like layer on top of the skin to deflect them.The bans focus on some chemical sunscreens, with oxybenzone, one of the most commonly used ingredients, attracting particular ire. A 2015 study by Dr Craig Downs, an expert on the impacts of sunscreens on marine life, suggested that the ingredient (an organic compound also known as benzophenone-3) had a toxic effect on coral even at a concentration equivalent to one drop in 6.5 Olympic-size swimming pools.But not everyone agrees that there is a problem. Dr Emma Meredith, director general of the UK’s Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), is “disappointed” by the bans. She cites a lack of scientific evidence linking oxybenzone, octinoxate (a UVB-absorbing compound) and coral reef discolouration, and adds: “Cosmetic ingredients and their safety are kept under constant review by the European Commission and EU member states.”L’Oréal, which sells both chemical and mineral sunscreens, has worked with the Scientific Centre of Monaco to study the effects of its UV filters on coral bleaching. The report, published this year, states that L’Oréal’s five main organic filters do not negatively affect coral.“Each sun filter provides a specific type of protection, which is why sunscreen products or daily photo-protection products are usually composed of a combination of filters to guarantee the most adapted protection,” says a spokesperson for the company, which states that all products undergo a strict safety evaluation for humans and the environment before being placed on sale.But consumers are taking matters into their own hands, with brands reacting in turn. Worldwide, Google searches for “reef-safe sunscreen” have more than quadrupled in the past five years, with brands including Caudalie, Banana Boat and Badger adding “oxybenzone-free” or “reef-friendly” labels to relevant products. Boots Soltan says none of its sunscreens contains oxybenzone or octinoxate, because “we work hard to ensure we source ingredients that protect environments across the globe”.The French skincare brand Avène has never used oxybenzone, but made a “conscious decision” to cut out octinoxate in 2010, according to Marine Dumas, its international product manager for suncare. The brand has now developed a patented UV filter system as part of its Skin Protect, Ocean Respect commitment, and partnered with Pur Projet on a socio-environmental project for the regeneration of corals in Indonesia. Dumas welcomes Hawaii and Palau’s bans. “This will force cosmetic companies that still use these sun filters to find other solutions,” she says.Nevertheless, there are concerns over what chemical sunscreens do to us aside from protect. Many “clean beauty” advocates – those who avoid products containing suspected toxins – already boycott chemical sunscreens due to concerns that they may be absorbed into the body. A recent study, published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that sunscreen chemicals can seep into your bloodstream after just 24 hours of use, although there is no data yet on whether or not they have a negative effect. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has called for further testing to determine the ingredients’ safety for repeated use, although it urges consumers to continue using sunscreens to protect themselves.One advantage of chemical over mineral sunscreens is their ability to sink invisibly into the skin and to be formulated into thinner, less greasy creams and gels. Mineral particles are renowned for leaving a tell-tale, chalky finish to the skin, and often turn milky upon contact with water or sweat, making them less popular in water-resistant sunscreens. Formulas have improved over recent years, but there are still entire Reddit threads devoted to finding mineral products that won’t leave white marks, especially on darker skin tones.Inevitably, mineral filters come with their own environmental controversies. Many formulas use nanoparticles of zinc oxide or titanium oxide, which some studies suggest could themselves damage coral and be absorbed by other marine life. Consequently, brands including Ren and Coola have developed “non-nano” sunscreens (using particles larger than 100 nanometres).“CTPA is always concerned that unfounded claims about the safety and efficacy of sun protection products actually undermine sun protection products in general,” says Meredith. “This could have serious health implications if consumers choose to avoid the use of any sunscreen because confidence in them has been diminished.”He adds that while oxybenzone does appear to affect coral reefs, it is far from the greatest threat they face.“The degradation of coral reefs resulting from coral bleaching is a direct effect of temperature anomalies caused by climate change. Sunscreen compounds may contribute to the background stress on corals, but so do other factors, such as nutrient pollution and overfishing, which are having a far greater effect. Sometimes there is a tendency to panic, and a danger that people will come to the wrong conclusions and take focus away from the real difficulties.”Wiedenmann points out that, in places such as Hawaii, enclosed bays in which a lot of people swim near coral are at the greatest risk, so precautions make sense. What about the rest of us? “If I was near a reef, I’d avoid using a sunscreen with oxybenzone,” he says. “But if I was in the UK, in my back garden? I don’t think I’d be too worried.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/223b0d26cd4691407f6331def2549a9053f23bb6/0_0_4228_2815/master/4228.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e51ac09eb445161abc4ee16b6ace2b37 880w","title":"blue my mind review horror","story":"Luna Wedler delivers a good performance as a shy teenager navigating a new school – and a body that is radically changingSwiss actor and film-maker Lisa Brühlmann, known in Britain for stylishly directing episodes of the TV programme Killing Eve, finally has her debut film, from 2017, released in the UK. The film looks at first like a young girl’s Euro-arthouse teen awakening, full of damaged sexuality, but it gradually becomes a body-horror romance in the manner of David Cronenberg, with a worrying hint of Ed Wood Jr. The corporeal surreality could be read as a metaphor for menstruation or depression or abuse, but it is presented as true and comes across as perfunctory and a bit flippant.Mia (Luna Wedler) is a shy 15-year-old who has just arrived in town and has to negotiate the horrors of a new high school. In time-honoured movie style, she tries hanging out with the mean-girl clique and finally becomes accepted by them, particularly the queen bitch, Gianna (Zoë Pastelle Holthuizen). In a sad attempt to be supercool and impress them, Mia hooks up with a middle-aged man in a seedy hotel room. But something is very wrong: she has strange marks on her legs, the skin on her toes seems to be joining up and she has weird yearning memories of the ocean.On a realist level, there are flaws: having been terrified and upset by Mia’s behaviour, would her parents really leave her alone in the house for the weekend while they go away for a wedding? Something awful would surely happen and duly does. When the big reveal happens, I wondered if perhaps a little more of the budget should have been spent on the special creature effects.

The film is a tonal and topical follow-up to his previous feature, I, Daniel Blake, and tackles the impact of working in the gig economy on families. It premiered at the Cannes film festival in May.Sorry We Missed You stars Kris Hitchen as a builder whose employment prospects plummeted after the 2008 financial crisis and who is persuaded to work on a freelance – yet perilously indebted – basis for a major delivery company. His wife (Debbie Honeywood) is a contract nurse and in-home carer to elderly and disabled people. Both are under enormous pressure during the day at work, and again at night, dealing with their troubled son and his sister. critic Peter Bradshaw described the work as “fierce, open and angry, unironised and unadorned”. In Cannes, Loach blamed the new way of working depicted in his film on the shoulders of “fake left” politicans such as Tony Blair, whose brand of “caring capitalism” he says resulted in rising job insecurity.In 2016, Loach won the Palme d’Or for I, Daniel Blake, a story of a carpenter with a heart condition struggling to negotiate the benefits system.

Let’s hear her tell us a little about herself ... Scotland manager Shelley Kerr makes three changes to the team that started against Japan. Full-back Lizzie Arnot, midfielder Hayley Lauder and striker Jane Ross make way for Nicola Docherty, Leanne Crichton and Claire Emslie.Asked by Fifa for her thoughts on today’s opponents, Scotland and Manchester City midfielder Caroline Weir suggested her side will not be underestimating their opponents. “They look aggressive, they look fast, they look physical, it’s going to be another difficult game and one that we won’t take lightly at all,” she said. “It’s going to be tough. We have nothing to lose, we have to go for it and it makes it exciting for us as players. It’s very clear what we have to do: we have to get three points. Sometimes it’s easier going into a game like that, knowing that it’s a must win.”Everybody loves a good row and one has been simmering between the former USA goalkeeper-turned-pundit, Hope Solo and Scotland manager Shelley Kerr. Solo was less than complimentary about Kerr when Scotland went in at the break 2-0 down against Japan in their last game, following defeat in their opener against England. Following an improved second-half performance they went on to lose 2-1 for the second time in as many games.“This is what I was hoping Shelley Kerr would have fixed from the first game on Sunday,” said Solo. “Unfortunately the verdict is out if she is a great tactician and right now I have my doubts. It goes back to the first game that Scotland played against England. These are the differences between a win and a loss and this is what I wanted Shelley Kerr to affect. She said she was going to go back and watch the footage, break down the video, and she still has not made these changes.” Kerr was withering in her response when told about Solo’s criticism of her work, insisting the American has not earned the right to criticise her. “Listen, I’ve no problem with stick, I’ll take it all day long – just maybe off someone who comes from coaching stock,” she said. “Tactically I thought we got things right against Japan. We made some errors in the first half but I thought our game plan was working really well. Japan’s movement is incredible. They maybe don’t have great pace but the way they move off the ball makes up for that. Combating these things is always easier said than done.” Solo had accused Scotland’s players of dropping too deep and giving their Japanese opponents too much time on the ball. “Japan, right now, are doing what they want to do on the ball because of the amount of space on the field,” she said. “I’m not seeing a lot of movement in the entire Scottish team, there’s no dynamic runs and everyone’s just kind of waiting for the ball.” Parc des Princes is the venue where Scotland play Argentina for the very first time in one of two remaining matches in Group D. At the same time in Nice, England and Nice will go toe to toe, with both sides having already qualified for the last 16. Having lost their opening two games, Scotland must win tonight to have any chance of progressing as one of the best third placed sides on goal difference.While they are still in the hunt for second place in the group, a win for Argentina would guarantee their progress to the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed teams at least. Kick-off is at 8pm BST but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.

It’s so irresponsible.”But rather than address the concerns directly, both companies flatly denied that there was a problem, even while admitting that they did not collect the data required to answer many of the committee’s questions.When presented with Harry’s remarks, Epic’s general counsel, Canon Pence, said they “couldn’t be further from the truth about our ethics and design philosophy”.He added: “It’s always been our effort and intent to create a fun, fair, flexible, engaging and generous form of interactive entertainment. A statement that suggests it’s some sort of nefarious attempt to extract short-term profit is a mischaracterisation.”But neither Pence nor his colleague, director of marketing Matthew Weissinger, could answer more direct questions about how many users were playing the game an unhealthy amount.“We think it’s difficult to have a categorical understanding of what that is given it varies from time to time and person to person,” Pence said.Weissinger declined to reveal the game’s average revenue per player, arguing that it was a trade secret, but then appeared to confuse himself over other data points. At one point, when committee chair Damian Collins asked how Epic defined frequent players, Weissinger said they were “someone who’s played within the last two weeks, or 30 days”.When Collins then asked how much time frequent players spent playing Fortnite, Weissinger said that it was “difficult” to define a frequent player, leaving the MP baffled.Collins declared his disbelief at Epic’s claims of ignorance. “This is a game which makes money out of people playing it,” he said, “and this sort of basic information is something that will be gathered and analysed all the time, so I don’t believe that you don’t know it. For me, it arouses the suspicion that this is not something we can discuss. Of course it will vary, but I’m sure you have an idea of what the answer to these questions are.”The MP looked more surprised when Pence responded by taking issue with his choice of words. Pence said: “I don’t think it’s accurate to define Epic as making money from people playing the game.” “You’re not a charity,” responded Collins.The Labour MP Ian Lucas pressed Pence on why the company did not collect dates of birth from its users.“You don’t think it’s necessary to abide by data regulations by establishing the age of the people who play your game?” Lucas asked.“We don’t,” said Pence. Later in the hearing, Pence denied giving that response, prompting Lucas to suggest he check the record of the hearing.In June 2018, the World Health Organisation recognised gaming disorder as a psychological condition, amid concern about the compulsive behaviours that some games can inflict upon players.But others have argued that the problems of gaming are more subtle: if a free-to-play game such as Fortnite can offer potentially thousands of hours of enjoyment for nothing, then, economists such as Prof Erik Hurst have argued, it should not be surprising if players choose to spend an ever greater portion of their leisure time logging on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/308814353b5c333eb454b2436dfa8e48c89185ca/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eae3bbdac3935a222bc35308ae3eae7","title":"the 16 best games of e3 2019","story":"After a full week of glitzy announcements and hundreds of game teasers, the ’s E3 correspondents pick their best of the showAmid the onslaught of announcements during Sunday’s Xbox briefing, it would have been easy to miss this fascinating experimental game from coder and artist Luis Antonio, who previously worked on Jonathan Blow’s acclaimed adventure The Witness. You play as a nameless man stuck in a 12-minute time loop involving his wife, their apartment and some unexpected visitors. Seeing things from a neat top-down perspective, the player has to untangle the series of events, discovering more about the mystery with each short life. Channeling Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, this is a truly intriguing project.Considering how large a role death plays in video games, it’s rare to find one that explores the concept in a meaningful way. Here is one rather beautiful example. In Spiritfarer you play Stella, whose job it is to row the recently departed across the river into the afterlife. But Stella’s passengers (represented by their animal spirits) have tasks for her to complete so they can rest in peace, and all the while she has to maintain her boat, adding furniture and tending to crops. It’s like a postmortem Stardew Valley, which sounds sad, but you do get to hug all your passengers.Young Melbourne-based developer Anthony Tan was in his teens when he started work on this gorgeously minimalistic adventure about a deer guiding a companion through mysterious woodland. En route you encounter communities of raccoons and intelligent cats that bring to mind the novels of Richard Adams. With a warm, pastel-coloured art inspired by Studio Ghibli and subtle apocalyptic undertones drawn from Tan’s love of The Last of Us, we’re expecting a meaningful, elegiac tale when the game arrives on PC and consoles later this year.The latest peek at CD Projekt Red’s follow-up to the Witcher 3 has sparked mixed reactions. For some, the game’s explorations of race and gender in the year 2077 are handled with a lack of finesse. But this isn’t Grand Theft Auto, and the game’s world-building goes beyond puerile in-jokes between developer and player: our own brief venture into Night City suggested a richly textured setting, displaying an understanding of the themes of the genre that doesn’t simply end at neon and prosthetics.Obsidian’s pitch for the Outer Worlds couldn’t be clearer: the folks who made the best game in the Fallout series, New Vegas, are here to rescue you from Fallout 76 with an all new fun and funny first person retro-futurist RPG. Yes, the satirical targets are different now – the key touchpoint is the Old West, replete with company towns, private security forces and frontier justice – but fans of Bethesda’s flagging series should find plenty here to scratch that itch. Most interesting from the glimpse we were given is a new personality trait, Leadership, which stands alongside conventional focuses like stealth or dialogue and allows you to make much better use of your companions’ abilities.Vying with Majora’s Mask for the title of weirdest Zelda game is Link’s Awakening, a surreal Game Boy iteration of the famous series from 1992 that saw hero Link washed up on an island that may or may not be a figment of his imagination. This upcoming Switch remake embraces a toylike aesthetic that only adds to the dreamlike feel. It’s a game that plenty of modern players will never have experienced in the original monochrome, two-inch-square version, but even for those who have, it’s more than a nostalgia trip. An absorbing, endearing, strange adventure to look forward to at the end of the year.Dating simulator and dungeon crawler: two great flavours, together for the first time. The premise of Boyfriend Dungeon is simple, not that you’d know it from the look of bafflement on people’s faces when they hear about it for the first time: you are a hot single adventurer, looking for love, and also for weaponry to explore dungeons for loot. Luckily for you, your address book is full of people who can fulfil both requirements, because as well as being beautiful singles looking to meet similar, they are also weapons. This is no Persona-style metaphor. Your hot boyfriend will literally turn into a scimitar when you need to fight with him. It could be a one-trick pony, but the latest E3 demo suggests that the game has the substance to deliver on the premise, particularly when it comes to the dungeon-crawling action.This vampire role-playing game is set in modern-day Seattle, where tech-industry bloodsuckers are stalking the streets alongside the more traditional fang-toothed ones. It’s heavily narrative-driven, centred on the players’ choices and their effects, foreseen and unforeseen, on other characters, vampire politics and the city itself. A dense web of warring vampire bloodlines, informants, betrayals and relationships provides the backdrop for this thinking person’s supernatural horror.The Assassin’s Creed teams at Ubisoft have mostly leaned on actual history to inspire their extraordinary recreations of ancient, Victorian, renaissance and early-modern cities and periods, rather than mythology. But as the last two games have centred on ancient Egypt and ancient Greece, it’s perhaps no surprise that they have felt called towards mythology instead. Presented as a story told by Homer, Gods and Monsters is Zelda meets Greek myths, with a softer art style and more whimsical approach than Assassin’s Creed. Like Nintendo’s Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it relies on the player’s curiosity and ingenuity to propel them forwards through the world, discovering new skills and secrets.Finally a Star Wars game that looks and feels like a hero-driven space adventure. Developer Respawn was responsible for the best single-player shooter campaign in recent history with Titanfall 2, and after EA’s previous two single-player Star Wars games were unceremoniously cancelled, it’s a relief to see Fallen Order looking so promising. It’s got the Star Wars hallmarks of snappy dialogue, lightsaber combat driven by counters and parries, and Jedi powers – and it offers the freedom to travel between planets and explore the Star Wars fiction outside of its scripted cinematic moments.Near the start of the new Doom’s E3 demo, you need to get from an orbital base to Mars. Other games might have you commandeer a shuttle, or teleport, but as far as Doom is concerned, other games are cowards: Doom Eternal asks you to fight your way over a cannon that’s bombarding the surface, kick out the ammunition, climb in the chamber and shoot yourself onwards. Doom Infinite is hyperviolent, sublime silliness: 2016’s Doom reboot already turned everything up to 11, and yet this somehow outdoes it.We didn’t want to allow ourselves to hope, but hallelujah, this long-awaited game is GOOD. This is no rerelease or remaster: Final Fantasy VII has been fully remade, and the result is an entirely new game that just happens to share a story and characters with the 1997 original. Purists may wail over the changes, but only for as long as it takes them to remember that the original was, well, showing its age. In its place is something as visually stunning in 2019 as the original was 22 years ago, with exciting battles akin to Square’s Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy XV – but where those games rapidly descended into unsatisfying button-mashing, FFVII: Remake’s is a commanding mix of style and strategy.“Play as any character in the city” is the sort of claim that looks good on the back of a box, but falls apart when you actually try to implement it. And yet Ubisoft looks to have pulled off the impossible. Recruiting disuillusioned Londoners to join the ranks of hacking collective DedSec forms the core of Watch Dogs Legion, a ferociously complex game set in a smartly realised, dystopian, post-Brexit future London in thrall to private military contractors. Fall in combat, and you’re given an option: surrender, or carry on fighting. Pick the former, and the mission fails, but that character will be released from jail a few real-world hours later and you’ll be able to play as them again. Pick the latter, and you get one last chance to win – but fail, and they’re dead for good. The one persistent character is the city of London itself. Watch Dogs’ recreation may understandably fudge the backstreets, but head to the landmarks and it’s the best video game version of the British capital we’ve ever seen.The adaptation no-one saw coming captures the John Wick films, responsible for the umpteenth revival of Keanu Reeves’ stardom. The films are known for their trademark “gun-fu” action: a methodical fight choreography where every bullet counts, where guns are as likely to be used as projectiles as they are to fire them. John Wick is a superhero, and his superpower is guns. In another world, the films would have been turned into a prosaic cover shooter, but thankfully indie developer Bithell Games convinced Lionsgate to go a different route and emphasise the tactical elements of Wick’s fighting. An early version of the game was a straightforward turn-based tactical game – a sort of one person Xcom, Bithell says – until Wick director Chad Stahelski saw the edit and asked, reasonably, why Wick was standing there letting others shoot at him. And so, in the finished game, the action is much more fluid.A sequel to the sleeper hit of 201718, casting adversary-turned-ally Hornet as the lead in a whole new adventure that combines idvania-style exploration with Dark Souls-esque brutal combat. A few small tweaks alter the feel of the game: for one thing, Hornet speaks (in text), conversing with the denizens of the new underworld she is exploring. Experienced players will need to retrain their reflexes to suit the tweaked combat. For anyone craving a return to the world of Hollow Knight – which is, surely, anyone who played it - Silksong is an easy sell.Impressive to watch and extremely difficult to explain, Control is a reality-bending action game in which nothing is as it seems. Characters sometimes make no sense when they talk. Dialogue is weird and stilted. You can fling things around with your mind, and sometimes you fall through the floor into a void of suspended abstract architecture. It’s vastly more intriguing than any other shooter at the show. We were deeply weirded out by it, and haven’t quite been able to shake it from our minds.There were a lot of promising-looking games teased this year that weren’t actually playable, but which were nonetheless exciting. Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Halo Infinite and a sequel to Zelda: Breath of the Wild all made huge splashes with trailers alone, as did Ghostwire: Tokyo and Deathloop. Telling Lies, from the creator of Her Story, has you digging through hours of NSA surveillance footage of four characters’ lives. Fall Guys looks like a madly fun multiplayer brawler, a la Gang Beasts. Skate Bird, a pun made playable, turns you into a skateboarding pigeon (or wren, or robin). And though Pokémon Sword and Shield doesn’t exactly revolutionise Pokémon, we had a good time wandering its whimsical British-inspired world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78be3029efe29b320146ff44b431bf5f7232cee/0_168_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf71a4234d308831ca333c2db0da4b5d","title":"malnourishment blamed for rise in encephalitis in bihar","story":"Indian medics say children falling ill after filling up on fruit and going to bed with no dinnerThe recent deaths of more than 110 children in India from encephalitis have been attributed to natural toxins in lychees. But experts now suggest that the fruit itself may not be the cause of the illness but mainly the fact that poor children go to bed on an empty stomach after eating it.At least 31 children have died in Bihar state from acute encephalitis syndrome, according to health officials. Angry parents of the dead children have been protesting at the Sri Krishna medical college in Muzaffarpur, the district where most of the deaths occurred.Some confronted Nitesh Kumar, Bihar state’s chief minister, for visiting the hospital only after the death toll passed 100, a full fortnight after children began to be brought in suffering convulsions and high fever.What precisely causes the brain inflammation is not clear. Heat and humidity could be factors, and also genetic predisposition because not all the children in a family fall ill despite the same conditions. Several studies have pointed to a connection between malnutrition and a toxin found in lychees. The fruit grows abundantly in the orchards of Muzaffarpur. Crucially, doctors have noticed that children who live in the city and are from more affluent backgrounds have not been among the dead. It is only children from impoverished rural families who have fallen ill.Arun Shah of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, who thinks the unofficial death toll is probably in excess of 200, said: “They roam around all day in the heat eating lychees to feel full.“It’s not the taste they are after but just filling their stomachs. Then they go home and go to bed without having a proper meal because their parents are too poor. It’s not the lychee that’s the culprit but malnourishment.”Shah and his colleagues described the disease background in various studies and in a report published in the Lancet Global Health journal in 2017, based on a study carried out by the National Centre for Disease Control in India, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Their study found that children in the affected villages ate lychees during the day and often did not have dinner. The toxin known as hypoglycin A, which is naturally present in lychees, leads to a reduction in blood sugar levels during the night, causing hypoglycaemia. Typically, the children fell ill the next morning after eating the fruit, with serious symptoms such as high fever, brain function derangement and seizures.Doctors say children can be treated through an infusion of dextrose within four hours of the onset of the illness. An equally simple preventive technique is to ensure that no child goes to bed without eating a meal first.Outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome have occurred annually during summer months in the same Bihar districts since 1995.“To prevent illness and reduce mortality in the region, we recommended minimising lychee consumption, ensuring receipt of an evening meal and implementing rapid glucose correction for suspected illness,” the Lancet report said.In 2016, Shah and a team of additional doctors gave clear guidelines to the Bihar government, telling parents to keep their children away from lychee orchards between April and June, and urging ministers to tackle malnutrition in the poorest families and educate parents about the need to give children an evening meal if they have eaten lychees during the day.“The number of deaths fell in 2017-18 because the Bihar government began implementing these guidelines. But this year they took their eye off the ball because they were too caught up with the general election. I would say the state government is certainly guilty of shortcomings and carelessness,” said Shah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dab984c0a74b8c7bed3ef50ef57f310c8e38ea7b/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bbb4cb09f87fc9c2735c25e2af3decd","title":"later in life virgins at my age it becomes a red flag","story":"In these open-minded times, one taboo has held steady: never having had sex at all. Four thirtysomething virgins explain how they deal with the stigmaRichard’s colleagues call him their work therapist. He’s empathetic and a good listener, he says – “so a lot of people tell me about their personal shit”, including the people he works with at his retail management job in the south-eastern US. But when they complain to him about their sex lives, or he sees happy couples hand-in-hand in the shop, “I think: ‘That’s not something that’s going to happen for me.’” At 31, Richard is a virgin.If it seems as though taboos about sex have lifted in these ostensibly open-minded times, there is one that holds steady: the stigma over never having had sex. While it has become widely unacceptable to criticise someone for having too many partners, being a virgin “still seems to be something that can be only mocked or shamed or suspect”, says Richard.Yet there are many reasons that a thirty or fortysomething might never have had sex, says Libby, a 37-year-old Canadian. “It could be tied to mental health issues, ranging from low self-esteem and social anxiety to serious depression. It could be due to a childhood of abuse, or physical health issues like cerebral palsy, or a religious upbringing, or even lack of comprehensive sex education.”Libby connects her virginity to her personality traits (“cynical, private, loud, opinionated and chubby – though my friends would say I’m being too hard on myself”) and her 10-year struggle with depression and anxiety. “When I was sick, I could barely get out of bed, let alone put myself out there to potential partners.”When she was well, she found that medication – for her mental health, and oral contraceptives to mitigate her very painful periods – wiped out her libido. “And if you don’t have the drive, sex isn’t something you pursue,” says Libby. “I don’t blame drugs entirely – as I said, I never put much effort into dating and sex – but I do think they play a large part in my story.”Richard also identifies poor mental health as a factor in his virginity. He is now on antidepressants and – following substance abuse in his 20s – sober. He guesses that his religious upbringing – where sex was not discussed beyond “Don’t do it” – was also influential. But, maybe counterintuitively, he says the reason he has not had sex is that, to him, it’s not just about sex. “If that was all I wanted to accomplish, I would’ve just gone out and got it over with a long time ago.” He has had “a handful” of chances to lose his virginity, but drunken opportunities at parties when he was younger “just didn’t feel right”, and his subsequent sobriety put an end to those.Dating apps are no solution – for him or many others. As Libby puts it: “If someone is still a virgin after 30, they likely have some issues tied to it, none of which will be solved with a swipe to the right and a random hookup.”Although Richard describes himself as introverted and afraid of intimacy and rejection, he says the reason he struggles to approach strangers cold is “not because I’m desperate – it’s because I’m not that desperate”. He is articulate, even wryly humorous, about his virginity, even as he says it causes him day-to-day unhappiness. “It’s like trying to date with an STD that’s not contagious and easily curable, but still puts people off.”Although he desires a relationship more than sex, he says that at a certain point his status can become self-perpetuating. “At my age, it becomes a red flag for people. I don’t really have interpersonal romantic experience, not even just on a physical level, but on an emotional level, too.”He rejects the stereotype that lack of sexual experience extends to life experience (in the style of Steve Carrell’s naive 40-Year-Old Virgin). “I’ve been through a lot, even for a regular person.” Nor is he a “mopey neckbeard or, even worse, incel” – the group of overwhelmingly misogynistic men who blame women for their poor sex lives.A few years ago, Richard went to see a sex therapist, but never returned. “He asked me – and this will always stick in my head – ‘Why don’t you just pay someone if you want to have sex?’ “I said: ‘Well, I want someone to want me, I want to want them, I want us to want to do this.’ He got really indignant. ‘It’s just sex – you need to get over yourself.’”The thing is, says Richard, “you don’t know who’s going to judge you for it or who won’t. There’s no way to tell.”The therapist spent the rest of the hour practising a mindfulness technique, says Richard. “‘Like, ‘Tell me what you think of yourself with regards to relationships – what would you be without this thought?’ I thought: ‘I wouldn’t be in your office right now, paying you $200.’”Three years ago Richard was pursued by a woman who retreated after learning, via a game of 20 questions over text, that he was a virgin. “When I kind of pried, she said that she thought that she would ‘ruin’ me.” That response is not uncommon, he says. “It’s like they’re dictating your sexuality for you, in a way – what you are and aren’t ready for, what you can handle emotionally, just based on that one titbit about you.”Julia, from Los Angeles, also comes up against preconceptions. At 31 going on 32, she is an evangelical Christian and still a virgin, as is her boyfriend. People in secular circles are surprised to learn they have never had sex – “My boyfriend’s business partner wondered if he’s secretly gay since we’re not doing it” – but then so are some Christians. These days, she says, most young evangelicals have premarital sex (or rush into marriage). “I was actually surprised that my boyfriend is a virgin – that’s how common it is.”It is not easy staying chaste, Julia says – “we have to be proactively careful about that”, particularly when they are travelling together – but their church community keeps them accountable. “And I have a very full and rich life as a virgin.”That said, she and her boyfriend are seriously discussing marriage she’s already warned him that they are going to “have sex every day, seven days a week” (although the novelty may wear off, she concedes). “I’m excited to have sex with my future husband. What we lack in experience, we’ll learn together.”But, Julia agrees, as a virgin by choice she is an anomaly. For others the hurdles can seem insurmountable.Jim, a 35-year-old from East Sussex, has never been kissed. He had few friends in secondary school, where his confidence was shot by bullying, and his social circle has dwindled since then. Like Richard, he is sober, thereby missing out on pubs and clubs – “the main route for kids in the 90s to have gotten together with someone”. He works in IT, a male-dominated industry, and although he has some hobbies (archery, rock-climbing) he feels women there aren’t open to being approached, if he even knew how. “You don’t want to seem unwelcome or forceful.”Holding him back, he says, are absence of opportunity, his looks (he describes himself as in shape but balding, and “just not nice-looking”), his shyness and his lack of self-confidence – which worsens with each passing year.He has never told anyone that he is a virgin. “It’s not something that has come up. If it did, I would probably lie and say that I had sex when I was 16 or 18 but that I haven’t had it in ages. It’s never having been in a relationship that bothers me more.” For that reason, he says, he decided against going to a sex worker when he considered it a few years ago. “I got to thinking that if I paid for it, that would probably make me feel even more worthless.”Sex, as he sees it, is a destination, but he is more interested in the journey. “It’s the getting a girlfriend, a partner – going to places with someone, who you can talk about your day with, and they’ll be listening. ‘Virgin’ is the easiest tag to apply, but there’s more to it than that. It’s an experience that’s been missing from me, and from other people.”It bothers him more some days than it does others, he says – but the number of times he has avoided a town centre because of not wanting to see couples is “worryingly high”. Richard says something similar. “When I meet someone or see someone I find attractive, instead of feeling a little spark, there’s just a feeling in the pit in my stomach that says: ‘Nothing’s ever going to happen.’”Libby, however, is feeling good about the future. Over the past few years her health has improved, allowing her to invest in her work, home, family and friendships. At New Year’s, she realised that her only regret about the years she had spent unwell was her lack of dating and sexual experience. She changed medication “and it seems to be the right cocktail. I’m feeling better than I have in a long time and, as an unexpected bonus, my libido woke up.”She has since signed up for two online dating sites and had more good experiences than bad. Until very recently, only her two closest friends knew she was a virgin. “Now that I’m dating, I find myself telling potential interests fairly early on,” she says. “It’s a great way to weed out undesirable guys.” She hopes her future partners will be patient, open to teaching, and willing to go at her pace.“I know it won’t be perfect or like a romance novel or a porn video, but it will be my first time, on my terms. And a weight will be lifted off my shoulders.”All names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd112c7dc16ce15b9a8856bc02eb989d9b201684/0_0_4394_2638/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebc27e609fa7741e77ef220b97915b35","title":"the 14 things you need to know before you go vegan","story":"The environmental, health and ethical benefits of veganism are beyond doubt. But what if you feel a bit intimidated by the idea? Some experts offer their adviceMore and more of us are going vegan. The environmental and ethical case for a diet free of all animal products, including meat, fish, dairy and eggs, is compelling. According to research from the University of Oxford, going vegan is the “single biggest way” to reduce your impact on the planet. And that is before you consider the ethical arguments against eating industrially farmed animals, which have an appalling quality of life and are often pumped full of powerful antibiotics that may pose a risk to human health.But if you are a lifelong meat-eater, it is hard to know where to start. We asked some leading vegans for their advice for adults who want to make the transition.“I don’t think there is a right answer about whether to do it immediately or not,” says Henry Firth, one half of the vegan social-media sensation Bosh!. “It’s about what’s right for you and what’s sustainable for your lifestyle.” Some experts suggest easing into veganism via a sightseeing tour of the world of vegetarianism, while others favour going cold tofu.Katy Beskow, a longtime vegan and the author of three bestselling cookbooks, suggests a gradual approach. “The availability of vegan products means you can do it so much more easily than before. My advice is to replace products in your diet with alternatives step by step, be it milk, mayonnaise or yoghurt. That way, you won’t see a difference.”Kill the haters with kindness – and delicious food. “You can make your meat jokes or tell me I’m going to die, but I’m comfortable with my decision,” says the author and columnist Isa Chandra Moskowitz. “Treat people with kindness, even if they are being jerks. And cook for them – you get to show them how yummy things are. It’s a really beautiful gesture that stops people from being aggressive and helps them to see that the food is good – and you’re OK.”Be empathic towards people expressing negative attitudes. “I can understand when people have some negativity towards veganism because I was in that position once,” says the YouTuber, chef and author Gaz Oakley. “It was just fear of the unknown and not being educated on the matter.” Treat such encounters as a teaching opportunity – but don’t lecture people. “If I’m at a party and someone makes a little dig about veganism, it’s just about educating them and making them feel at ease. Say stuff such as: ‘I never thought I would be a vegan until I saw this or found out this.’ Don’t be judgmental or argue back. Just try to educate them as best you can.”Humour helps. “I remember doing a TV programme once where someone asked me: ‘How bad are your farts because you’re a vegan?’” says the poet, actor and musician Benjamin Zephaniah. “I said: ‘Your farts smell of dead, rotting flesh. My farts smell like broccoli. Don’t worry about mine, man – think about yours.’”“It’s the only time people ever ask you about protein, when you go vegan,” Beskow says. “Protein deficiency is a really rare thing in the western world. It’s just about combining protein such as beans, pulses, seeds and nuts. It sounds as if you’re eating rabbit food, but you’re not. You can just sprinkle a handful of toasted pine nuts over some pasta or add a can of beans into your chilli.”Heather Russell, a registered dietician at the Vegan Society, says there is no cause for concern. “A common myth is that it’s difficult to get protein from plant foods. In reality, they can provide all the essential protein building blocks that we call amino acids. Good sources include beans, lentils, chickpeas, soya products, peanut butter, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds.”If you are going vegan, it is important to make sure you get enough vitamin B12 – commonly found in meat, eggs and fish – as without it, you will feel exhausted and weak. You can get B12 from fortified foods including “dairy alternatives, breakfast cereal, dairy-free spread and yeast extract”, says Russell. Alternatively, you can take a B12 supplement, which you can buy in most pharmacies and health-food stores. Russell also advises you think about your calcium intake. “Fortified plant milk contains the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk, and fortified yoghurt alternatives, calcium-set tofu, and a soya and linseed bread fortified with extra calcium are also really rich sources.”Zephaniah hears this a lot. “I speak to single parents who say: ‘When I’m going down to the supermarket, you think I’ve got time to go and nip into a health food store and read all the labels? I’ve got three kids in tow!’” He tries to allay their concerns. “Basically, we want fruit, vegetables and lentils of various kinds. Forget about all the posh cuisines and all that stuff. That’s all right if you’ve got the money for it. But veganism, in principle, should be really cheap.”If you are on a limited budget, steer clear of processed foods. “It’s a myth that vegan food has to be expensive,” says Firth. “In order to keep it cheap, though, it’s a good idea to avoid products that even say ‘vegan’ on them. So you’re not going to go to the expensive supermarkets and buy products in plastic that have been made in labs or factories they’re going to be expensive. You’re just going to go back to basics and eat fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts and beans – and you are going to be incredibly healthy, as well as saving money.”That depends on whether you trust them to respect your dietary preferences. “If I’m going to a friend’s house who really respects my veganism and will make the effort to look after me, I will,” Zephaniah says. “But, on the whole, I don’t want people to bend over backwards for me, so I’ll say: ‘Let’s go out,’ or: ‘I’ll come round and you have your dinner and we’ll have some drinks.’”A good approach for any well-mannered guest is to offer to bring a vegan dish with them. “By offering to bring some food, you’re contributing and you’re getting a chance to show delicious food to everyone who is not vegan, as well as taking the stress or annoyance out of the hands of the host,” says Firth. If the host prefers to cook, remind them of what you can and can’t eat – animal products have a way of slipping into things – so that they don’t accidentally put fish sauce in your curry. You may even want to suggest a recipe for them to try. But the most important thing is to have a frank conversation with your host before you turn up at their front door. “The one thing you don’t want to do is just turn up without having made a plan or had a conversation,” says Firth. “That’s going to annoy anyone.”Breaking a decades-long attachment to the smells, flavours and textures of meat can be hard. Perhaps you are hungover and craving a bacon sandwich or at a barbecue when the smell of sausages wafts over to you. The good news is that nowadays it is easy to recreate the flavours and textures of meat in vegan food, whether it is a plant-based burger that bleeds like real meat, jackfruit “pulled pork” or seitan with the texture and crunch of fried chicken. “In my recipes and YouTube videos, often I recreate certain dishes, whether it’s vegan chicken, beefsteaks or turkey – whatever else I can veganise,” says Oakley. “You can get that same texture and taste when you’re vegan. You’re spoilt for choice these days. You can get chicken, ribs, bacon, steaks, burgers, sausages – everything is available. When I went vegan four years ago, those things weren’t there.”“Eat familiar recipes and replace ingredients with plant-based alternatives,” says Beskow. Take shepherd’s pie: “Instead of mince, you can use a can of green lentils. That way, you are getting some of your five a day because you have onion, carrot and celery, just as you would with any shepherd’s pie, but you’re hiding those lentils in there.” If you simply cannot eat your greens, do as parents of toddlers do and puree some vegetables, then bung them in a pasta sauce.But you are going to have to get over your vegetable phobia at some point. “Vegan or not, you should be working vegetables into your life,” says Moskowitz. “I don’t know if it’s good to say: ‘I don’t like any vegetables, so I can’t go vegan.’ You’re going to have trouble actually living.”If you only eat salad, perhaps – but what a joyless life that would be. “Well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages,” says Russell. “They can provide all the calories and nutrients needed to hit nutritional targets and maintain a healthy weight.”Being vegan doesn’t mean you are on a diet. Beskow urges converts to indulge in all their favourite treats from their pre-vegan lifestyle, in moderation. “If you are used to eating biscuits, you can buy lots of biscuits in supermarkets that are accidentally vegan … Have some crisps, enjoy your food – that’s what it’s all about. People see veganism as so restrictive and about saying no, but it’s about saying yes – but to different things.”If you are fortunate enough to have access to a garden or an allotment, get out there. Growing your own fruit and vegetables can be a great way to keep a vegan diet interesting. “I live in the middle of a field in Lincolnshire,” says Zephaniah. He has devoted a part of his garden to growing vegetables in summer, he always has a glut. “I hardly have to go to a supermarket – I’ve got too much food. I have to give it away to the neighbours.”Firth says: “You don’t need loads and loads of quirky ingredients. You can get a few base ingredients from your local shop and cook up thousands of delicious treats.” Most supermarkets, even in rural areas, will be able to cater to vegan diets. “I live in east Yorkshire and we don’t have any specialist vegan shops around us,” says Beskow. “But that’s OK because I don’t tend to shop in health-food shops or vegan shops anyway. Everything that I need is in the supermarket or the local market.” She advises following the Instagram account Accidentally Vegan, which uploads supermarket products that happen to be vegan.Let’s face it: all couples do these days is eat food in front of box sets. But what if your partner is an avowed steak-eater? Will it affect your relationship? Not necessarily, says Moskowitz. “Find food you both like, eat separately, do whatever you have to do. There are lots of relationships where people have different political ideologies most people have other things in common and that’s the reason they’re together.” Beskow’s fiance isn’t a vegan, but they muddle through: he doesn’t cook meat at home, but will eat meat when they go out for dinner. “I think it’s about making food you are both happy with, so they’re not missing out on anything.”Children can be healthy vegans. “It is possible to provide all the nutrients needed for growth and development without animal products,” Russell says. She advises parents to consult the Vegan Society website, which has detailed guidance on vegan diets for children of all ages, including infants, and can offer advice on which fortified foods and supplements it may be necessary for them to take.Bosh!’s Ian Theasby suggests a simple pasta dish: take vegetables, roast them in olive oil for half an hour, take them out of the oven and cover them with tinned tomatoes, then stick them back in for another 10 minutes. “What you are left with is an extremely tasty, really nutritious pasta sauce that will satisfy anybody.” Oakley suggests learning how to make a simple ramen. “Stir-fry some vegan protein, whether it’s tofu or vegan chicken, along with some vegetables. Get a nice vegetable stock, squeeze some miso paste in there, add some soy sauce and chilli, and throw in some noodles. You’ve got a quick ramen that takes you about 15 minutes.”We’re only human and we make mistakes. If you do end up eating some meat, take the time to rediscover why you went vegan in the first place. “Don’t get too down about it,” says Oakley. “We don’t live in a vegan world yet. It may even be out of your hands: perhaps you are given something that isn’t vegan. But refer back to the initial thing that made you go vegan. Get your real motivation and you won’t slip up.”The crucial thing, all the experts agree, is not to beat yourself up about it. “Vegans aren’t perfect,” says Zephaniah. “We just think it’s worth it. We’re trying to do the most good and the least harm. And that’s the best you can do. So just keep trying.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96b977888bb8f9af95072aa36c3ca57a2ba55d6/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9ada64cb5271a9f873d1dc0cedfe92","title":"bootcamps beauty and burnouts how to make it as a youtube vlogger podcast","story":"Young stars on the Google-owned site can become multi-millionaires almost overnight but controversy has stalked every stage of YouTube’s growth.

His employers said they were investigating, despite Thakar stating it was a parody of a speech by a rightwing US activist.The controversy surrounding the members of the public who asked questions overshadowed the third round of voting in the Tory leadership contest, with supporters of Boris Johnson criticising the BBC’s handling of the debate. The often noisy and chaotic discussion was the first debate to feature Johnson, who had refused to take part in Sunday night’s programme on Channel 4.But it was the aftermath, involving scrutiny of the people who asked the questions, which left the BBC justifying the right of members of the public to ask questions on television regardless of their political backgrounds.Some BBC News insiders questioned whether they owed a duty of care to warn members of the public who appear on political programmes that they are likely to have their social media and political backgrounds scrutinised.Patel questioned the five candidates about the impact of politicians’ words on Islamophobia in the UK – a nod to Johnson’s comments about women who wear the burqa resembling “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”.His question, which urged them, to accept that “words have consequences” prompted one of the candidates, Sajid Javid, to get all his rivals to commit to commissioning an independent investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative party should they win the contest.He also tweeted a map of the US, suggesting Israel should be moved there as a solution to the conflict with Palestine.In another tweet, Patel said women needed “to be smarter” to avoid being assaulted, saying: “Don’t be alone with a man!”On Wednesday, Yakub Patel, the chair of Al-Madani Educational Trust, which runs Al-Ashraf primary school, said: “Following some of the comments attributed to Mr Patel in the media this morning, the trust has decided to suspend him from all school duties with immediate effect until a full investigation is carried out. The school and trust do not share the views attributed to him.”His mosque said it had “chosen to give him some time away” while it investigated.Javid responded to the details of the imam’s past tweets by saying he “should practise what he preaches. Words do indeed have consequences.”Thakar initially came under scrutiny for having stood as a Labour council candidate and briefly working for the party. He had said on the programme that whichever candidate won would have “no mandate” from the general public, and asked them: “When will you do the right thing and call a general election?” The BBC said it had known Thakar had done some work for Labour before putting him on the programme. But more controversy ensued when it emerged that he had tweeted: “Hitler’s abuse of the term nationalism is, to me a nationalist, the most harmful part of his legacy.”Thakar apologised for any offence caused but said he was making a sarcastic comment about a speech made by Candace Owens, a conservative US activist, in which she said: “Whenever we say ‘nationalism’ the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler. You know, he was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.”Speaking about Patel, a BBC spokesperson said: “We carried out background research into the online and social media profiles of all our questioners for last night’s debate. After the debate, one inidual reactivated a public Twitter account he had previously deactivated, whose tweets were not visible during our research period. Had we been aware of the views he expressed there, he would not have been selected.”The BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Nicky Campbell apologised for having Patel on his programme on Wednesday morning. “His social media comments have been extremely disturbing. We should have checked. We didn’t. I’m sorry,” he said.Patel told BBC Gloucester he did not remember all of his tweets, adding: “I have not criticised the Jewish community … criticism of Israel is not the same as criticism of Jews.”​"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1669c0e61aa0f2396a318bcb5d85874191a6986/0_193_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea77229ec4bd2d252ca0fe1e3b1b7c0","title":"the whole thing was dismal readers on the tory tv debate","story":"Candidates for the Conservative leadership took part in a debate on Tuesday – readers have been reacting in the commentsMost of us will have worked with or for a leader who has had the ability to inspire, to motivate, to explain, to prioritise, to delegate, to coach, to be authentic, to involve, to be intellectually agile, to set out a compelling vision and to make following herhim an honour. None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

For that reason I will do everything within my power to defend myself against any such false accusations.The TIU, however, had earlier refused to confirm or deny whether they had been asked to investigate the case, an information vacuum that did little to help Lopez’s initial protestation of innocence.Lopez revealed Murray “didn’t say anything” to him about the stories, adding: “This thing can happen to every one of us. He’s happy to play with me this week. I think we can play great, and he’s been training normal. Andy is one of the best players in the history of tennis, and I’m very lucky to be playing with him.”López also confided that he had been falsely accused in a British newspaper 16 years ago of throwing a match when he retired ill against Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of a tournament in Long Island. “I saw the article. I went to my lawyers. They had to publish another article saying that I was not involved in any match fixing at that time.”He said of his win against Fucsovics: “It’s not easy when you find yourself in an article saying that you might be a match fixer. But I believe that I didn’t do anything wrong, no? I have to deal with a lot of tweets regarding the issue, but I was just trying to just focus on the match today. It was difficult for me to play and I’m very happy that I went through a difficult situation when I was a set and a break down and I made it.”On a day when rain again wrecked the schedule, discussions switched to the wildcards Wimbledon announced for the championships, which start on 1 July. There was bemusement that Marco Baghdatis, 139 in the world, again is ushered into the main draw, but celebration for the 19-year-old Paul Jubb, of Hull.“I don’t think he was worth a wildcard,” John Lloyd said of Baghdatis, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2006 and quarter-finalist the following year. “He’s not a big enough name and what he did was a long time ago.”Jubb’s wildcard – alongside the 20-year-old Jay Clarke and evergreen James Ward – gives the British presence in the men’s draw a patina of respectability, in support of Evans, Kyle Edmund and Cameron Norrie.The Hull teenager, not known widely outside the game’s hardcore, grabbed headlines briefly last month when he became the first British player to win the highest honour in American college tennis, the NCAA title. Norrie, who also played college tennis, said, “He’s solid and a good athlete with a good serve. I think it’s a hell of an achievement.”Jubb’s parents died when he was young and he was brought up by his grandmother before winning a scholarship that has transformed his young career. He will resume studies after Wimbledon and has indicated he will turn professional in May next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e288b6e94926a31c108e42c516712bc1e5a05eae/0_51_1269_761/master/1269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c10921c2f9e2e5dfb1cea9f59f4b5d57","title":"eoin morgan inspiring england cricket world cup joe root","story":"Eoin Morgan claimed his six-hitting spree against Afghanistan went beyond his wildest dreams but, for Joe Root, who watched all but one of the 17 record-breaking blows from the non-striker’s end, the captain’s assault came as no surprise.Root happily provided support to Morgan during England’s one-sided victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday, scoring 88 from 82 balls in classic fashion and contrasting style to the jaw-dropping 71-ball 148 that belied the captain’s recent back spasms.Asked if he thought Morgan had such an innings in him, Root replied: “Yes. Definitely. A lot of the time he will play in that manner, very selflessly, potentially going a little bit too hard, because he wants to set the example. He’s always been capable of doing it. It’s great to see him doing it on this stage, in a World Cup. I’m trying to find the right word to describe his innings. It was just phenomenal really, unbelievable ball striking and it completely took the game away.”Root contributed 43 to the pair’s third-wicket stand of 189 and felt his role in that situation was simply to get his partner back on strike, something he did 17 times during their 16.5 overs together at the crease.Root is the keystone to England’s batting unit – their top-scorer so far in the competition with 367 runs – and he fancies Morgan’s savage innings can truly inspire the team before Friday’s meeting with Sri Lanka at Headingley.He continued: “It’s not even like Old Trafford is a small ground. It’s a fantastic achievement, especially for someone with a dodgy back. It makes you wonder how bad it actually was. But it’s a really good sign for the group having the captain in that sort of form. It gives the dressing room a huge amount of confidence.”It is not only Morgan’s bat that has England upbeat at present. The pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood continues to trouble opponents, with the pair not only sharing 21 wickets at this World Cup but also offering significant physical threat.This was underlined by the bouncer that struck Afghanistan’s top-scorer, Hashmatullah Shahidi, on the head and broke his helmet. As well as raising questions about the ICC’s concussion protocol – Shahidi said he defied doctors orders by batting on, hoping not to worry his mother watching on TV back home – it demonstrated Morgan’s ruthless side in asking Wood to send down another bouncer immediately.Wood, who was affected by the blow but duly delivered on his captain’s orders, was keen to stress that once a batsman resumes, the tactic is entirely fair game. “I was concerned when I first hit him, it was a bit of a bad blow,” he said. “Then it’s out of my hands really, you have to let the medical staff do their thing. I checked he was all right, said ‘Are you OK’, then it was back into game mode.“Morgy wanted me to fire another few down. That’s what the captain wants, you listen to orders and now that he’s all right, it’s game time again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382e96ddc7bdfdd9db010c2dd4920e8791f2326d/0_26_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57e2bf8fe8f36bbe21641dd7addad296","title":"new zealand v south africa cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"46th over (of 49): New Zealand 225-5 (Williamson 90, De Grandhomme 58) – target 242.

You don’t come across many Colins these days, I wonder if the name is as dead as Gary. “Excellent game described by Abhijato Sensarma,” says Brian Withington, “which immediately begs the question of what is a par score? I suspect that the optimum approach is a randomised ‘mixed’ strategy and think this will on average secure a 50 ball innings scoring 160 runs (ignoring extras). But it’s been a very long time since my maths degree days. I think a modified Duckworth Lewis could readily be developed to overcome restricted innings when teacher stops play ...”Er, there’s no such thing as a par score? Every ball on it’s merits, if you can whack it for six you do. 45th over (of 49): New Zealand 216-5 (Williamson 88, De Grandhomme 52) – target 242. 31 needed off 30 balls - you’re New Zealand, you’d’ve took it, as Ryan Giggs would say. Is there a provision in English for words featuring two contractions? Can we call it a giggstraction? After two dots, a cross-seamer that’s short and wide - Williamson runs it down without having to think, so De Grandhomme thinks he can do likewise and misses ... close. Next, a bazzing yorker that he does really well to handle ... then brings up his fifty with an effortless - for him - swat over wide mid-on for a one-bounce four. That’s brilliant - he’s wearing this pressure like he was sewn into it. 44th over (of 49): New Zealand 211-5 (Williamson 87, De Grandhomme 48) – target 242. Williamson takes a single, then De Grandhomme has a go at a slower one from Phehlukwayo and edges four - he’s earned all of that with the day he’s had. A single to midwicket them gives Williamson a go, and he pulls for two, after which, hilarity. Williamson swats, Ngidi drops a dolly ... and it’s a no ball anyway. Two more to the total, plus one from the free hit and another one - 12 from the over, barely any risk, and that’s huge at this stage. 43rd over (of 49): New Zealand 199-5 (Williamson 82, De Grandhomme 42) – target 242. Morris replaces Rabada and hurls himself into it immediately as is his wont. In elegising him, Mark Nicholas praises his chutzpah, pronounced “shutzpah” - someone help him with his Yiddish, please - the ch is guttual. In my lawyering days, someone tried it with a regular ch, then explained what it meant to me for double points he also liked F1. New Zealand take three from this over, bumping the required rate up to 7.16, but it’s impossible to seethe Saffers winning this unless they get some wickets. 42nd over (of 49): New Zealand 196-5 (Williamson 80, De Grandhomme 41) – target 242. Phehlukwayo returns, and his team need something, anything. De Grandhomme bangs him to cover for a single and they batsmen take one off each of the next five balls too. There aren’t many men in the world you’d pick ahead of Williamson to shepherd this chase, and he now has 3000 runs in 50-over cricket. 41st over (of 49): New Zealand 190-5 (Williamson 77, De Grandhomme 38) – target 242. Hi again and thanks Tom. We hoped for an arse-nipper and that’s what we’ve got - techno techno techno techno. And this is another terrific over of World Cup CricketTM. Willaimson sneaks a leg bye off Rabada and at short midwicket, Miller has a shy ... they practise for this ... he misses! South Africa have not chapped their chances today, and when you’re defending 241, you have to. Grandhomme then rubs it in by edging a four and knucking a single - what a game he’s having. Brunel, Curie and Aqua have nothing on this tribute to human ingenuity from Abhijato Sensarma:“As most of the young Indian people like me spend a considerable amount of time in school, and are confined to the four corners of the classroom for most of the school hours’ duration, many innovative ways of playing the sport through strange mediums have been adapted. Without any doubt, the most famous of these adaptations is book cricket, which is usually enjoyed best with a Charles Dickens, much to the disapproval of the English teacher. Then, there is the version of the game which is played with the help of a calculator, much to the disapproval of the mathematics teacher. The most recent reincarnation is ‘hand cricket,’ which is, not so surprisingly, met with disapproval from all the teachers.The game is pretty basic and can be played anywhere. It requires both of the players to throw down their hands (like rock paper scissors), forming a number with their fingers at the same time. To curb the problem of showing six (which requires both hands to be shown), just the thumb is used.After the toss is conducted using any arbitrary method, the formatting of the game varies greatly, depending on the region and school one is in, like the number of wickets and overs, as well as format. But, as the history teacher often says (albeit during a different discussion), ‘the basic elements tend to remain same everywhere’. The bowler needs to guess and throw down the same number as the batter. If he does, a dismissal occurs if not, the number shown by the batsman (ranging from 1 to 6) is added to the total.Be it an international match on the pitch, or a one-wicket-per-side game for winning the rights to pursue a friendship with a common crush, the spirit remains the same. And as every lover of the game knows, it will hurt no one if the core of the game never changes, be it a Test, a T20, or a friendly encounter of ‘hand cricket’.”40th over (of 49): New Zealand 184-5 (Williamson 77, De Grandhomme 33) – target 242. Powerplay three is initiated, and Ngidi returns – and returns well, varying his pace and movement (and also because his hamstring is a little knacked) and offering nothing. One Williamson single is all it yields.Unmistakeable echoes of NZ’s win over Bangladesh here – tight in the field, surviving a middle-overs wobble with the bat before easing (ish) home.And with that, I’ll hand you back to Daniel to guide you home. Thanks for your company and emails.39th over (of 49): New Zealand 183-5 (Williamson 76, De Grandhomme 33) – target 242. De Grandhomme’s taking this away from South Africa now, he’s onto a short one from Phehlukwayo like a rash and pulls him into the stand for SIX more. He adds another pair of twos.“Tom, you posit that South Africa needed a wicket in the next 5 overs, and next minute Neesham is gone,” marvels Danielle Tolson, soliciting lottery number info. “Any other suggestive superpowers you possess may be welcome. I wonder if the Black Caps should have swapped out Henry for Southee \u0026amp Neesham for Nicholls today given the way the game has played out so far (Mike Hesson recommended this for the game against India that didn’t happen, even just to give them same game time, but might have been more useful for a bunch of reasons in this one).”38th over (of 49): New Zealand 173-5 (Williamson 76, De Grandhomme 23) – target 242. Close! De Grandhomme scoops Tahir just short of the man at short midwicket, Miller. And then – worse! – a drop, as De Grandhomme similarly misreads and flicks wide of a ing Miller, who can only palm it away. It was a tough chance, but a pivotal one. Tahir finishes with 0-33 from 10 – an excellent effort. He’s heartily cheered by the crowd.37th over (of 49): New Zealand 169-5 (Williamson 74, De Grandhomme 21) – target 242. New Zealand look back on course now. Phehulukwayo returns and De Grandhomme swivels and flicks his second ball into the Hollies Stand – an easy six. Williamson, meanwhile, can anchor this home now – as long as his colleagues don’t do anything daft.36th over (of 49): New Zealand 160-5 (Williamson 72, De Grandhomme 14) – target 242. Tahir continues, and no boundaries are attempted, but plenty of singles are scurried, one of which almost does for Williamson, who’s almost out off the last ball of the over. Gone if he’d hit.35th over (of 49): New Zealand 154-5 (Williamson 70, De Grandhomme 10) – target 242. De Grandhomme drives square for one before Williamson gets hold of one for the first time in a while, a merciless pull to the long-on boundary for four.Kali Srikanth wants to talk tapping: “Well it is the equivalent of tennis players bouncing the balls quintessentially infinite times before serving.It is for the same reason as to “get into a flowrhythm” or rather a soothing ritual.” So does Olly Horne: “I think tapping the bat is useful for convincing yourself 1) you’re stood in the right place, and 2) your bat isn’t at a funny angle in your hand. That, and at least you’re hitting ‘something’!”While Howard Roberts at Edgbaston is fulminating against the currently malfunctioning scoreboard. “If the atmosphere is flat it is because the crowd don’t know the detail of what is happening,” he says. “In a tight game - unforgivable. Apparently Uber available though.” Well that’s the main thing – the gig economy purrs on.34th over (of 49): New Zealand 148-5 (Williamson 65, De Grandhomme 9) – target 242. It could be a game of attack and counterattack now, a development acknowledged by the return of Tahir from the City End. The batsmen manage to rotate the strike comfortably enough – three from it.New Zealand need 94 from 15 overs – more than six an over.33rd over (of 49): New Zealand 145-5 (Williamson 63, De Grandhomme 8) – target 242. Williamson drives uppishly at Morris but it falls short of the man at mid-off, and they nab a single, but Morris earns a deserved third wicket when his cross-seamer is edged by the left-hander to Amla, who es forward to snaffle. De Grandhomme, excellent with the ball earlier, is the new man in though, and he begins with a statement two and a crunching four over midwicket. Two more ensue and this could go any way now.Morris breaks a sticky partnership, edging to Amla who es low to take it comfortably. And drinks.32nd over (of 49): New Zealand 136-4 (Williamson 62, Neesham 23) – target 242. I’d like to see how England get on on a sticky surface like this – scoring really is easy, and it’s not beyond the bounds that they’d have a Pakistan-in-the-Champions Trophy-style horror show on it, though their attack and tactics are better now than two years ago. Williamson edges, but edges hard, at Phehlukwayo and it careers down to the fine leg boundary for four. Neesham plays his best shot so far too, on-driving a full delivery stylishly for four. A much more productive over“It is 5 AM on a wintry early morning in Wellington,” scene-sets Hari Shankar. “The kettle is on. Have the fire going. My dog is staring at me with displeasure. Even the birds are quiet. Nervous start for a lot of kiwis today. Will this go to the wire like that memorable Auckland encounter?” I think it will, yes. Though South Africa need a wicket in the next five overs.31st over (of 49): New Zealand 125-4 (Williamson 57, Neesham 19) – target 242. An energetic piece of fielding from Amla denies Williamson a run with a dab to backward point. This is good pressure, and good fielding, and Rabada ends the over with a half-hearted appeal for a catch behind, but the review is spurned. There have been none in this innings.30th over (of 49): New Zealand 124-4 (Williamson 56, Neesham 19) – target 242. A breather for Tahir, a return for the mildly inconsistent Phehlukwayo, who begins with a rather rancid wide down legside. Though Williamson struggles a tad to pick his slower ball, and essays a rare and ugly hoik and miss at one of them. Another unconvincing inside-edge brings two. That was Williamson’s least convincing over of his innings – he didn’t middle anything.29th over (of 49): New Zealand 119-4 (Williamson 53, Neesham 18) – target 242. A second spell for Rabada and he begins with a tightish just-back-of-a-length over that goes for two ones and a two. This is going the distance.“I’m back,” roars Kanishk Srinivasan, “and with a more existential question for you and the OBO-spectators. Why do batsmen tap their bats as the bowler makes their run-up? I watched all my batting heroes do it as I was growing up, so I did the same, but I never actually knew why it was necessary. It came to the point where I found the sound of the tapping bat soothing. I’d be happy with any answers (humorous or informative).” Yep, it was complete orthodoxy, back in the day, though Graham Gooch was my idol as a kid and he had a high tap-less backlift28th over (of 49): New Zealand 115-4 (Williamson 50, Neesham 17) – target 242. Neesham takes on Tahir properly for the first time, hitting a half-volley with the spin over midwicket for four, and Williamson moves to a vital half-century by the time the over’s done. Does anyone make batting look so easy?27th over (of 49): New Zealand 109-4 (Williamson 47, Neesham 12) – target 242. Ngidi is doing a really important job here, denying New Zealand an end from which they can cut loose. Two singles and a neat clip through midwicket from a well-read slower ball complete the over.26th over (of 49): New Zealand 105-4 (Williamson 46, Neesham 11) – target 242. Tahir ties Neesham in venture-scout standard knots with a devilish off-break which whistles past the left-hander. It’s the highlight of another parsimonious over.It was always bound to happen. Alastair Horne nominates “the Australians finally getting caught” as his moment of the decade. Say Alastair, have you met my good friend Russell?25th over (of 49): New Zealand 103-4 (Williamson 45, Neesham 10) – target 242. An excellent maiden. Ngidi flummoxes Williamson with an in-swinging slower ball that brushes past the batsman’s midriff. It’s followed by a smattering of good shots for no run. South Africa have four men in on the one on the offside, and they’re all stopping runs. We’re halfway through New Zealand’s reply and they’re not in Bon Jovi territory yet.Validation from our man Abhijato, re Perera: “I agree with you, Tom. This is the perfect definition as well as representation of cricket from the past decade - the guts, the glory, the upsets, the resurgence of Test cricket, and the perennial joy of being the viewer in the background as your heroes pull off impossible feats. What a beautiful sport this is!” That it is.24th over (of 49): New Zealand 103-4 (Williamson 45, Neesham 10) – target 242. Tahir treats himself to a celebrappeal against Neesham, but De Kock cautions that it pitched outside leg, which it did. It’s all pressure though, as is the fine stop at extra-cover that denies a crunching Neesham drive a run. Just the one from the spinner’s fifth over.23rd over (of 49): New Zealand 102-4 (Williamson 44, Neesham 10) – target 242. Ngidi replaces Morris after a superb spell from the latter. Strike rotation takes New Zealand into three figures, but Ngidi offers no freebies. Five singles.India news: Dhawan is officially out of the World Cup – a horrible blow for him and India, though no team probably has more batting depth. Rishabh Pant is confirmed as the replacement.22nd over (of 49): New Zealand 97-4 (Williamson 41, Neesham 8) – target 242. This is a high-calibre battle: one of the wiliest spinners in the world against one of the most accomplished batsmen. Williamson is being pretty respectful, though you wonder whether Neesham’s more the type to go ‘what the hell’ and try to launch it. No sign of it yet, though. A watchful three from the over.21st over (of 49): New Zealand 94-4 (Williamson 39 Neesham 7) – target 242. Williamson attempts to reassert himself with a lovely on-drive for four and the runs flow a bit more freely again after the recent mood-changing jitters. The next dozen or so overs could decide this match. It’s beautifully poise. I’m wary of saying “intriguing” because that smacks a little too much, in cricket parlance, of “Nothing much is happening but it’s fascinating, honest.” It is fascinating, mind.20th over (of 49): New Zealand 86-4 (Williamson 33 Neesham 5) – target 242. “Now that the format-talk has been guillotined,” writes Surendranath Halder, “let us discuss something else - what is the most iconic cricketing moment of this decade so far? For me, it was Dhoni’s World Cup winning six. What about you, as well as others?” To be Anglo-centric I might go for Stokes at Cape Town in 2016, or perhaps Perera’s remarkable, unforeseen match-winning turn for Sri Lanka in South Africa earlier this year.Tahir sends down another very tidy over, that yields only two singles.19th over (of 49): New Zealand 84-4 (Williamson 32 Neesham 0) – target 242. The tables continue to turn as the left-handed Latham edges behind to become the third wicket to fall for eight runs. He has the incoming left-hander, Jimmy Neesham, in trouble straight away with another teasing away swinger slanted across him. It’s a seamer’s paradise at the moment, though Neesham likes to have a go and is offered room to square-drive for four, which he does.“Can something be high on quality, intriguing, as well as boring, often simultaneously?” asks OB Jato, speaking my language. “Because going by what we’ve seen so far in this paradoxical World Cup, that is exactly what could happen over the next few weeks!”Again! South Africa are in the ascendancy now – Morris hits the corridor of uncertainty with unerring menace and Latham edges limply behind.18th over (of 49): New Zealand 80-3 (Williamson 32 Latham 1) – target 242. Williamson edges wide of slip for four as Tahir finds deceptive loop and bounce, and the captain was pretty discomfited by that. And also by another tossed-up googly outside off that he swishes at and misses. This is compelling stuff. Four from the over, but Tahir won’t mind too much about that.17th over (of 49): New Zealand 76-3 (Williamson 28, Latham 1) – target 242. And another! Morris changes ends and induces a lazy flick to the keeper from Taylor. Encouraging for the quick bowler, who sends down a fine probing over locating movement and swing, and for Tahir, who has something to aim at at the other end.A change of ends for Morris, and another change of luck. He strangles Taylor down the legside and a potential matchwinner is back in the shed. Do we have a game now?16th over (of 49): New Zealand 74-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 1) – target 242. Time for Tahir, not without reason. The spinner comes on at the City End but Ross Taylor is at him smartly, advancing to get off the mark before it bounces. But a textbook googly has Williamson in bother as he dobs it uppishly back to the bowler but the ball drops just short of him. An encouraging sttart.15th over (of 49): New Zealand 72-2 (Williamson 26) – target 242. Phehlukwayo overpitches, Williamson punishes, with an effortless cover drive to the boundary, and then makes it eight from two with an emphatic swivel-pull. This is costly for South Africa – but then they get a freakish stroke of luck, as Guptill treads on his stumps.In true union conference style, we’re going to guillotine the format debate now and ask the proposer to offer his right of reply. Over to you Abhijato:The format was just an abstract idea I had over dinner a few days ago, and I am overwhelmed by the reaction. Here I go, then, to add a few points of my own to some of the correspondence - Both Nick and Kanishk have pointed out quite a valid cause for concern. I was trying to tie-in the overall spirit of the ODI World Championship (first edition starts from later this year) with the World Cup better than the current form of its existence. The teams in G1 would have played the best cricket and are merely getting rewarded now for their consistency over the last four years. As for the matches being semi-conscious, it’s a valid concern. The same phenomenon might happen in this 2019 edition, since qualification is almost secure for the top four halfway through. But the incentive of getting the best spots for the knockouts will mean quality matches are still played. Also, many thanks to Mr Baxter. He is indeed right about the typo, as well as the format. Even I myself am not sure about this!What a strange one. Guptill rocks back to pull into the onside, but then slides backwards as he sets off for the run and careers into his stumps. He’d looked totally unperturbed until then. 14th over (of 49): New Zealand 61-1 (Guptill 35, Williamson 15) – target 242. Morris sends a beautiful outswinger off the seam and past Williamson’s outside edge, before a bit of sloppiness on the boundary from Rabada turns a one into a two.

That 2003 stunt backfired, but the stupefaction quotient is high in his touring show Real or Magic? which showcases Blaine’s magic as well as the lengths to which he can push his body. So too is the squirm quotient – I spent a fair chunk of the show looking at anything but the stage.Squeamish viewers (that’s me!) will wonder how anyone could be entertained by the spectacle of a man piercing his biceps with a metal spike. Or, for that matter, vomiting up pints of water on demand to extinguish a fire. But even if the horror is sometimes a painful watch, the point it’s making – Blaine’s supernatural command of his body – is abundantly made.At the interval, an amateur hypnotist beside me claimed you can trance yourself into not bleeding. That would certainly explain Blaine’s hangdog demeanour: if he’s in a trance, no wonder he’s not perky. I found that this kind of anti-showmanship makes the gruesome moments – stitching his lips together, say – feel even more confrontational. Then there’s the act two showstopper, when Blaine submerges himself in a water tank for 10 minutes without breathing. The drama requires cranking up, with live commentary, a countdown and some children loosed on stage to commune with Blaine through the glass.The closing moments are the most human, as Blaine, recovering his puff, shares his belief that “we can always be amazed at the human body and what it does.” These feats of imperviousness and endurance risk overshadowing the actual magic tricks – inducing symbiosis in two unrelated audience members guessing which jigsaw piece among 2,000 that his volunteer (Spider-Man star Tom Holland, as it happens) will choose. But each of them are astonishing, in their less showy way. No one throws eggs there’s a clamorous standing ovation. • At Eventim Apollo, London, on 19 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b8080bade4eb4231fe1e74b7463f362a0306230/173_678_5510_3306/master/5510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=470802bbe65591bf3884237c31aec5e3","title":"indira varma interview game of thrones present laughter","story":"She was ruthless Ellaria in the TV epic. As she appears in a Noël Coward comedy, the actor talks about her dreams of returning to mime – and why sticking with her name may have hurt her career‘People always talk about that scream,” says Indira Varma over salad and strawberries at the Old Vic theatre. The actor is recalling the howl she lets out in season four of Game of Thrones, after her lover Oberyn has his eyes gouged out by a hulking brute called the Mountain. Splatter flies and we cut to her character, Ellaria, who gives a blood-curdling screech.What personal demons, I wonder, was Varma summoning to produce that? “It was the last thing they shot that day,” she recalls. “I had one go. We were losing the light. So it’s like…” She draws a breath and drags out an expletive until her voice squeaks. Then she says with a shrug: “You have to deliver.”Varma, who has triumphed in Shakespeare, Shaw, Pinter and Hare, is now starring in Noël Coward’s Present Laughter at the London theatre. But she’s still best known as ruthless Ellaria, who we first meet embarking on a foursome with Oberyn and is usually to be seen writhing at his side, or scheming with her Sand Snake daughters.In Matthew Warchus’s production of Coward’s 1939 comedy, Andrew Scott dons theatre’s most famous dressing gown to play the tousled matinee idol Garry Essendine. Varma is Liz, who never got round to orcing Garry and manages his career with utmost pragmatism. This involves navigating his dalliances with debutantes and, in a fresh gender-switch, with predatory male actor Joe (Joanna in Coward’s original).Coolheaded, elegant, shrewd: there’s a hint of Liz to Varma, who illustrates points with gestures placed as carefully as her words are chosen. “Liz is the one person who is direct with Garry, so he values that relationship. He is pulled in every direction by flattery and adulation. The thing about Liz that I love is she walked away from the marriage. She’s really powerful.”This is Varma’s second Coward – she did The Vortex at the Donmar in 2002. I presume she saw his plays growing up in well-heeled Bath? Apparently not. “But I used to queue up for the Theatre Royal because they did £1 standing room tickets. I saw Lettice and Lovage with Maggie Smith. It blew my mind.” What else excited her? “People laugh but I love mime. I feel sad because I’ve kind of let it go.” Her career took her through different doors, she says. I picture Varma shutting out Marcel Marceau in a sad little mime. She might find a way back in, she insists – “a cat flap into that world”.Varma, who is 45, was raised in an arty home by her Swiss mother (a graphic designer) and Indian father (an illustrator). Were they keen on her having an acting career? “My dad wasn’t. He’d just throw at me, ‘You should be a doctor.’ Utterly ludicrous. I was crap at science.” She went off to Rada. How was that? After a slight sigh, she talks instead about the fun of acting as a child: “There’s something so pure about being able to mess about, where there are no expectations.” She then remembers Rada as “great but quite intimidating”. There is a pause. “We all go through moments of self-doubt and going, ‘I’m the mistake.’ Or, ‘Maybe I’m not right for this. I don’t fit into what I think the theatre world is. I’m not useful to that world yet.’ To begin with, I felt like that.”She graduated in 1995 and Mira Nair cast her as a servant turned courtesan in Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, inspired by the ancient Hindu text. Nair was impressed by her “wilful gaze and imperiousness” and the film, shot in central India, was a “baptism of fire” says Varma. At 21, she hadn’t trained for film nor grown up on movies. Here she was debuting in a leading role requiring considerable nudity. “It was the first time I had to lose weight. I’d prided myself on being me – take me as I am! But the reality is that you’re there to serve the material. Suddenly you’re having to change yourself a little to fit this ideal.” She lost confidence and grew angry. But did she have a lot of trust in Nair as a director? “Yeah – and as a woman,” she says.I ask if Kama Sutra narrowed the roles she was offered. “Oh God, yeah,” she says twice. “My name’s Indira Varma. It’s an Indian name. And I think, you know, if I had a Spanish name, people would maybe think I was Spanish. If I had a North African name, also. If I had an English name, I might be seen differently.” At drama school, one teacher suggested she change it but she thought: “I’m going to forge a path for those with foreign names!” Another encouraged her to keep it. “I’ve always been torn by that decision. I’m still in the business and I’m here at the Old Vic, but there have been moments where I’ve thought: bloody hell, I’ve missed out on that because actually they liked the tape and then someone went, ‘Bit too Asian – not really what we’re looking for.’”At Rada, Varma had been cast as an old man – “and as a parrot!” But after Kama Sutra, she says, “all I was being offered was Indian exotica, women who take their clothes off”. She concentrated on theatre, playing Phoebe in As You Like It (opposite Stephen Mangan) and Bianca in Othello (directed by Sam Mendes). She had the distinction of not just doing Pinter but also starring with and being directed by the great playwright. She does an impressive Pinter impersonation, recreating his words of advice: “Nothing you do is wrong.” She laughs and explains he wasn’t talking “to me personally, daaarling! But if you are truthful, then nothing you do is wrong. That is the most liberating thing you can say to an actor.”Back on screen, Varma was a hoot in matching Burberry cap and bikini in Bride and Prejudice, Gurinder Chadha’s Bollywood Austen makeover, looking on aloof in the Caroline Bingley role. On telly, in the satirical Broken News, she was newsreader Melanie Bellamy, frantically pacing around a studio. In Luther, she played humanitarian lawyer Zoe, whose grace contrasts with her explosive detective husband (Idris Elba). She was superb in Patrick Melrose, too, wracked with concern for Melrose’s mother Eleanor as they share a Ferris wheel.This summer, she appears in Official Secrets, a film about GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun. She plays Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty who invited Varma to tea at the House of Lords. “I look nothing like her,” she says, “and she’s half my size.” Varma has just done a TV pilot, For Life, playing a gay prison warden. Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is involved. “He’s done some music for it!” she laughs. “Really cool!”Her industry, Varma says, requires actors to be Teflon on the outside but able to access their vulnerabilities in performance. “It’s a paradox.” She aspires to something similar when performing: “I’m in control of it but also not giving a fuck, so anything can happen. That tension is what it’s all about.” Does she carry characters around with her during rehearsals? “Prior to having a child, it was all-consuming.” Now Varma has a daughter with actor Colin Tierney, she switches off more easily – although they’ve been telling her to stop talking so loudly, reminding her she’s not on the Old Vic stage yet.Several Thrones stars are doing theatre in London this summer: Gwendoline Christie is playing Titania, Julian Glover is doing Tennessee Williams, Faye Marsay is at the Donmar. Did she meet many of the TV juggernaut’s huge cast? “When I came in, in season four, our storyline had a wedding which meant everybody was there. It was really lovely.” What did her audition require? “I just had to, like, prowl around a little bit.” An actor friend had randomly emailed to ask why she wasn’t in the show. Varma thought: “Yeah, why am I not?” She emailed another friend who worked on it and got the audition.Why is it so popular? She talks about clever storytelling, power struggles, then admits: “Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t watched the whole thing to be honest.” But she praises the Shakespearean richness in how characters contradict themselves. Varma’s real Shakespeares include a Titus Andronicus at the Globe that supposedly had audiences fainting. “Often they didn’t pass out in the gory bits,” she says. “The language is sort of more shocking.”She remembers doing Twelfth Night and the power of Andrew Aguecheek’s “I was adored once too” line. “They call it a heart-stopping line. At both the matinee and the evening, a person had a heart attack in that scene. Somebody who’s a bit of a fool, who says stupid things, suddenly has one line that is profound. I did The Vertical Hour with David Hare. He said if you want to say something important, make a joke beforehand. I think Coward does that.”Present Laughter’s title comes from Twelfth Night. Coward’s play was first called Sweet Sorrow but that was considered too gloomy for a wartime audience. “I think Matthew is trying to go for the Sweet Sorrow version,” says Varma before breaking out in a smile: “But there’s definitely laughter!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01f9dfd703e2db8f0248b35d7843462354d3a9f/0_1117_2917_1749/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5972012bc10bcc1aeb048b2d9548e53a","title":"how eye gaze technology brought creativity back into an artists life","story":"Sarah Ezekiel explains how accessible technology helped her paint and recover after a motor neurone disease diagnosis Sarah Ezekiel loves colour. Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Now series like Chambers are getting axed after a season. What is behind this lurch into ruthlessness?By anyone’s standards, Chambers died young. Just 56 short days after debuting on Netflix, it has now been consigned to the bin. “Chambers will not return for a second season,” Nexflix said in a statement on Tuesday. “We’re grateful to creator and showrunner Leah Rachel for bringing this story to us”.Why was Chambers cancelled so abruptly? It could be down to any number of reasons, although they can probably all be boiled down to a) it was bad and b) nobody watched it. The supernatural thriller, about the recipient of a heart in a transplant who starts experiencing troubling side-effects, was unpleasant, listlessly acted (even though it featured Uma Thurman) and had a title so pointlessly nebulous that it literally could have been about anything, from bedrooms to courtrooms to toilets. All in all, Chambers’s demise was inevitable.But the fact that it happened so quickly is still a surprise. This never used to be Netflix’s style. Quite the opposite, in fact it wasn’t such a long time ago that Netflix gained a reputation as the least ruthless content provider around. This was the platform, remember, that gave three entire seasons to Hemlock Grove and Bloodline, and two seasons to Flaked. It was the platform that let Chelsea rumble on for 120 episodes. Nobody asked for those shows. Few people liked those shows. But Netflix renewed them anyway.In fairness, it has got a little more ruthless of late. Now it doesn’t even wait until people are sick of its shows before binning them off. The abrupt cancellations of Sense8, Santa Clarita Diet and One Day at a Time provoked all kinds of appalled fan reactions. But still, hacking down a new show before it has a chance to find a proper audience seems quite callous.Worse, it seems like the sort of thing Prime Video would do the platform that gave Jean-Claude Van Johnson a splashy launch 10 days before Christmas 2017 and then cancelled 17 days after New Year’s Day 2018 the platform that launched Sneaky Pete’s third season in a blaze of glory on 10 May then axed it without a proper ending on 4 June the platform that worked overtime to launch and cancel the second season of The Tick in just two and a half months.Netflix has been this trigger happy before – Gypsy, despite starring Naomi Watts, was cancelled 50 days after it launched in 2017, and Friends From College was cancelled just 39 days after its second season premiered – but the abrupt cancellation of Chambers should make producers uneasy. This, it seems, is simply how the world now works. Netflix has such an overflowing glut of content that it’s basically float or drown. If people don’t find your show immediately, if it doesn’t inspire recaps and deep-es and memes within hours of launching, it’s done for. A slow-burn word-of-mouth series simply cannot cut it on a platform that lives and dies by its ability to constantly serve up the hot new thing.This is part of Netflix’s design. When it just had a handful of original shows, House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, there was more onus on keeping people interested with new episodes. But the platform now debuts hundreds of new series worldwide every year, which means it can be almost impossible for a struggling show to gain an audience in the face of such a tidal wave. Additionally, Netflix shows tend to become less economically viable after a couple of seasons – a report earlier this year suggested that renewal bonuses for third seasons escalate “sometimes from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars” – which can become prohibitively expensive when you’re dropping 600 new shows a year. In other words, new and cheap is better than old and expensive.The argument exists that Netflix doesn’t actually cancel anything. Chambers – like Hemlock Grove, The Get Down, The Good Cop and All About the Washingtons and all its other weird failures – will exist forever somewhere within Netflix’s elaborate system of submenus, waiting to be discovered by an excited new generation. But that isn’t really the case. As soon as a show if officially over, it’s only natural for viewers to lose interest. I ducked out of Chambers after a few episodes, but now there isn’t a chance that I’ll watch the rest of it. If Netflix doesn’t have confidence in it, then nor do I. Also, it was really bad. I mean, my God."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a0c32f9fe192c847ca6599b7559c3fb26b4d677/0_26_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50b6555105fb656351001b75928926bb","title":"rollout of compulsory civic service for young people in france sparks criticisms","story":"First images from trial show ‘nationalist nightmare’ of teenagers lined up in uniformThe first images from a trial of Emmanuel Macron’s compulsory national service for French teenagers have sparked criticism on the left that youngsters are made to wear uniforms, attend early morning flag ceremonies and repeatedly sing the national anthem.Macron had caused surprise during his presidential campaign in 2017 when he promised to introduce compulsory national service to give girls and boys “a direct experience” of military life.The project was then tweaked to become compulsory civic service – with input from the military but without any dealings with weapons – in which youngsters would learn about first aid, self-defence and republican values as way of bringing “social cohesion” to a fractured nation.This week, the first trials began with teenagers from different backgrounds boarding together for two weeks – in buildings including boarding schools, holiday villages and university campuses – where they would take part in debates about society, learn map reading and first aid, and be taught about gender equality and how to recognise fake news, before a second phase of two weeks volunteering with a charity or local government.But when the first images emerged of scores of youngsters in immaculate navy blue uniforms, lined up army-style and singing the national anthem at early morning flag ceremonies, critics on the left denounced the exercise as too costly and a type of forced nationalism that should not be made compulsory.Images of youths watching the France-Nigeria women’s football World Cup match while standing in a perfect line with a government minister sparked criticism on social media. Concern was also raised as some volunteers briefly fell ill in the heat while lined up watching a ceremony in honour of Gen Charles de Gaulle in Normandy.One high-school union, the UNL, which has opposed the project, said: “Is it in keeping with the times to constrain young people to go and sing under a flag at 8am in the morning? This universal national service must not be made compulsory.”Céline Malaisé, a Communist regional councillor, tweeted: “This old nationalist nightmare repulses me.” She likened it to “denying the free will of young people, their engagement, their critical spirit” and called it a hypocritical “masquerade” while not enough resources were being placed in schools.The Socialist politician Boris Vallaud said the estimated cost of more than €1.5bn (£1.3bn), once the service becomes compulsory in 2026, should instead be pumped into education. He said it was the job of schools to ensure cohesion, arguing that trying to claim that “fraternity” could be learned in two weeks sharing a room was a “fantasy”.Gabriel Attal, a junior minister for youth and education, defended the service as a way to build cohesion and learn practical skills, from first aid and rescue skills to conservation.He described the routine in Le Parisien newspaper: “Every morning, they will wake at 7am and take part in a flag ceremony at 8am with the national anthem. Each day, there will be different modules, for example learning about defence, sustainable development or the values of the republic. They will have an hour of free time at the end of the day, when they can use their mobile phone. Their phones will be banned for the rest of the time.”He said it was about helping young people to “learn the reflexes to defend and protect themselves”, such as how to react to a terrorist attack or natural disaster. He said there would be crisis simulations such as nuclear accidents.France phased out compulsory military service between 1996 and 2001. Macron, 41, is the first French president not to have been called up to serve in the army.When he first announced the idea of introducing compulsory national service, Macron framed it as part of France’s efforts to prepare for an era of global “turbulence” comparable to the cold war.But the campaign promise was also seen as a way of playing up patriotic nostalgia for military service at a time of increasing social isions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234caad445c21daf82efebf03e67c323f3f7d740/56_334_4421_2651/master/4421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0d3c840ef99de55d783ac9fbed023ff","title":"uk france germany last ditch effort save iran deal","story":"Diplomatic offensive aims to dissuade Tehran from breaching uranium limitsBritain, France and Germany are to mount a last-ditch effort to dissuade Iran from effectively quitting the nuclear deal, warning time was running out for negotiations and the risk of war in the region “has not been averted”.The diplomatic offensive includes a forthcoming visit by the UK’s new Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison.Iran has threatened to take fresh steps to leave the deal on 27 June by breaching enriched uranium limits set out in the 2015 agreement. Officials from the three EU states, which support the deal, will also meet with China and Russia to discuss the situation.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking in Paris alongside his German counterpart, said the two countries wanted to coordinate their efforts to stop Iran’s withdrawal from the deal.“We want to unify our efforts so there is a de-escalation process that starts,” Le Drian said. “There is still time and we hope all the actors show more calm. There is still time, but only a little time.”Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign minister, added: “The risk of war in the Gulf has not been averted. We need to do everything so that it doesn’t come to this. That’s why we are talking to all sides. I was in Iran and we are also talking with the Americans. We need to de-escalate through dialogue. It is a time of ‘diplomacy first’ and that’s what we are committed to.”Murrison’s visit will be the first by a British minister since the UK claimed its own intelligence showed Iran was behind the recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf.In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani said there was no chance Iran would delay the deadline to save the deal, but is waiting on evidence that the EU can keep its side of the bargain by setting up a functioning financial vehicle through which European nations can trade with Iran and avoid US sanctions. It appears as if the EU is racing against the clock to get the proposed measure up and running.If Iran did breach the uranium limits, the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, gives both sides time to go into a disputes mechanism before it is declared void.Rouhani made it clear he was not yet willing to sit with Donald Trump and the US to renegotiate the deal. The comments came as a rocket hit a site near Basra in neighbouring Iraq used by foreign oil companies, including the US energy firm ExxonMobil. The missile strike wounded three people, and in response the oil company ordered further evacuations of staff out of the country. There have been three previous attacks on US-linked installations in recent days, but no claim of responsibility.The US evacuated hundreds of diplomatic staff from its Baghdad embassy last month, citing unspecified threats from Iran against US interests in Iraq. In Yemen, the Iranian-backed Houthis have continued their campaign to fire drones into Saudi Arabia, but an attack on Wednesday was intercepted in Yemeni air space.Analysts, as well as many Arab leaders not aligned to Saudi Arabia, believe Iran may be trying to demonstrate the chaos it can create in the oil industry if the US does not backpedal on economic sanctions. The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Meanwhile, US military officials have produced further evidence to support Washington’s claim that Iran was behind last week’s tanker attacks. The US navy displayed limpet mine fragments and a magnet it said it had removed from one of the vessels, noting the mines bore a striking resemblance to Iranian mines.Iran’s defence minister “categorically rejected” accusations that Tehran was behind the attacks, describing evidence presented by Washington as “unsubstantiated”, the country’s official news agency, IRNA, reported.Washington has released images and a grainy video it alleges shows Iranians on a patrol boat removing an unexploded limpet mine attached to one of the tankers.“The armed forces and the port organisation were among the first to approach the tankers after the incident for relief operations and they rescued 23 people in the first tanker,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b887065b4b573d109f8dadcc10561e7a4b07cb/0_620_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fc3f52ffa31c244181cbaede7bb41aa","title":"pride sale celebrates 50 years since stonewall in pictures","story":"To mark WorldPride and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, Swann Galleries in New York is holding a Pride sale, which explores and celebrates the art, influence and history of the LGBTQ+ community.

As I reached new heights, so too did my imagination. I revelled in finding a space where I could be alone, high above the world, to plot and dream and wonder.Carefully aligning my own limbs along those of the tree, I would quickly but methodically scale it, seeking out footholds, adjusting my balance as I tested each branch for whether it would bear my weight. Every tree was different, its arms spread in unique directions, inviting me to learn the climbing patterns and to inspect the knots and holes in the bark until I knew it like my own body.I wasn’t always good at climbing trees. Indeed, I remember the first time I tried I could barely make it off the ground. Our back garden in north London backed on to a small wood, with a winding brook lined by hundreds of trees. They were massive and ancient and imposing, and I was barely a sprout. The big boys could climb so much higher and faster, and this pushed me to improve, to overcome my fears and rise to the challenge. I didn’t learn so much from watching where they placed their hands and feet, but more from their spirit of fearlessness – a spirit that has remained with me to this day.And the rewards for meeting this challenge were numerous. That feeling of shinning up the tree, of upward motion. The view from the top, revealing a wider horizon. The sweet sound of birdsong, of the wind rustling through the leaves. The feeling of accomplishment, of overcoming a challenge different with every tree I climbed. Being nursed by my mother on the occasions I fell.But the ultimate payoff was making my own space. Up in the highest branches, where no one could bother me, my young mind could run wild. I dreamed of the adventures my life would bring, and invented new games to play with my friends. I contemplated the rights and wrongs of school life, the little society in which I sometimes struggled to find my place. I pictured our early ancestors, still imbued with a simian strain that allowed them to stalk soundlessly through the canopy, and what they would think of us today, in our warm houses orced from our animal instincts.To me, trees were a symbol of strength – nature at its most grand and enduring. Once my friends and I found a dead squirrel, hanging by its throat in the branches high above. It served as a powerful reminder of how deadly nature could be. We would visit daily to mourn the poor creature and to contemplate our own mortality, humbled by the majesty of the woods around us.I still climb trees. I may be older – married, with a child of my own – but the thrill remains the same. Even better, I can climb together with my daughter, who is as wobbly as I was as a boy, and help her to find the confidence to improve her balance and dexterity to get further up the tree each time. It’s a wonderfully wholesome pastime for kids, providing not only exercise but also the chance to get up close with nature and gulp some fresh air. If you have a garden, a local park or a nearby forest, go out and explore – an arboreal adventure awaits.I never did learn the names of the different trees in the woods behind my childhood home, but I never forgot how to scale them, nor the new frontiers my childhood imagination was able to forge – all alone in the treetops, safe and happy in the embrace of nature’s ancient giants."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeTory leadership vote results:  Rory Stewart drops out of the race after losing 10 votesNHS accused of \u0026#39burying\u0026#39 damning child cancer report after patients unnecessarily \u0026#39died in agony\u0026#39Comment: Why Tory MPs just sighed good riddance to rambunctious Rory StewartComment: Rory Stewart is out at last.

it’s that exact same cohort that\u0027s the most sceptical,” she said.Pockets of doubt are often fueled by anti-vax messages spreading online, particularly on social media where myths and conspiracy theories are rife. “Social media is highly volatile and it has totally changed the landscape,” said Professor Larson. “It doesn\u0027t take much to disrupt herd immunity, it really only takes a concentrated, small group of dissenters.” Across the globe, 79 per cent of people agree that vaccines are safe and 84 per cent said they thought they were effective, the report found.High income regions are more sceptical of vaccinesWhile Rwanda and Bangladesh had the most confidence in vaccines, high income countries were far more sceptical.“Vaccines are one of our most powerful public health tools,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. “We need people to have confidence in them if they are to be most effective.”In Northern Europe just 73 per cent of people agreed that vaccines were safe – though the UK, included in this group, was slightly above average at 75 per cent. But this figure drops dramatically to 50 per cent in Eastern Europe and 59 per cent in Western Europe – which includes France, the most sceptical country in the world. Some 33 per cent of French people disagreed that vaccines are safe, while 20 per cent said they were not effective and 10 per cent thought it was not important for children to receive vaccinations. Just 21 per cent of people in France had high trust in scientists, compared to 35 per cent in the UK, and it is the only country in the world where more than half of the population believe that science and technology will reduce the number of jobs available within the next five years.Professor Larson said the country has seen a “cumulative breakdown” of trust in health officials, which has contributed to outbreaks of infectious illness.Measles outbreaks are on the upMuch of this scepticism can be traced back to the 1990s, when a scandal over a blood bank tainted by HIV eroded confidence in public health. A series of coincidental links between vaccines and psychosomatic issues or multiple sclerosis followed and heightened anxieties. But the “tipping point” was in 2009, when people felt that the French government had massively overbought flu pandemic vaccines. “The public thought that the WHO highly inflated the scare, and they felt that the government was in bed with industry and creating unnecessary panic,” said Professor Larson. But she added that France has seen improvements since 2016, when the Vaccine Confidence Index found that some 40 per cent of people disagreed that vaccines were safe. Just last year, the French government followed Italy and expanded a policy which legally requires parents to vaccinate their children. Eight childhood vaccines have been added to the list of three which were already mandatory and experts say the tough stance has helped dispel doubts.“Fake news about vaccination is a global issue,” said Prof Alain Fischer, child immunology and leading vaccination expert in France. “But in France, our health authorities and government remained silent for 20 to 30 years, so anyone looking on the internet was misinformed.”“Maybe it’s counter-intuitive, especially for UK culture, but wider compulsory vaccination appears to have been received by many parents as a signal that it was important. “GPs and paediatricians tell me that it is easier for them to propose vaccinations than it was two years ago. It’s not perfect, it’s fragile but it is getting better,” he added. But experts have also cited “complacency” as part of the problem across high income countries. “In developing countries, where deadly diseases like diphtheria, measles or whooping cough are more common, I\u0027ve seen mothers queue for hours to make sure their child is vaccinated,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.“It is in wealthier countries, where we no longer see the terrible impact these preventable diseases can have, that people are more reticent. This reticence is a luxury we can ill afford,” he added. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Tory leadership vote results:  Rory Stewart drops out of the race after losing 10 votesNHS accused of \u0026#39burying\u0026#39 damning child cancer report after patients unnecessarily \u0026#39died in agony\u0026#39Comment: Why Tory MPs just sighed good riddance to rambunctious Rory StewartComment: Rory Stewart is out at last.

First-aiders had to rush at least 10 of the youngsters indoors.The incident, which took place during the inauguration of a statue of Charles de Gaulle, France’s first postwar president, is embarrassing for Mr Macron.Bringing back national service with the aim of fostering a sense of national unity and civic duty is one of his pet projects. It was a key election pledge.Emmanuel Macron reviews troops in June 2019 Mr Macron is France’s first president not to have done compulsory military service, which was abolished in 1996. The first batch of 2,000 recruits embarked on his updated version of national service at the weekend. Several hundred politicians, public personalities and military cadets also attended the unveiling of the statue on Tuesday, the anniversary of General de Gaulle’s 1940 appeal to the French to resist the Nazis.His “18 June” speech, made while he was in exile in London and broadcast to occupied France on BBC radio, is considered one of the most important in modern French history, marking the birth of the Resistance.Mr Macron’s new “Universal National Service” is mainly civic but has a military component. It was launched at the weekend with a volunteer group, but is eventually to become compulsory for all 16-year-olds.The teenagers are spending two weeks under the supervision of soldiers and youth workers, who are training them in self-defence and how to respond to a terrorist attack or natural disaster. They are only allowed to use their mobiles during a one-hour free period each day.They wear a uniform of black trousers, white shirts and a blue cap for ceremonies, and fluorescent vests for civil protection exercises.Tory leadership vote results:  Rory Stewart drops out of the race after losing 10 votesNHS accused of \u0026#39burying\u0026#39 damning child cancer report after patients unnecessarily \u0026#39died in agony\u0026#39Comment: Why Tory MPs just sighed good riddance to rambunctious Rory StewartComment: Rory Stewart is out at last.

But where and how did these animals get to North America? The teeth we studied, even though they were just two teeth, start to answer those questions.”The bones suggest that ancient hyenas entered North America via Beringia where the Bering Land Bridge formed, connecting Asia with North America during periods of low sea levels.From there, the animals made their way south to Mexico. The first hyenas known to have crossed into North America date back to around five million years ago.“These rare records of hyenas in the Arctic fill in a massive gap in a location where we expected evidence of their crossing between continents, but had no proof until now,” said Dr Tseng.Zazula  Government of Yukon)The specimens were tucked away in the collections of the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa and largely forgotten about until Dr Tseng discovered some old field notes describing the mysterious teeth. He drove to the museum and quickly identified them as belonging to the genus Chasmaporthetes.Investigating the vanishing ice in the ArcticArctic permafrost now melting at levels not expected until 2090Ancient hyenas had a erse family history, with many dozens of species found in localities ning the Northern Hemisphere.Hyenas arose in Europe or Asia around 20 million years ago.

You silly old Auntie! Despite the BBC’s unapologetically anti-Brexit bias, millions will go to the grave with a soft spot for the Beeb.But the brutal truth is that young adults born this century do not give a damn about the BBC. My -year-old daughter and her generation have no contact with the corporation.These kids think David Attenborough is that nice old man saving the planet on Netflix. They are big on BuzzFeed. They get their ­entertainment from YouTube, Netflix and Instagram.Even Facebook and Twitter seem horribly old hat to these teenagers. The BBC inspires no love at all in the millennial heart. To these st Century sprogs, born with a smart phone in their hand, the idea of paying £. a year to the BBC is absurd.Increasingly, it seems absurd to even those of us who fondly remember Bill And Ben, The ­Flowerpot Men. The licence fee is a telly poll tax from another century.The BBC only gets away with raking in a total of £billion a year in licence fees because of the generations who grew up when the BBC was the only show in town.The BBC was extremely foolish to show older ­viewers such wanton ­disrespect. Because now some painfully dficult questions are being asked of the broadcaster.Why does the BBC need to send hundreds of its staff to groove at Glastonbury every year  Does Gary ­Lineker REALLY deserve an eye-watering £,, per annum And why does ANYONE need to pay the licence fee in a world of Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Sky, BT and the infinite ersions of the internet Is there ANY place for a compulsory TV tax  Yes — the last century! The BBC has committed an epic act of self-harm. It was also a crass miscalculation by greedy BBC bosses to announce they were cancelling free TV licences for the over-s just one week after the nation honoured the generation who paid for our liberty with their youth, their blood and their lives.Victor Gregg,  years old, is a former prisoner of war who spoke for the nation. “It’s only days agowere patting all these old people on the head and calling them heroes, this generation which has saved the world,” said Victor.“These are the people now who are over . They’ve lived their le. They’re knackered.”Will the BBC prosecute ­Normandy veterans and their elderly widows for non-payment of the licence fee  Not a great look.And what a sickening prospect that any poor or vulnerable person could be prosecuted for not ­stumping up £. a year to finance the bottomless BBC trough.The BBC’s mugging of the over-s is a wake-up call for us all. This bloated, arrogant corporation has been indulged, protected and bankrolled for too long.The fat cats at the BBC need to tighten their bulging belts. Sky-high salaries need to come down. Grotesque waste — like the annual BBC beano to Glastonbury — has to be cut back.The BBC’s expansionist digital empire needs dialling down. Profligate BBC bosses must start to live within their means. £billion a year is plenty. And, yes, we need to start a national debate about the relevance of the licence fee in the modern world.And above all, the BBC needs to start showing some respect to the older citizens of this country. Because this breaking news just in.Nobody  is watching.JOKING about throwing battery acid in someone’s face is exactly like joking about rape. It will never – and can never – be funny, no matter how much you disagree with the views of the person who is being raped or disfigured by acid.Luckily for Jo Brand, she did not recommend throwing battery acid at a Labour MP or a member of an ethnic community. They would never have let her inside Broadcasting House again.But because Jo only joshed about throwing battery acid at right-wing politicians, her paydays at the BBC are safe.And although Brand was investigated by the police, I suspect the BBC now loves her even more.The comic insists she was joking and would never encourage anyone to throw battery acid at a politician for daring to have views that Jo disagrees with, likewe should possibly respect democracy and leave the EU.What a relief. And I will say this in Jo’s defence – I never saw anyone less likely to throw away a calorie-stuffed milkshake than this cruel, unfunny, virtue-signalling fatberg. Just kidding, Jo!And can we please stop referring to the children abused in Haiti as “prostitutes”  What happened with those girls in Haiti, some as young as  , was not prostitution. It was survival sex.If you are starving in a disaster zone, you do not have sex with a middle-aged charity worker for money. You do it to stay alive.AFTER Michael Gove’s cocaine confession, Boris Johnson was mocked for saying that he was not sure that he actually took the drug.But the scary truth is that nobody ever really knows what they are putting up their nose because this stuff is not regulated.It comes with no list of ingredients. There is no quality control. Cocaine is routinely cut with talcum powder, icing sugar and worse.Anyone who takes “cocaine” might believe they are on the real-deal Bolivian marching power, but you simply never know.It could easily be rat poison you are putting up your hooter. That is why I always warn my children that they should never touch cocaine with a barge pole, or indeed a rolled-up fiver.THE Cannes Film Festival was agog at the sight of ­Vietnamese model Ngoc Trinh, who rocked up to the premiere of A Hidden Le, Terrence Malick’s painfully po-faced film about a conscientious objector in World War Two, wearing a mere rumour of a little black dress.Since ing to Vietnam, Ngoc has been heavily criticised by the Vietnamese government, who have launched an enquiry into whether she violated the country’s public decency laws.“I don’t carepeople criticise it because I felt pretty in the dress, which made a good impression on the Cannes red carpet,” said Ngoc.The Vietnamese authorities should give the girl a break. She is a fine ambassador for their wonderful country. And her dress is almost certainly a lot more interesting than Malick’s sombre three-hour film.DANIEL CRAIG was trying hard to look cool and Bond-like when he hobbled through New York’s JFK airport in a foot brace and on crutches.Bond  – the working title of the next  film – has had a run of rotten luck. A director who quit. An explosion on set. Agonising over the script.  with a walking stick. By the time Craig, , recovers, his co-star Rami Malek has other filming commitments.“You can’t have a Bond film where  does not come face to face with the villain so it’s a complete nightmare logistically,” said one insider.Even this torrential rain has buggered things up for the production as Pinewood Studios, Bucks, was trying to pass itself off as sun-drenched Cuba. Bond  has been delayed more often than Brexit.JEREMY CORBYN is reportedly thinking of sacking Emily Thornberry because she keeps demanding a second EU referendum.Corbyn prefers to sit on the fence, attempting to placate both Labour’s working-class Leave voters and its middle-class Remainers.One day that fence is going to have to be surgically removed from Jeremy’s wrinkled old buttocks.

In other words . . . the car was exactly as I’d left it.“Well at least they didn’t steal anything,” I mumbled. The first he’ll know of the truth is when he reads this. Tidiness isn’t one of my strong points and nor, it seems, is PM hopeful Boris Johnson in possession of the neatness gene.The photo of his Toyota Previa’s interior makes my messy misdemeanours seem very Mini indeed. Naturally, with the age-old adage of “tidy room, tidy mind” at the forefront of their smugly neat brains, plenty will make the leap that Boris’s untidiness makes him unsuitable to lead the country.His many critics might also throw in the other car-related evidence that, when he was GQ’s motoring correspondent, he accrued enough parking tickets to paper a downstairs loo and frequently misplaced the vehicle he’d been loaned.A potential PM needs to be across the small print of every situation, they argue, and Boris is just too “chaotic” to do so. But is that true  After all, Gordon Brown and Theresa May were sticklers for detail and look what happened to them.So perhaps it’s time for a “bigger picture” personality with the strength of character to lead the country through a series of inevitably dficult decisions while leaving the crossing of Ts etc to several trusted lieutenants.According to journalist Andrew Gilligan, who worked for Boris when he was Mayor of London, his former boss has the “factory setting” of one nation Toryism and the ability to “master detail whenever he wanted to” but seldom wanted to.“A leader’s job,” Gilligan adds, “is to set the general direction and tone, choose the right people and inspire them to implement it. Lots of folk can do detail.”My friends would tell you that, despite the chaotic mess of my office at home , I possess clarity of thought when it comes to work and le’s general admin.So let’s hope that,he becomes PM, Boris is the same.

Good for them.Not all dads are as lucky and, consequently, many spent yet another Father’s Day estranged from their children through no fault of their own.My thoughts are with them.VIETNAMESE model Ngoc Trinh is in trouble with officials in her home country after wearing this barely-there frock to a film screening at the Cannes Film Festival.Nguyen Ngoc Thien, Vietnam’s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, says: “Her outfit was improper, offensive and has caused public outrage.”A matter of opinion, of course, but he’s launched an investigation that could lead to a heavy fine for Ms Trinh. Personally, I found myself more intrigued that she was attending the premiere of A Hidden Le, a thought-provoking film about a conscientious objector who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War Two.Ms Trinh isn’t in it and, as far as I can tell, wasn’t reviewing it either. Meaning, presumably, that she was simply working the red carpet to boost not only the movie but her impressive .million Instagram followers who slavishly follow her every, choreographed move.No such thing as A Hidden Le in the modern world, eh In the morning and evening rush hour, you’re luckyyou reach ten.ENGLAND women’s football manager Phil Neville and his we Julie have completed a £million makeover of their home, including a cinema with armchairs that extend to become beds.Eek.

We’re very early in the research phase.It is only used when other treatments, such as long-term antibiotics, have failed.How is it performed The treatment should only ever be performed by a qualied doctor.It involves collecting a stool sample from a donor, who is tested to ensure they carry no harmful bugs and have the correct bacteria in their digestive tracts to help combat the bug.The sample is then mixed with saline, strained and placed into the patient via a colonoscopy, endoscopy or an enema.How does it work FMT aims to replace good bacteria that has been killed or suppressed, often by the use of antibiotics.This killing of good bacteria allows bad bacteria, specically C.df, to over-populate the colon.The infection can then lead to a condition called C.df colitis, which causes painful and sometimes fatal diarrhoea.By restoring the balance of bacteria in the intestines, the idea is that the patient will be better able to fight infection.Who can be a donor Donors can be family members, or others who are known to you.But, they must:Donors are screened for a range of infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis A, B and C and syphilis.Source: Guy’s and St Thomas’ HospitalIn April, a University of Arizona study created shockwaves after researchers demonstrated long-term benefits of faecal transplants in reducing autism symptoms in children.A growing number of scientists believe gut microbiomes affect how the brain communicates with the body as well as general neurological health.The study, published in the journal Scientic Reports, found a special type of faecal transplant improved gut health and eased autism symptoms.The study said: “At two years post-treatment, most of the initial improvements in gut symptoms remained. In addition, parents reported a slow steady reduction of ASD symptoms during treatment and over the next two years.“A professional evaluator found a  per cent reduction in core ASD symptomsat two years post-treatment compared to before treatment began.”While the results are promising on the surface, Dr Paramsothy says it’s “early days” when it comes to scientically demonstrating the broader benefits of FMT.He said: “Developments like these are always promising, but what you really want to be seeing is randomised control trial data.“It’s important that we get confirmatory studies that demonstrate true benefit before we start advocating it as a main line treatment.

on April  last year.A court heard how Crossley had gone to Londons West End after having the Pet Shop Boys song West End Girls in his head and believed it contained a message for him.The hit song from the pop duo contains the lyrics: You think youre mad too unstable [...] Call the police theres a mad man around, Running down underground.Crossley told cops afterwards hed had no sleep after taking £ worth of crack the previous day.Sir Robert, who attended the sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey, was saved by teacher Riyah El Hussani who leapt from the  just one minute before a train was due to arrive.Five psychiatric reports by three doctors were filed on paranoid schizophrenic Crossley after he was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder by a jury.The second count was for trying to push a second man, Tobias French, on to the tracks at Tottenham Court Road as a train approached.Crossley boarded the train before then attacking Sir Robert at nearby Marble Arch station.The court heard how Crossley had pushed Sir Robert deliberately because he looked odd and looked unlikely to be able to withstand the attack.Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: As far as Sir Robert Malpas is concerned, apart from lacerations to his skull, he had multiple fractures to his right pelvis, and spent a week in hospital.The recovery was long and he described the effect on his le as huge, emotionally and physically.Referring to Dr Hannah John-Kamens three reports on Crossley, he said: An amount of stress has been placed on this defendant hearing a song, West End Girls, and getting on the Tube.The defendant said in evidence that before pushing... something in his head say, yes, yes, yes, I am going to harm someone one.We know that the defendant had in fact been threatened by drug dealers to whom he owed a large sum of money.It may be fair to say that in the first report a number of possible factors are mentioned, come the end shes probably putting psychosis up to the top of the list in terms of signicance where as Dr Joseph takes a dferent view.The court heard Crossley was given a -month suspended jail sentence last January for sexually assaulting a care worker in June  and racially abusing another female care worker for saying he should go to his probation service appointments.Crossley, of Leyton, East London, also received a two months suspended jail sentence for having a kne in a public place in September .Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, said: He pushed Tobias French towards the train tracks as a Central Line train was approaching.The train was about  metres away.Mr French was fortunate in that he was able to resist.Mr Crossley then caught a train to Marble Arch station where he pushed Sir Robert Malpas on to the train tracks.The court heard Sir Robert was  years old at the time and suffered severe cuts to his head, needing  stitches, as well as a fractured pelvis.Mr Aina said: While Sir Robert was in the pit below the tracks he was bravely assisted by a member of the public, Riyah El Hussani, who jumped down to the tracks.Mr El Hussani received a burn as he touched an electried track, but again, fortunately, he has recovered from his physical injury.When asked for an explanation for his action by police in his formal interview held the next day, Mr Crossley simply said, I had no sleep.During the trial, he stated in evidence, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was  year old.The defendant claimed he had not taken medication for his condition that day and had taken about £ worth of crack cocaine the day before.Continuing to describe his claims, Mr Aina said: It was a day out in West End when he was on the train  he began to hear voices and was paranoid, he said he pushed Mr French to scare him.When he got to Marble Arch he was having a panic attack.He said he was only intending to push Sir Robert Malpas to the floor.Giving evidence Dr Anneka John-Kamen said psyhcosis was a key actor in his actions when asked by Mr AIna.She said he had attributed signicant meaning to hearing the West End Girls song in the West End.He does have a history of hearing things on the radio or television which he gives signicant meaning to.She said these delusions of reference were an element of psychosis.The sentencing hearing continues."},{"url":null,"title":"office workers lunch time minutes eat

ways to meat-reduce.“Our food cupboard range now enables you to meat reduce on the go, so you can pack a whole lot more into lunchtimes.”* To celebrate the launch and to help consumers to eat healthy

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain. And on Friday she told all the other girls Tommy was giving her “fanny flutters”, who I think I once backed to win the  Guineas.Tommy’s now wearing the same haunted expression as a male praying mantis just before his head’s removed during the mating process, but by far the best thing about Maura’s arrival in the villa has been her verdict on herself. “I’m a girl’s girl.” RemarkableThe naive but still widespread belief Madonna will one day give a good interview.

Abdullah Patel held Tory leadership contenders to account over Islamophobia in a BBC debate last night - demanding they agree words have consenquences. Shortly after the debate, a Twitter account claiming to be Mr Patel branded their responses disappointing and deluded. But that account has now been deleted - and Mr Patel suspended from his job - after past anti-Semitic comments were discovered by the Twitter user. Since the row erupted, a second questioner from last nightaposs debate has ALSO been suspended from his job - in dferent circumstances.  One widely-circulated screenshot shows the account, @AbdullahPatel, saying: How long are the Zionists going to hide behind the Holocaust cry  It was a tragedy, but Gaza today is a repeat of the oppression. Mr Patel has since said he has good relationships with the Jewish community but stands any criticism of Israelaposs policy. Another comment posted from the account claimed: “Every political figure on the Zionist’s payroll is scaring the world about Corbyn. “They don’t like him. He seems best suited to tackle them!” The Mirror has been unable to independently very the tweets because the account has been deleted. The Chair of the school trust where Mr Patel is named as a deputy head announced on Wednesday that they have suspended him following media reports. Mr Yakub Patel wrote in a statement on Al-Ashraf Primary School website: Following some of the comments attributed to Mr Patel in the media this morning, the Trust has decided to suspend him from all school duties with immediate effect until a full investigation is carried out. The aposschoolapos and aposTrustapos do not share the views attributed to him. The Imam told the BBC Asian Network the school was within its right to conduct an investigation. I donapost wish to comment on their decision, he added.Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire earlier, Mr Patel said he had a very good relationship with the Jewish community. The criticism was not of the Jewish community becauseyou go through my tweets, youaposd see support for the Jewish community, he said. Theyaposre our brothers and sisters, and the Jewish community and I - especially in Gloucester - work very closely together. We actually visited a synagogue just a while ago. The BBC today insisted it vetted the members of the public asking questions during last nightaposs debate. But a spokeswoman said one inidual had reactivated an account that was dormant at the time of the vetting. And Live host Nicky Campbell said sorry to his audience for hosting the Imam again on his show today. Mr Campbell said: I would like to apologise.  Taking to Twitter, he added: We had the Imam from the BBC Tory leadership debate on our programme this morning. His social media comments have been extremely disturbing. He added: We should have checked. We didn’t. I’m sorry. The Imam probed the Tory leadership contenders about Islamophobia during the television debate. Mr Patel asked the five candidates whether they believed words had consequences and said he had seen first-hand the impact of Islamophobic rhetoric on his community. Boris Johnson said he was sorry for the offence his comments about veiled Muslim women looking like letterboxes and bank robbers had caused, while Michael Gove condemned Islamophobia as repugnant and attacked Jeremy Corbyn for comments he claimed were disgusting and anti-Semitic.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid urged all the candidates to commit to an external investigation into the issue within the Tory party, and his rivals nodded in agreement. A BBC spokeswoman said today: “We carried out background research into the online and social media profiles of all our questioners for last night’s debate. Following the debate, one inidual reactivated a public twitter account he had previously deactivated, whose tweets were not visible during our research period. Had we been aware of the views he expressed there he would not have been selected. Rob Burley, who edited the programme, said: It was AFTER the show that Mr Patel reactivated his account revealing his tweets. We wouldnapost have put him on the programmethese were public before broadcast, but they were not. We also carried out a number of other routine checks which didnapost uncover anything untoward. In a second case, another man who questioned the  on last nightaposs show has also been suspended from his job in a separate row over a historic tweet. Law firm Leigh Day took action against Aman Thakar, reportedly a former Labour staffer, after the right-wing Guido Fawkes blog unearthed a tweet in his name from February this year. It said: Hitleraposs abuse of the term nationalist is, to me a nationalist, the most harmful part of his legacy. However, the Guido Fawkes website stripped the tweet - which was part of a wider conversation - of its context. The website did not mention that the tweet came on the same day as a row over comments about Hitler and nationalism by right-wing US pundit Candace Owens. Ms Owens prompted outrage by complaining the word nationalism had been poisoned, adding: If Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine. Therefore Twitter users have suggested the tweet was a sarcastic and a p***take of Ms Owens, not a serious opinion. A Leigh Day spokeswoman said: We can confirm that Aman Thakar is currently a solicitor at Leigh Day in our employment department. We have been made aware of a tweet which we are taking very seriously. Mr Thakar has been suspended with immediate effect from the firm whilst we carry out an internal investigation into these matters.

Each of them spoke about their compassion for the poorest people, the same ones all in Cabinet repeatedly voted to make poorer. The only good news was it was so unspeakably dull, and so little was spoken apart from empty platitudes and promises, that it will have wiped even more votes off the Tories. It was a serious turn-off for anyone interested in politics, let alone those who could have been watching Emmerdale on ITV.  Boris Johnson tried to look statesmanlike, but all anyone could have thought looking at his smirking, self-satisfied face was what a state the country is inhe is the runaway favourite. All his obnoxious traits were on show – he pompously ducked the questions by drowning out Emily Maitlis and lazily forgot one questioner’s name. And he openly backtracked on his two big leadership promises, saying the October Brexit deadline is now “feasible” and his tax cuts are an “ambition”. Gormless Jeremy Hunt looked exactly as he is: Continuation Theresa May. A gormless, characterless, careerist robot offering more of the same. That startled haddock Michael Gove kept peddling a bizarre line: that he is more on the side of the working class than Jeremy Corbyn because he was, erm, adopted. Sajid Javid just seemed grateful to be there, having escaped the chop by one vote. He played the downtrodden son of an immigrant card, neatly forgetting to tell us he made a fortune in the City. At least Rory Stewart provided some entertainment by whipping his tie off after five minutes, then sliding up and down his chair for an hour like a drunk on the last bus. He also provided the only honesty on show by telling us that we’re all doomed and he, like the other four grinning stooges alongside him, haven’t got a clue what to do about it. Meanwhile, in every living room across Britain the same thought was shared – please let this excruciating show end.

These include referring to Muslim women wearing burkas as letterboxes, people from Africa as having watermelon smiles and described Scots as a verminous race. He thundered: This is a man who is not fit for office. It has been said Mr Speaker the ultimate measure of a person is not where they stand in moments of comfort but where they stand at times of challenge and controversy.  This is a time of challenge and so I ask does the Prime Minister realise he is not only is the member racist, he is stoking isions in communities and has a record of dishonesty. At that point the Speaker interrupted and warned him that he needed to be extremely careful in his language.    John Bercow told Mr Blackford to weigh his words and advised him to withdraw any allegation of racism against any particular measure. But Mr Blackford doubled down saying: But the member has called Muslim women aposletterboxesapos, described African people as having aposwatermelon smilesapos and another disgusting slur that I would never digny by repeating. He added: If thataposs not racist Mr Speaker I donapost know what is. Mr Blackford also referenced Mr Johnsonaposs record of insulting Scotland. As editor of the Spectator the Uxbridge MP published a poem describing Scottish people as “a verminous race who should be placed in ghettos and exterminated. It went on to describe Scots as “tartan dwarves” who were “polluting our stock”.    Mr Blackford told MPs: words matter and actions matter and the man who published those words in his magazine the prime minister thought was fit for the office of our top diplomat. He said that Scots should be banned from being Prime Minister and that a pound spent in Croydon was worth more than a pound spent in Strathclyde.The SNP leader asked Theresa Mayshe thinks Boris Johnson is fit for the office of Prime Minister.Theresa May hit back at Mr Blackford suggesting he did not understand how Prime Ministeraposs Questions works despite doing it for a number of years. I believe any Conservative Prime Minister in the future will be better for Scotland than the Scottish Nationalist Party. After Prime Ministeraposs Questions Tory Bill Wiggin raised a point of order about Mr Blackfordaposs question. He told Speaker John Bercow: Since you took the chair you have been a stalwart defender of backbenchers. Youaposve also stood up to bad parliamentary behaviour, like the use of the word aposracismapos. I am deeply upset that your chairmanship has been undermined dramatically because of the very calm and polite advice you gave to honourable members, leaders of political parties in this House, that was ignored. Please will you do all you can to make sure that words like aposracistapos are not common parlance in this House  The Speaker confirmed that the term racist is not of itself unparliamentary but added that it would be wise for colleagues to remember the general principle that one does not impute other members.

Unfortunately this comes too late to have saved him from the ignominy of having  to take part in last night’s unedying BBC debate . This was not the worst political programme produced by the broadcaster, that dishonour belongs to the Wembley rally during the EU referendum, but it was an appalling format which came across as a mash up between Blind Date, a local TV news bulletin and the Eurovision results. It neither allowed the participants to articulate their arguments nor for rivals to challenge them effectively . Yet again the BBC misunderstood the dference between popular and populist programming. Nor was it entirely clear how allowing five Conservatives to take regular pops at Labour without a right of reply fits with broadcasting impartiality rules.  Boris Johnson escaped without any forensic questioning of his Brexit plans.  Jeremy Hunt proved he is the Mr Cellophane of Tory politics who, the longer the race goes on, the more he displays his hidden shallows. Sajid Javid again showed he lacks any stardust, though he had one small hit by forcing the other candidates to back an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Michael Gove continued to answer every question by talking about himself with an almost pathetic neediness. Disappointingly, he was not challenged when he claimed he went into politics to help the very poorest in society. Presumably this is not the same Gove who has served in a Cabinet that has overseen a rise in child poverty, cut welfare payments and turned a blind eye to the million plus people reliant on foodbanks.Even Wonder Rory struggled.

Boris Johnson finally broke cover after being accused of ducking out of previous talks, but anyone hoping to hear how he would lead Britain was left disappointed. The former Foreign Secretary, Michael Gove , Rory Stewart , Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid clashed over tax and Brexit , even criticising their own policies, and were taken to task by a -year-old girl over their waffle and quibbling. Host Emily Maitlis struggled to make herself heard as the five tried to shout each other down during the rowdy BBC show. But when she got a word in edgeways, she did pin down Mr Johnson on whether he would call a snap election like he demanded after Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair in . But he ­chickened out of giving an answer.    Schoolgirl Erin, , from Glasgow – who took part in pupil strikes against Tory schools cuts – quizzed the candidates about climate change. But she told them: “To be honest, none of you have really impressed me in the way that I am looking for.” The five got heated over Brexit, with none able to give a cast-iron guarantee they would take the UK out of the EU on October . Mr Johnson said only that leaving on that date was “eminently feasible” and the Tory party “must” do it. During chaotic exchanges, he said: “Otherwise, I’m afraid, we face a ­catastrophic loss of confidence in ­politics. We have kicked the can down the road twice and I think the British people are getting thoroughly fed up.”    But in a direct attack on Mr Johnson, Mr Hunt told the story of a sheep farmer he met whose family business would be destroyed by no-deal. He said: “He would look at you and say, ‘Boris, you’ve got your dream, you’ve made it to Number , but you’ve destroyed my dream.’” But Mr Hunt also admitted as Health Secretary cuts to social care went too far, an admission that Tory ­policies were damaging. THIRD ROUND Boris Johnson - Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Sajid Javid -   Rory Stewart -  SECOND ROUND Boris Johnson -   Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Rory Stewart -  Sajid Javid -  Dominic Raab -  FIRST ROUND Boris Johnson -  Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Dominic Raab -  Sajid Javid -  Matt Hancock - Rory Stewart -   Andrea Leadsom - Mark Harper - Esther McVey -    Former Vote Leave chairman Mr Gove said he would be prepared to allow “extra time”a deal was close. Then he boasted: “Because I started this, I will finish it.” Mr Stewart, who removed his tie as the debate began, said it would not be possible to reach a new deal with the EU by Halloween .    Mr Johnson again shrugged off ­responsibility for his role as Foreign Secretary in the continued ­imprisonment of British mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe in Iran. Instead he blamed Tehran and ­arrogantly insisted that his words – claiming she was working as a ­journalist when arrested for spying – “didn’t make any dference”. He was challenged over his comparison of veiled Muslim women to ­“letterboxes”. Mr Javid bounced his fellow candidates into triggering an ­independent investigation into claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. The Mirror chicken was outside the BBC’s New Broadcasting House in Central London, where the debate took place, with a special message for Mr Johnson over his recent failure to attend previous debates.  High point: Played to the grassroots Tories by saying a Brexit delay would deepen the “catastrophic loss of confidence in politics”. He also claimed the October  deadline was “eminently feasible.” Low point: There were so many to choose from. First he suggested he could help out struggling nurses… by cutting the top rate of tax. Then he suggested his ill-judged comments about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe, the British mum imprisoned in Iran, “didn’t make any dference” to theof her sentence. And finally his half-hearted apology for saying women wearing face veils looked like “letterboxes.”   Jeremy Hunt  High point: When he turned to Boris Johnson, warning him that his Brexit plan would the business of a sheep farmer in his constituency. He said the farmer would tell him: “Boris, you’ve got your dream. You’ve gone to Number . But you’ve destroyed my dream.” Low point: When he was forced to deny he agreed with the “racist rants of Katie Hopkins” - but stood by his “%” support for Donald Trump’s vile attack on Sadiq Khan , saying he had been “a useless London Mayor.”   Michael Gove  High point: The Environment Secretary sounded genuinely passionate about environmental issues, promising to rid the seas of plastic waste. And he had the best put-downs for upstart Rory Stewart. When Stewart told him he was looking for the “key to the door” to getting a Brexit deal through Parliament, Gove quipped: “Weaposve run into that door three times already, Rory - weaposve got to have a dferent route out.” Low point: When he kept ignoring the question and turning his fire on Jeremy Corbyn , including branding him a “discredited Marxist” and telling him to “get in the dustbin of history”.   Sajid Javid  High point: His strongest moment was berating cabinet colleagues Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove for being open to a further Brexit delay. He told them the next PM needs to “learn from our mistakes” and keep a firm deadline, which would “ concentrate minds” in Europe. Low point: The Home Secretary looked a little deflated throughout the whole programme and failed to land any more serious blows on his rivals. This could have been a result of coming within one vote of being kicked out of the contest just two hours before the debate began.   Rory Stewart  High point: Stewart’s highlight was not what he said, but his body language. First he sat on the edge of his seat - making him look like the only grown-up whose feet reach the floor. Then, for some reason, he took his tie off - both giving the impression he was totally relaxed, and making his opponents fear he might use his spy training to strangle them. Low point: He described Donald Trump was an “extraordinary phenomenon”, and refused to commit to calling him out in public. And he did himself no favours with a huge chunk of the Tory faithful by ruling out a no-deal Brexit entirely.

They went to war in court over the future of their smallholding in Tomkyns Lane, Upminster, which the couple built up over  years of striving at dferent businesses.After the relationship broke down in , Mr Glessing, , ended up living in a converted pigsty on their land, Central London County Court heard.   He claimed he hit rock bottom after his ex bundled his clothes outside the back door of their home and gave him his marching orders in . However, she flatly denied excluding him from the family house, insisting that he still holds a key and chose to move into the sty of his own accord. Now a judge has turned down Mr Glessingaposs attempt to claim cash from his ex for the time he spent living in the pigsty, along with his bid to carve off a slice of their land for himself. The court heard that Mr Glessing and Ms Lazell had already been together for  years when they built a home  years ago on their three-acre plot in Essex which is now worth £m. They raised two children at the smallholding, which comprises a house, outbuildings and a farmyard which Mr Glessing said is one of the prettiest places in England.    They sold free range eggs from their land, raised pigs and had an e-cigarette business, before Mr Glessing moved onto selling noodles and cleaning products. But Ms Lazell told the court that she and her ex split after Mr Glessing suggested she had slept with another man around  years ago. “He got that in his head,” she said, and added: “he had never articulated it before”. “My reaction was total shock,” Ms Lazell told the court, and she insisted on taking a polygraph test to prove his suspicions . She passed the lie detector test and showed the results to Mr Glessing, she explained, but he was still unconvinced, the court heard. “He just said they’re not always correct,” added Ms Lazell.  The former couple ended up in court after their breakup when Ms Lazell said she wanted their property sold and the proceeds split down the middle. Mr Glessing was unwilling to give up the farmyard, to which he is “deeply emotionally attached”. It’s got trees around it and you can’t see it from the lane. Some of the oak trees there are  years old, he told Judge Richard Roberts. I don’t even like calling it a yard, it’s a lovely place. He asked the judge to grant him the right to carve off the farmyard and buy it for himself before the rest of the property is sold. And he also brought a claim for occupational rent against his ex in relation to the time he says he was “excluded” from the family home by her. But Ms Lazell denied kicking him out and insisted he moved into the pigsty of his own free will. “He was never kicked out of the house, he chose to go. He was not kicked out of the family home and he still has a key,” said Ms Lazell. She said her ex initially moved into a portacabin complete with shower, which was “quite cosy for one person”. “Mr Glessing came out of the cabin and chose to move into this pigsty,” she added. “He came out of the cabin to rent it to a friend. When his friend left, he went back into the cabin, it was his choice to move into this shed.”    He often ed to chat to his son or to walk his dog, she told the court, and even took a comfy bed from the spare room to make his outside quarters more welcoming. Judge Roberts rejected Mr Glessingaposs claim for rent from his ex as compensation for his being excluded from the house, saying there was no evidence he had been turfed out. “It doesnapost seem fair or equitable to charge her occupational rent, he said. He also ruled against Mr Glessing on his bid to keep the farmyard, plus another small slice of land. Judge Roberts also rejected Ms Lazell’s own bid to claim £, from Mr Glessing for occupational rent over his continued use of the farmyard. The judge ordered that the entire site and house should be sold within six months and the profits split equally between the former couple. Ms Lazell is currently still living in the family home, the court heard, while Mr Glessing is in a cabin next to the house but plans to move where once the property is sold. Losing the yard will be “a great upset” for Mr Glessing, explained his barrister, George Woodhead, who said his client had done his best to settle the case before trial.

The totaposs mum and dad Shaun Reavley, , took her to the Urgent Care Centre in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, where doctors sent Emily home with antibiotic cream and medicine to treat chickenpox. But within a few hours of being home, Emilyaposs temperature had aposskyrocketedapos so her parents rushed her to Watford General Hospital where she was diagnosed with the most severe case of HFMD aposdoctors had ever seenapos. Emily had to be quarantined in her home for the next  days as the disease is highly contagious - and spent the first five days slumped on the sofa in tears from the pain. While her little girl is now back to her usual aposhappyapos self, mum Emma is sharing the shocking images of Emilyaposs blistered face and body to warn parents of how dangerous HFMD can get. Emma, of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said: Emily started getting a few spots on her neck and I thought it was chickenpox. Evie had chickenpox just three weeks earlier.    It was just a few at first but it was like they were literally appearing before my eyes. As the day went on, the worse they were getting. Her whole body was covered and she had them in her mouth and down her throat. At the hospital, the doctors said it was the worst case of HFMD theyaposd ever seen. We had to keep her incubated indoors at home for two weeks. Fourteen days is such a long time to keep a child quarantined. She was watching everyone go out and play and she couldnapost go out. It was really upsetting for her. It was horrible. Normally even when Emily is poorly, sheaposs like a tornado running around. Sheaposs full of beans. Sheaposs always on the go as soon as sheaposs up in the morning. Sheaposs a livewire. It was horrible. It really was heartbreaking to see her like that. I donapost ever want to experience it again. It wasnapost until five days into her quarantine that she started to get back to herself and being a bit cheeky. Looking at her now, sheaposs a completely dferent child to the one in those pictures when she was poorly. I never knew HFMD could be so extreme. More people need to be aware. Itaposs not just a case of a few spots on their hands, feet and mouth. Emily was particularly unlucky but it can spread and be so serious.    The worried parents first tried to take Emily to their GP but as he was on holiday, were advised to visit a pharmacy where the pharmacist told them to go to the Urgent Care Centre. At urgent care, Emily was put in isolation for five hours while doctors ruled out measles and scarlet fever as they were uncertain what was causing the totaposs symptoms. When tests for measles and scarlet fever came back negative, Emma says the doctors decided to treat Emily for chickenpox but advised she be taken to hospitalshe aposwent downhillapos. Emma said: As Emilyaposs spots spread, I was looking at them and thinking apostheyaposre not chicken poxapos. Having so many children, I know what they look like. I decided to keep an eye on them but the next morning she was so bad I knew something wasnapost right. As our doctor wasnapost in, we were told to go to the chemist and the pharmacist said Emily needed to be looked at by a doctor as soon as possible so we took her to urgent care. I left her in the car with my husband at first in case she was contagious and went in to explain that we thought she had chickenpox but werenapost sure. They sent her to isolation where she spent the next five hours with doctors coming in and out doing tests because they didnapost know what was wrong.    They ruled out scarlet fever and measles, thank goodness, and decided to treat it like chickenpox. They sent Emily home with antibiotic cream and medicine but told us to take her to hospitalshe went downhill or her temperature spiked - which it did within a few hours of getting home. Once home, Emilyaposs condition deteriorated rapidly with her temperature rising to C so Emma and roadside mechanic Shaun rushed their youngest daughter to hospital. Doctors at the hospital immediately recognised Emilyaposs symptoms as a severe case of HFMD as she was the third case they had seen that day. The toddler had to spend a few hours in hospital while doctors monitored her heart rate which had shot up but was eventually allowed home. Emma was given a throat spray to help ease the pain of the ulcers in Emilyaposs throat and told to give her daughter allergy relief tablets and apply E cream to her sore skin. While Emily was back to herself after five days, the blisters took six weeks to clear completely and she still has some minor scarring from them. Once the little girlaposs two-week quarantine was over, Emma admits they got some concerned looks from strangers when out and about as Emily was still covered in red blotches. Although it wasnapost easy keeping Emily cooped up for  days, Emma urges parents whose kids have HFMD to do the same as the condition is incredibly contagious and airborne. When she came with me to the shops, once she was allowed out again, we did get people staring. People look asto say aposoh my god whataposs that child got apos. I would do exactly the same because Iaposd be worried they were contagious but we would never have risked taking Emily out while she was still contagious. It was hard for her being inside for so long. She loves coming with me on the school run and to the shops but it was necessary. I would tell any parent whose child has HFMD to follow doctors orders and keep them quarantined for two weeks because it is so contagious and itaposs airborne. If you just take them to the park or for a walk around the block, they can pass it to another child without even touching them. Thataposs so unfair on that child and their parents who then need to experience it. It really has been horrible. Consultant paediatrician Dr Ramesh Chaniyil from West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust, who manage the Urgent Care Centre in Hemel Hempstead, said: Weaposre delighted to hear that Emily has made a full recovery. It can be very easy to miss Hand, Foot and Mouth disease in its early stages as the blisters can look similar to the blisters which appear with chicken pox.

She claims the food had been eaten and could no longer be seen. It was absolutely ridiculous, Mrs Fricker said. It was the end corner of the sausage roll. I just dropped it for the pigeons that were there, and he came out of nowhere, stuck a badge in my face and started reading me my rights. He was telling me he was recording me, and asking for my name and address - asking for proof of who I was. I asked him what he was doing with my information and he wouldn’t answer.    I wasn’t given a chance to speak. He didn’t explain why he was in my face until he had my name and address. Mrs Fricker said the food had already been eaten by the birds. The crumbs were already gone before he actually stopped me, she claimed. He said it was a substantial amount of food. It wasn’t. It was the corner of the pastry - the little tiny bit at the bottom. I told him I was feeding the pigeons and he said he couldnapost see any pigeons.

His parents Gareth and Yasmin Ruddock, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, used to take him anywhere and everywhere and he loved swimming.But last year the youngster was given a shock diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia , a type of cancer affecting the white blood cells which help the body fight off infections.The familyaposs lives have been turned upside down and now, worried about the risk of infections, their efforts are put into keeping Jack away from other people. His heartbroken parents say he is unable to enjoy the type of le you would typically expect for a young boy - going to playgrounds and swimming with friends. And when he asks questions, they explain it is because of his poorly blood.  Gareth and Yasminaposs ability to take their son out and do normal things has been compromised.Instead, Jack is back and forth from hospital and has to have gruelling chemotherapy treatment for the next two years.His dad says Jack even recognises the maroon colour worn by hematologists - blood specialists - and howls when they come into the room. Gareth, , a driving examiner, told : Most of our effort is making sure Jack is away from people. His cancer affects his ability to grow healthy cells. If he goes into a state called aposneutropenicapos we shut down everything and keep him away from everyone. Neutropenia is when a person has a low level of neutrophils - a type of white blood cell which helps the body fight infection by destroying harmful bacteria and fungi that invade the body.    When neutropenic, we keep Jack away from crowds and are extremely wary around anyone who is sick, Gareth says. This means he is unable to enjoy the type of le you would typically expect for a young boy. Most kids would go to a play frame. Thataposs not an option for us anymore. Most kids would go swimming but Jack canapost go anywhere near a swimming pool. We go to country parks where itaposs more likely we can be away from other people. It limits our ability to take him out and do normal things.  Jack, who has a one-year-old brother called Charlie, used to be taken everywhere and anywhere and swimming was a big part of his le until he got ill. Weaposd got him to a point where he was really good at swimming and had to stop, his father said. He is very good though and accepts whataposs put in front of him. We have come up with a system of telling him aposweaposre really sorry mate, itaposs not you itaposs your poorly bloodapos. He takes everything in his stride. Jackaposs cancer was discovered after he was in hospital for a severe case of chicken pox in April . Gareth said: He was lying there not moving, he didnapost want to eat. We knew something was up straight away because he likes his food. He was just not with it, not himself, not responsive. Yasmin, , added: I just thought he had a bit of an infection with his chicken pox. The parents took Jack to West Suffolk Hospital where he was placed in isolation. He had blood tests and his parents said doctors spent three days trying to find out what  was wrong with their son. They couldnapost get his temperature to below C and he was saying gobbledygook, Gareth recalled. Then on May  last year, the parents remember being pulled into a side room and told the devastating news that their son had leukemia. Yasmin walked out crying and I only stayed a minute longer, Gareth told. We asked aposwhat do we do apos That was one of the worst days of my le. The parents said they remember that night as terrible.  Jack was sent in an ambulance to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge where they were told what to expect and what the treatment would be. Six to eight months of hell awaited the family, during which they were warned they would have to be back and forth from hospital. He was dehydrated, not eating. He had a hell of a time, Gareth said. It got to the point where he recognised the maroon colour the hematologists wore and was scared. When they came in the room, I remember the howls. That was the worst part. When Jack started chemotherapy, he was having daily treatment which his parents said was aposhellapos. Now he is on daily oral chemotherapy at home, and once a month he goes to hospital for the treatment. He also has to have steroids and every three months he has a lumbar puncture. This is a test that can be used to check for lymphoma cells in the  cerebrospinal fluid, which protects and cushions the brain and spinal cord.  One of the side effects of his chemotherapy is that Jackaposs joints are weakened, and the parents take a bottle of Calpol wherever they go just incase. Yasmin organises everything they need each day and Gareth says she stays aposstrong for the boysapos and is aposthe best woman I knowapos. He says he couldnapost do it without her. Meanwhile, Jack has to have physiotherapy and is tired constantly from his treatment - which he will continue to have until July . The parents know thatJack does get an infection, he will need to be admitted to hospital straight away.   He has regular blood tests which pick up neutropenia and nurses give the family home visits on a weekly basis.  If Jack is neutropenic and asks to go somewhere where there could be crowds, his parents have to apologise and the youngster bravely accepts what his mum and dad tell him.  The parents say they hold it together in front of the kids, but when they go to bed the tears are released. And itaposs a juggling act between meeting the needs of both their boys, Yasmin admits. Our whole lives are around what Jack can and canapost do and what we can do to make sure he has as normal le as possible, the parents say. Each day is dferent, we take it as it comes.Gareth says he wanted to do something hard to reflect on the challenging le Jack leads. So on June , he and three friends will climb up the Pyg Track to the summit of Snowdon. My reason for this is attempting to simulate as closely as I can to the type of pain and resilience that Jack has to show every day, the proud dad said. He added: Both myself and my we are extremely grateful to everyone who we have had contact with – at West Suffolk Hospital, Addenbrookes, district nurses, our GPs and everyone at Clic Sargent who have had an immeasurable positive impact on our lives and helped us understand, cope and move forward.

But the -year-old endured a decade of agonising migraines, which left her temporarily blind and unable to speak all because of her favourite tipple. But now Alex says sheaposs finally discovered the root of her problem — a single ingredient in her favourite tipple.Alex started experiencing powerful cluster headaches eight years ago.The retail manager was forced to take time off work and even the strongest painkillers had no effect.    Medics were dumbfounded by Alex’s symptoms and even wanted to put her on antidepressants while changing her contraception pill. But now Alex, from Leeds, says a blood test has uncovered the true cause — she’s intolerant to chardonnay grapes, the fruit used in her favourite wine. And after swapping chardonnay for a dferent white wine, the symptoms have completely disappeared. Now Alex is urging other sufferers to look more closely at their diet. She said: “I just didnapost understand what was going on.    “And at no point did I suspect wine was the cause of my awful migraines because I was never drinking to excess. “Iaposd go out for a drink, have a couple of glasses of wine with friends and be fine the next day. “But then at other times I would have a single small glass of wine and I’d be unable to open my eyes the next morning. “The pain was often so severe I’d be unable to see clearly or speak coherently. But I never put two and two together that chardonnay grapes were the issue.” University of Wales graduate Alex took codeine or co-codamol to deal with the pain - but nothing worked. She added: “It was bad...really, really bad.   Sometimes I’d be struck down first thing in the morning, other times I’d wake during the night having a migraine and just couldn’t get back to sleep.“It was so debilitating. And my husband John and I were obviously getting worried something more serious was at play, like anyone would be.” Alex went to see her GP, and initially thought the migraines could be a byproduct of stress and fatigue. She adds: “Initially, I put it down to being tired. And my GP urged me to change my contraceptive pill, thinking that it might be exacerbating my symptoms. “But Iaposd been on the Pill for years, so that didn’t make sense.  “My GP also offered me anti-depressants, but I was like, ‘I’m not depressed!’” Earlier this year Alex, who was having at least one attack every month, began to explore some of the most common causes of recurrent migraines - and learned how food intolerances was one. She ended up having a finger prick blood analysis by UK firm YorkTest Laboratories. And there in the results, writ large and clear, was the chardonnay grape as her most troublesome ‘trigger’ food. She adds: Iaposd never been fussed about the type of wine I had.  “If a waiter asked what I wanted, it was often just a choice between red or white. “And you think of chardonnay and assume it’s a lovely light wine. For me, though, it was obviously something I should have been avoiding like the plague.” Alex says she immediately cut chardonnay from her diet - and she’s not had a single migraine since. She explains: “I’ve not had a headache. Nothing. It’s been a revelation. “The test also revealed I have a mild intolerance to yeast, so I’ll have a ginI go out - which contains much less yeast than other alcoholic drinks - and I’ll feel absolutely fine. “It’s definitely something other migraine sufferers need to be aware of.”  Food intolerance testing is growing in popularity in the UK.Symptoms of a food intolerance can be wide ranging, but may include digestive issues, stomach pain, excess flatulence, tiredness, itchy skin, acne, eczema , joint pain and headaches.And the most effective test measures what’s known as ‘IgG reactions’. Dr Gill Hart, a biochemist with YorkTest Laboratories, explains: “When food particles enter the bloodstream, the immune system can sometimes identy these food protein particles as “foreign” and produces what’s known as ‘IgG antibodies’ to ‘attack’ the food in question. “This response is your immune system’s natural defence mechanism to ward off harmful invaders in the body which can create inflammation. “So, essentially, these IgG reactions go hand in hand with gut imbalances and inflammation and are released in the presence of certain ‘trigger’ foods. “And by monitoring which foods cause food-specic IgG reactions, we can advise people on what they might wish to cut from their diet.” YorkTest Laboratories added: Most of us put symptoms after drinking down to a hangover, but often this doesn’t always reflect a true picture as intolerance to ingredients in drinks such as wine can cause similar, but often longer term symptoms.

Angela Ellis-Jones ed to her house in Sutton, Surrey following three weeks with her mother in Wales to discover an ugly metal postbox attached to the front door. It was clear that somebody had been trying to steal her post. What wasnapost as immediately obvious was the s someone had gone to to steal Ms Ellis-Jones identity and with it, her house. The incident remained in the back of my mind, but it was not until I received a letter from the Land Registry two months later that I discovered the real reason my post had been targeted, she explained.    The letter was entitled ‘Completion of Registration’ and went on to state that the property now belonged to a total stranger. Someone had stolen my home! After the reality sank in, I felt frightened and feared for my safety. With a house worth this much, what s would they go to get me out of the way  When she contacted the Land Registry Ms Ellis-Jones was told a solicitor in Tooting, London had confirmed the identity of a woman who had wanted to transfer the propertyaposs ownership. On October  a notice of the application was sent to the homeowner, who was given just  days to respond to it. With Ms Ellis-Jones away from home for so long and with her letterbox high-jacked, she never received the letter. On November  her property was officially transferred to someone . She continued: The first I knew that my property had been stolen was when I received the completion of registration notice later in November — once again, not sent by tracked post. The fraudster had also paid the £ transfer fee by postal order, which does not require you to have a bank account, securing their anonymity. What followed was a battle to get my home back, and at times it felt like the law was on the criminal’s side. The Land Registry viewed the issue as a ‘civil matter’ rather than fraud. Because the home now technically belonged to another woman, the Land Registry had to track her down to ask whether she objected to Ms Ellis-Joneaposs name being put back on the register. This took a further three weeks. She added: I was told that, had the fraudster lodged an objection, the ‘parties’ would have to negotiate as to who rightfully owned my house, which could take months. If we reached deadlock, the case could go to the Lands Tribunal, dragging out the process even longer. Thankfully, matters never got that far. The fraudster must have realised the game was up, as she offered no objection to me reclaiming my house. And on February  this year, I was told it was mine once again. Although things worked out for the best in the end,she had spent more time at her motheraposs the situation could have been far worse. I might have been days away from having my house snatched and let or sold without there being anything I could do about it, she said. After all the time spent on this, and the distress, I believe I deserve compensation. Yet the Land Registry has neither apologised nor admitted it let a fraudster slip through the net. I was the victim of a very serious fraud. A spokesman for the government body told the Mirror online: HM Land Registry is doing all it can to minimise the risk of property fraud and to maintain the integrity of the Land Register.

Sara Eisenman, from Sedona, Arizona, USA, was mortied when she looked in the mirror in her early s and saw her hair had started to turn grey very rapidly. After seeing the greys as a negative sign of ageing, she immediately started to hide her silver locks with box dyes every two weeks, afraid of anyone seeing her new natural colour. She even prioritised dying her hair just hours before giving birth to her son, Abe, , so that when people visited them, they wouldnapost see any tell-tale signs of getting older.  But  years on and now a mum of two, Sara started to change her mindset towards her box dyes and image, realising there were more important things in le than whether she had freshly dyed hair or not. At , after -years of colouring her hair at home, Sara ditched the dye and started to view her silver hair as a aposcrownapos and found that she felt completely liberated and reborn. Saraaposs husband, Hanan, , supported her decision but when she confided in her friends, she was told that she would look aged and like a witch.Sara will turn  in September and instead of feeling as though she is in decline as she gets older, she has more energy than ever before, looks and feels the best she has done in her le and she says itaposs all thanks to embracing her natural silver hair.  My hair turned almost entirely silver, literally overnight, at the age of . I went to the mirror one day to find that silver hair was emerging from the roots all over my head, said Sara. It was seen by me as a startling marker of ageing at a time when I was supposed to be in the height of youth. To disguise this evidence I took to colouring my hair very aggressively every two weeks, with a slew of other products - powders, hair crayons, etc, to disguise the roots in between dying. I could not afford to go to a salon so I would use cheap box dye and undertook this messy process at home as frequently as possible to hide what was happening to me, of which my hair was a glaring symbol. My shame was to the point that I would avoid people for fear of my roots showing. I even had my hair coloured hours before I knew Iaposd be going into labour with my son, so that everyone who came to see the new baby would also see a new mama with freshly dyed black hair and no tell-tale roots.  My le changed with my two small children who needed me constantly in the early years, as all kids need their parents, and it made colouring my hair seem so much less important. I suddenly began to aposforget myselfapos - in this case in the best way possible - and turn all my attention towards a much bigger picture than my grey roots. At , after more than  years of colouring every two weeks, I could no longer remain a slave to the box of dye - other considerations were simply too important. When I confided my decision to friends, I was told how much it would age me, and that I would look like a aposwitchapos. Yet I knew very steadfastly in my heart that these stereotypes would prove completely incorrect, and I never touched a bottle of dye again. I feel like my hair is a symbol of natural beauty and freedom, and Iaposm extremely grateful to play any role I can in helping women discover how amazing they truly are, how free and fun le can be, and how we can find sisterhood and community in it all.  As I approach  and am at the point in le where Iaposm supposed to be aposdecliningapos due to middle age, I find myself looking, feeling, and being better than ever. I am living my dreams. I have published three books - including one called Splendor: The Nazarite Method to growing Long, Strong, Healthy, Holy Hair, all about my journey with silver hair and hair growth - and am writing more. In embracing my silver hair, I feel more alive, more beautul and sexier than ever in my mid-s. My embodied philosophy is that, through every single stage of le, we donapost necessarily aposageapos so much as we have the opportunity to continuously grow. Embracing this is what it means to be truly ageless.

That said, you wouldnapost expect to spend a fortune on the whole thing unless you were the bride or groom.But one woman has revealed that a friend getting married expected her closest pals to shell out more than £, to be a part of her wedding.  Writing on Redditaposs Bridezillas forum, the unnamed woman explained that the bride-to-be demanded her Maid of Honour and bridesmaids fork out for certain things as sheaposd bestowed upon them the honour of being in her wedding party.This included them spending £ on bridesmaid dresses each, £ on hair and make-up each and roughly £ per person for the hen do. And when questioned about these expenses, the bride is said to have shrugged them off because it was HER DAY.    Unsure of where to begin with the story, the woman takes readers back to the engagement party, where the lucky members of the wedding party were first selected. She wrote: First of all, she had an engagement party to kick off what is to be  months of constant celebrations leading up to the big day. This party was complete with personalised wine bottles for each of her selected bridesmaids and MOH.[The bridal party] were required to go dress shopping with her, then shoe shopping, then accessories shopping. Once she was able to find the perfect ensemble for her day, they were required to go shopping for their dresses and shoes and accessories. They were also required to have professional hair and make-up done.   After paying hundreds of pounds for their outfits, then came the over-the-top bachelorette party, which lasted a week and involved renting limos. She planned a week-long event that consisted of renting a luxurious house in Napa Valley, complete with limo rentals to go wine tasting for three days, the woman continues. However at this point, the brideaposs long-term BFF decided enough was enough and complained about how much they had spent on her wedding. Bridezilla tells her point-blank, aposThis is MY DAY and Iaposm the ONLY one that matters.apos Fast-forward a few hours and Bridezilla kicks her out of the weddingand says she never wants to see her again. Another bridesmaid decided sheaposd had enough too and bailed out on the Napa trip. WOW.    The rest of the wedding party continued to put up with the Bridezilla and saw it through to the big day - where instead of giving gts, they were asked to donate yet more money towards the coupleaposs honeymoon fund. At the end of the post, the woman broke down all of the costs the bridesmaids incurred, and the numbers will shock you: Attendant dresses , shoes , accessories , professional hair and makeup , Napa Valley house rental, airfare round-trip , food drinks for the week , limo rentals to go wine tasting and one le-long friendship. Many people were shocked by the costs of these things. One person said: Jesus for my sisters wedding we each paid  for Our dresses - we all did our own hair makeup nails. I don’t get why people feel the need to splurge so much for a one day ordeal.A second commented: How selfish do you have to be to demand so much time and money from the people you love,  especially  when you alone are dictating the cost ! !A third added: What a spoiled, entitled little f***ing brat.

Every now and then youaposll stumble across a post that will either leave you scratching your head in bewilderment or it will make you so mad youaposre simply lost for words. One recent tweet from an American writer seems to have accomplished both of these things. Journalist Denise McAllister, from North Carolina, shared a post on Twitter in which she slammed other women for playing the aposvictimapos after seducing men.    The bizarre tweet reads: I am sick and tired of hearing women act like victims when they’re the ones who seduce men with their glossy lips and lubed legs, choosing to have sex because they’re too horny to stop, then complain when they get pregnant acting asit’s all the man’s fault.

She added: As for the substance of my tweet, I’m not talking about rape. I’m talking about women taking responsibility for what they freely do with their bodies. They need to stop blaming men for everything. Autonomy is wonderful. Women should have it. But with autonomy comes personal responsibility. If you want to make yourself sexy to attract some of that apostoxic masculinityapos you obviously hunger for and then spread your legs for a good time, own it.

Travers Beynon, AKA The Candyman, is famed for his polyamorous le. As well as his stunning we Taesha, with who he has two children, Travers also has a string of model girlfriends. These even share his bed with his we. The couple have two daughters, Velicia, six, and Serafina, five, and Travers has two children from a previous marriage to Venezuelan beauty queen Ninibeth Leal - Valentino, , and Luciana, . Taesha, a former body building champion, said that she actually instigated their infamous polyamorous lestyle, not Travers.    And now the controversial businessman looks set to lt the lid on his unusual le with a fly-on-the-wall reality TV show. Behind the scene shots which appear to show filming at his sex mansion have been leaked. The show is rumoured to be based around Beynonaposs eyebrow-raising family dynamic and will focus not only on his we but also his girlfriends. His model daughter, Lucciana and his DJ son, Valentino, are also expected to feature. The leaked images show UK based production company ‘Gass Productions’ at The Candy Shop Mansion late last year.  Party goers from the  ‘Secret Society’ party seemed to have witnessed a full camera crew at the lavish event. Pictures show that film equipment was dominant throughout the  hour party. A spokesperson for Travers Beynon said: “There has been great UK interest in Travers and his family however at this stage we can neither confirm or deny that there will be a reality show based around the Beynon family coming to the UK.” Last year Travers Beynon hosted a ‘Secret Society’ themed party in his luxurious mansion. It was dubbed it ‘The World’s Biggest House Party’.  The businessman said: Itaposs only taken  years to create the best party on the planet. When you think of the Candmay party, you think next level - then double it. A Candyman party is a place to be free and live out your wildest fantasies without any judgement. The only problem with my party is that my bed only sleeps nine girls. Last December more than , people flocked to the bash. Dom Perignon flowed, along with Moet, Gentleman Jack and Grey Goose vodka. And the centre piece of the party - Travers himself. He arrived on a floating stage on the river behind his -bedroom aposorgyapos mansion.  People clamour to get on the guest list but there is only space for , people - and The Candyman has come up with a very unusual way of deciding who will be getting in. He has teamed up with Celebrity Ink to brand fans around the world with a real tattoo of his Candy Shop Mansion logo. Travers claims , people from countries including  Australia, Indonesia, India and Thailand have confirmed they will be getting the tattoos. Taesha speaking previously to : When I was younger I was into girls. I was curious and I kissed girls but it never went further than that. Our first few years of married le were normal. We had children, we got married, but I would text him pictures of girls and ask himhe liked them or point out girls when we were out. One night, the couple decided to invite another girl into their company and their bed has rarely been empty since.  Four women - and just one man - sleep there on an average night while at parties, naked bodies tend to spill out onto the floor, the couple said. I like girls the way Travers does so it works for us both, Taesha said. The couple met when Taesha was just  but their  year age gap has not proved a barrier to their enduring love, they said. An agent first invited Taesha to one of Traversapos Candyman parties but she turned down the offer. When she was later recruited to work at a Candyman party, she refused two roles - as a rollerskater and a cloakroom attendant - but she eventually agreed to be a hostess.  And when she met Travers there she said it was love at first sight. I had Googled him before and I thought he was really hot but when I met him I froze. He was the most drop-dead gorgeous thing I had ever seen. He had glasses on and when he took them off he had the most amazing green eyes. It was instantly love for me. But he takes his parties very seriously. He just said hello and was very business like. He was not sleazy at all and clearly respected all the girls which impressed me. We didnapost get together that night but we were destined to be together because we kept crossing paths.  We always saw each other on a track we both exercised on. I was with my mum the first time we met there and I was too shy to speak. But then we bumped into each other at a club. He told me I had a really fat ass and gestured at it. I couldnapost really hear him so I went right over to him and he told me I had a really big ass again. He offered to help me with my modelling portfolio and we just really clicked. The couple quickly had daughter, Velicia, now six, and found their dream house - the Candyman Mansion - where they now live and throw their elaborate parties.  Taesha said: We had desperately wanted the house and when we were moving in we went for a celebratory dinner in a restaurant we had wanted to go to for a while. He started telling me aposI love you. Youaposre the mother of my children,apos and all these sweet things. Then he took out a ring, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him in front of the whole restaurant. I said aposyes Iaposll marry youapos. He had already asked my dad. Heaposs very romantic when he wants to be.  You would not know it from  Instagram  but he has a sweet side. The Candyman is just a persona. Our initials were the same even before we married. We were just meant to be together, she said. Now they have a custom made bed, the size of three king sizes put together, that stands under a mirrored ceiling spiked by a stripper pole. Expertly lit make-up stations, walk-in wardrobes and bathrooms line the walls. The Candyman marketing strategy has outraged many, who claim the images objecty and degrade women, but the couple insist that Travers is actually a progressive thinker, and a feminist, behind all the sleazy marketing gloss.

The girlaposs mother and her we appealed that decision and won, arguing the man was not the legal father, citing a New South Wales law setting out rules for fertilisation procedures, which specically addressed the situation of same-sex couples.    The appeal to the High Court set up a conflict between the Commonwealth Family Law Act and NSW state law, which was the basis of the mothersapos win. Robert relied on the Commonwealth law to stake his claim as a parent, while Susan and Margaret relied on the   NSW Status of Children Act and its stipulations that a sperm donor is not a father. The Commonwealth Government intervened to support Robertaposs case, while the Victorian Attorney-General backed up the case of the two women. Today the High Court ruled in Robertaposs favour. The court found the NSW law was not applicable, and that the definition of parent under Commonwealth law should be applied. The courtaposs majority judgement said the term apossperm donorapos suggests that the man in question has relevantly done no more than provide his semen to facilitate an articial conception procedure on the basis of an … understanding that he is thereafter to have nothing to do with any child born.

I think he got in the Championship Team of the Year when they won the league in  so he’s a top player.“He was good defensively for us and got up and down all day long.“That’s what you’re looking for from a full-back nowadays.”Losing Smith and McDaid, along with last season’s Championship top scorer Lawrence Shankland, goalkeeper Ross Doohan and defender Michael Rose was a blow for the Honest Men.However, Paisley-born Docherty insists with most of their squad from last season signed up, they can make a push for promotion once again.Experienced heads like former Terror Mark Kerr, Steven Bell, Michael Moffat, Andy Geggan, ex-Dundee man Jamie Adams and Craig Moore have agreed new deals since the end of the last campaign and Docherty has warned they should not be counted out of competing at the top of the table again.He added: “The team did so well and maybe over-achieving has cost us a little.“With that you are going to lose a couple of players.“The big-hitters are away but we have a lot of players signed up who know the club and what it’s all about.”A four-season veteran at Somerset Park, Docherty has made  appearances for Ayr.However, in recent times, he has been dogged by injury and has only had  run outs in each of the past two seasons.He believes he has put those fitness woes behind him and aims to get himself back in the engine-room of a successful team.Docherty added: “Last season I was coming back from injury and once the season started it was hard to get in.“We were doing so well and I was happy to play a role but it was a bit frustrating.“Hopefully, I can be a lot more involved in a good season this time out.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43621051-240x180.jpg

accepted, though, he would have offers to stay full-time and he may now get that chance with Dundee.He could be handed training facilities next week andhe proves his fitness that could lead to a

Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article16536632.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/4_shr_ayp_260216nick.jpg","title":"bulldozers flatten buildings ayrshire main 16536673#comments","story":"NewsBulldozers about to flatten buildings in Ayrshire Main StreetShareBySarah Hilley:,  JUN NewsPrestwick Main Street, general view \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn old police station and social work office are set to be demolished next month.

Consultation would take place with residents once plans are developed. The council bought the old station from Police Scotland to make room for the affordable development. Officials said failure to deliver the housing may lead to the council losing a subsidy and not being able to increase numbers of affordable homes.Prestwick residents have voiced concern about whether the new housing would be in the right place. A petition was also organised to save the old jail and social work office, which are hailed as part of Prestwick’s character.A call was made for the buildings to be used for other purposes instead of being knocked down. Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterPrivacy noticeTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterPrivacy noticeEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPolice ScotlandPrestwick"},{"url":null,"title":"call-to-get-more-cars-back-into-galas-centre-to-save-the-high-street","story":"A CALL has been made to create more parking in the centre of Galashiels in an effort to save the high street.It comes after an application was submitted earlier this year to allow the sale of food goods at units currently occupied by Carpetright and Currys at Comley Bank Mill Retail Park.Developers said there had been interest from supermarket giant Lidl over moving to the area.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children.

Warmer summers and milder winters could increase opportunities for year-round outdoor recreation and leisure.Changes to marine le could also provide an opportunity, the report claims, adding that ldquowarmer waters may see the arrival of new commercial fish species, which could boost the local fishing industry.It even manages to find a positive in predictions that substantial smog episodes, which were seen in  in Europe, could become typical by , increasing summer pollution.It said: ldquoEpisodes of winter smog, by contrast, are likely to be less prevalent due to higher wind speeds which will help disperse pollutants.A warmer climate could also, the report says, improve residentsrsquo health by encouraging more outdoor activities in the summer and reducing a reliance on heating helping reduce fuel poverty.However, the report was unable to come up with the positives when it came to the impact on emergency services and coastal erosion, both of which only identied risks.The council has launched a public consultation on its draft climate change strategy for the next five years.It aims to reduce its carbon emissions by . per cent annually and work towards a zero waste target.It said: ldquoThe strategy sets out how the council will tackle climate change, and how it will work in partnership with our local communities, businesses, organisations and iniduals to ensure that East Lothian can play its full part in the national and international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.ldquoThe strategy will contribute to raising awareness of climate change challenges and opportunities in EastLothian.ldquoIt also sets out the priorities and actions for the council and the wider East Lothian community to mitigate against and reduce the impactsof climate change and the inequalities that can result.Among the councilrsquos proposals to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions are: continuing to improve the energy efficiency of homes and public buildings reduce, reuse and recycle waste improving active travel and sustainable transport networks and promoting behaviour change to more sustainable travel choices supporting local businesses to improve resource efficiency and sustainability and managing the natural environment to off-set carbon emissions.An eight-week consultation period on the draft strategy is open.Angela Leitch, council chief executive, said: ldquoThe draft climate change strategy is an important piece of work which sets out how the council will tackle climate change locally and also how it will work in partnership to ensure that East Lothian as a community can play its full part in the national and international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.ldquoClimate change is one of the defining issues of our times.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on what type of development will be acceptable and where.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  March on the Tories  not the BBC  over free TV licences","story":"Older folk on this side of the Atlantic are indeed preparing to change out of their slippers, albeit for a very dferent cause. Thousands of pensioners plan to march this week on BBC sites across the UK in protest at the corporationrsquos announcement that from  it will stop giving free TV licences to everyone aged over , at a cost of poundm a year, moving instead to a means-tested system where only those claiming pension credit will be exempt from paying the pound. annual fee.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabThe National Pensioners Conventionwhich is organising the protest, off the back of an Age UK petition that has already garnered more than half a million signatures, has called the BBCrsquos move ldquocallous and cruel.The NPC claims the issue is ldquouniting generations when the reality, of course, is that universal benefits for pensioners like this one and the winter fuel allowance ndash which costs around poundbn a year ndashincreasingly ides society by age, with the gap between older, private-pensioned, property-rich haves and younger, debt-ridden have-nots growing by the day.What really dispirits me about the outcry over this move, however, is the way in which large sections of society have fallen hook, line and sinker for the Tory ploy to blame the BBC. The corporation was, after all, left in a no-win situation when it was landed with free licences as part of its settlement in . If it continues to fund them for all over s, the very services viewers and listeners say they value, that mark the corporation out from lesser commercial broadcasters ndash the peerless radio output, BBC and BBC ndash would have to go.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabAnd make no mistake, this isnrsquot just an opportunistic shting of responsibility for an unpopular policy from Government to BBC, though it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe a broadcaster would or should be in charge of welfare policy. Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":null,"title":"read-the-heralds-new-glasgow-property-times-magazine","story":"Glasgow is definitely a city on the up ... and no longer just in the few square miles around the famous university.Throughout the city, buyers are falling for chic open-plan apartment buildings, leafy Victorian suburbs filled with heritage, and lively neighbourhoods packed with bars, cafes and green spaces.No matter whether you are looking for a first-time buy, a family home close to good schools, or an easymaintenance downsizer ...

Had the full long-term impact of the treaties been similarly recognised by the wider UK public we would probably have also had a referendum in  but we didnrsquot.

This would mean massive public expenditure cuts and the application of VAT to items such as childrens clothing and shoes.Pensioners would not be facing paying for their BBC services, but would be coming to terms with John Swinneys report from  which showed that Scotland could not afford to sustain their incomes at current levels.And Scotlandrsquos Prime Minister would not most likely be Boris Johnson, but a man who has been charged ndash though denies ndash nine charges of sexual assault, two of attempted rape, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace.Thank God we voted No.Peter A Russell,Glasgow G.Peter A Russell Glasgow G.THE new runway for Heathrow appears to have been given the green light.

And Age Scotland says this means that large numbers of older people already struggling to make ends meet would have to find an extra pound per week from their basic pension.In a joint statement, the BBCs chairman, Sir David Clementi, and director general Tony Hall said continuing the Governments scheme would have had a \"severe impact\" on services and that the new model \"represents the fairest possible outcome\".The new bill is seeking to amend the Digital Economy Act  to transfer the responsibility for TV licence fee concessions in relation to age back to government."},{"url":null,"title":"beef event one of the best yet","story":"Early morning rain failed to deter farmers from attending the Scottish Beef Association#s Scotland#s Beef Event  held last month on a leading Aberdeenshire beef farm.Around , people streamed into North Bethelnie Farm, near Oldmeldrum, on Thursday, May .Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, speaking at the opening ceremony“It was a very successful day and generally recognised as one of the best of the biennial beef events the SBA has organised over the years,” said SBA vice-chairman, David Barron, who chaired the organising committee.“The  trade stands reported good business and the extensive technical demonstration area was thronged throughout the day with farmers keen to pick up all the latest technology for the beef industry.”Mr Barron was full of praise for the host farmers, Robbie and Barbara Milne, and their son, James, who put on a great show.One of the highlights of the day was the tour of the  acre all-grass farm – with no fewer than  tractors and trailers at the ready to avoid queuing – which took visitors right to the top of the hill, where they were treated to an ice-cream from neighbouring farmers, Mackie’s, while enjoying magnicent views of the Aberdeenshire countryside looking up to Bennachie.Beef farmers – like all farmers and indeed the whole of industry – are facing an uncertain future as the debacle and stalemate of the Brexit negotiations continues.The only thing farmers can do is to make sure they are operating as efficiently and productively as possible so they are in a strong position to cope with whatever hits them in the future – in or out of Europe – and they had plenty of pointers at the Beef Event which more than lived up to its theme - Breeding, Feeding, Succeeding.Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, who in giving the official opening address, reiterated his support for the beef industry and determination to reverse the continuing decline in the national beef herd.But saying is not doing although, in fairness to Mr Ewing, he dropped more than a broad hint that the Scottish Government is looking at an emergency support package for the beef sector. This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"council to make final call on parking fees","story":"Councillors are poised to formally rubber-stamp plans which will see the scrapping of free parking at every Aberdeenshire pay and display car-park.Following both statutory and public consultations in the Spring, the findings are being brought before Thursday’s meeting of the council’s Infrastructure Service Committee .However, despite objections being received, officers do not believe they present any fundamental reason for changes to the council’s original decision made back in January.They are recommending that the council proceeds with the introduction of agreed new tarfs which would see the first hour’s parking costing p, followed by £ for one to two hours, £ for two to five hours and £ for over five hours.Despite massive public and business opposition to the proposals, the council maintains that it is facing a projected £, car-park budget deficit for the current financial year.Prior to the introduction of the free tarfs in  there had been around , transactions annually in its car parks, but while that has risen to . million in  , some  percent were free.Earlier this year head of transportation Ewan Wallace said that running the off-street car parks was now being done at a deficit and was putting “pressure on other council departments”.He said officers had examined ious scenarios and were convinced that the dropping of free parking and the introduction of smaller charges would be the most effective way to reduce the funding gap.However, representations from both the statutory and public consultations insist it will hit businesses and rural customers during an already dficult economic climate.In its response, business improvement group Rediscover Peterhead writes: “The removal of a free parking period would be an additional hurdle to visiting the town centre and will likely drive away customers and visitors effectively reversing the pattern that the free periods initiated in .“The overwhelming majority of town centre businesses polled are against the proposed change to the free parking period. Rediscover Peterhead, as an organisation representing these businesses and their wider economic future, are against the removal of the free parking period.“Further we consider collaborative working with all organisations to be a fundamental part of a Business Improvement District and its success and in this instance the view contained here we expect to be very much considered in the decision-making process, rather than a simple box-ticking consultation exercise.”The Federation of Small Businesses has also waded into the debate, warning Aberdeenshire Council to study and review the impact that parking charges have had in the neighbouring Angus Council area.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The event will be held at the Garioch Heritage Centre\"  Dementia Strategy to be developedviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Bread Guys Bakerys award winning Brioche Buns\"  Award success for Inverurie bakery viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It states: “Since November , there have been reports of businesses across dferent sectors in Angus forced to close their doors, with many citing a drastic fall in footfall and takings.

Fty ships went to the seabed.In later years, many were later brought to the surface again during one of the most remarkable salvage operations ever attempted.Those that remain – seven vessels in all # attract ers from worldwide and make Scapa Flow the premier wreck ing site in Europe.The programme begins on Saturday, June , and involves talks by experts, performances by the German Navy and Royal Navy musicians, underwater imagery, a theatre piece, the screening of a  documentary on the scuttling – and the chance to explore the seabed wrecks using the latest virtual reality technology.Descendant of those involved in the events are set to come to Orkney, and a special service of commemoration will take place over one of the wrecks and at the Lyness Naval Cemetery.Full details are available on the Orkney Islands Council website: www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S scapa--events-programme.htm and on the Scapa  Facebook page www.facebook scapa copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

They say there will be no hard border and they all say they donrsquot want a hard border, and no one wants the infrastructure again.ldquoBut under the backstop, we would have access to UK market and to the EU market.ldquoOne of my biggest concerns in Derry is that dissident republicans will make political capital out of the fact the Republic will have to put up some sort of infrastructurethere is a no-deal.Keeping the Irish border open and free-flowing has been the most contentious issue to shape the Brexit debate, and Westminsterrsquos failure to raty the Withdrawal Agreement has caused huge concern in border towns and villages.Front-runner Mr Johnsonsaid earlier this week that the controversial Irish backstop problems could be solved by having checks away from the border.He was criticised after saying that the ldquofundamental flaw in the Withdrawal Agreement is the Irish backstop, adding that he is not pessimistic about the consequences of a no-deal. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Border Communities Against Brexit holding protests on Old Belfast Road--Toni Forrester, chief executive of Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and cross border worker, said that a no-deal would be the ldquoworst possible scenario for border businesses.Ms Forrester travels from her home in Derry and crosses the border to her work in Co Donegal five days a week.ldquoAs a border population, we donrsquot believe there are any upsides to a no-deal. Therersquos been no clarity from the UK government as to how they will handle goods and services, she said.ldquoA no-deal will mean checks and anything that holds up trade just because of where they are is unfair to the region.ldquoWe would feel there is not a great depth of understanding from politicians in the UK about the border.ldquoWe donrsquot have any control over who is the next UK prime minister, but we would be urging all the parties to get a deal that recognises the border and the Good Friday Agreement.ldquoThe peace in Northern Ireland was hard fought for.Oyster farmer Ciaran Gallagher has been working in the Lough Foyle waters for around four years. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Ciaran Gallagher and Maureen Nolan work on their oyster farm, close to Quigleyrsquos Point on Lough Foyle--He has , bags of oysters and is hoping to expand the business to , bags over the next three years.ldquoTherersquos potential to make a really great business out of it, he said.ldquoWe send most of our product to France, and while Brexit hasnrsquot effected us yet, when it does we hope it has a positive impact.ldquoThe British people need a second referendum as I think the majority of them didnrsquot know what they were voting for.Brian McGrath, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said the Conservative leadership debate ldquodid little to reassure its members that the candidates had a serious grasp of the Irish border issue.ldquoLondonderry Chamber of Commerce, with other key local stakeholders, have been involved in a positive discussion with the Alternative Arrangements Working Group, he said.ldquoThis is no doubt a genuine attempt to resolve what seems to be an intractable issue, through the application of a technology-based approach to cross border trade.ldquoWe seem to be in a catch- situation.

It began in subtle ways: discrimination humiliation and mocking treating others as less than human the language of hate.”She went on to make the point that treating others as less than human leads, in the end, to violence. Andwe are to avoid future genocide we need to avoid the factors that lead to polarisation and ision, by treating one another with dignity and respect, particularly those with whose ideas we totally disagree.: Holyrood hears of the ‘darkness’ of Rwandan genocide  years agoOver the last few years, we have witnessed the heat of both the Scottish independence referendum, and then the Brexit vote, with a rise in political discord and ision, and a country ided down the middle. The “othering” of political opponents is something to which we have become accustomed in Scotland in the period since . Hardly a day goes by without the use of insults such as “traitor” or “quisling” being thrown around on social media.To their shame, we have seen leading figures in nationalist parties like UKIP and the SNP tacitly, or even explicitly, encouraging such language, by questioning the loyalty of those who take a dferent view.Some political issues are by their very nature isive, but that does not mean that we cannot conduct a political debate on a respectful basis. We need less ision, less discord, more compassion, and more reconciliation. We are fortunate that in modern times we have never suffered the horrors seen in a country like Rwanda, but that does not mean that there are not lessons we can learn from the experience there.: ‘Rwanda’s Schindler’ saved , lives©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"spfl must not hide truth about sectarianism in football leader comment","story":"The SPFL must allow a dossier on sectarianism in football to be publishedit is to show it is committed to eradicating #Scotland#s shame#.Sectarianism has rightly become known as “Scotland’s shame”. However, as almost everyone knows, it is more precisely described as Scottish football’s shame.Football is the arena in which this mindless prejudice is played out. It’s where the vile songs are sung and the abuse hurled. It’s where successive generations of Scottish children have learned to sneer at and despise people who otherwise might have become their friends. Some who take part appear to have persuaded themselves that it’s harmless fun, a bit of banter, a real-le pantomime where it’s all just a “joke”, however nasty. But for others, it becomes an irrational ‘reason’ for lasting hatred and serious violence. How much energy and passion, indeed how many lives have been wasted in such a ridiculous and thoroughly despicable way The Scottish Professional Football League and the Scottish Government have a dossier that may shed considerable light on the extent of sectarianism as it contains statistics covering two years of matches.: SPFL accused of ‘gagging’ Scottish Government on sectarianism at footballHowever, facing calls from MSPs to publish the figures, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf told Holyrood that he was unable to do so as they had been provided on the basis that this information was “confidential” and not to be published.He had, he said, asked the SPFL to make the document public both verbally and in writing and the league had agreed to discuss his suggestion at its next board meeting. Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson Liam McArthur urged Yousaf to “rip up” the agreement with the SPFL, adding it was “inconceivable” that the Government had agreed to be “effectively gagged” in this way.Having entered into an agreement, it may not be right for the Government to break it, but it is clear that the SPFL has a moral duty to allow the figures to be published.If it does not, the suspicion will linger that Scottish football is not really interested in driving out sectarianism from our national game even though they are ashamed of the information contained in this ‘secret dossier’. The football world likes to claim bigotry is a societal problem, not a football one, but football is part of Scottish society and must play its part. It is often said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyThis is how many points youll get on your licence for these driving offences Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"Police in Craigavon are advising motorists that a road in the Gilford area is currently closed due to a fallen tree.Traffic and Travel,  ..Woman injured in crash outside election count centre in Co DownA woman has been injured after a car ended up on its roof outside an election count in Co Down.Traffic and Travel,  ..Drivers warned of lsquorisk of icy conditionsrsquoThe Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.Traffic and Travel,  ..A road traffic collision is now clearedA road traffic collision on the A has now been cleared.Traffic and Travel,  ..These are the best airlines in Europe, according to TripAdvisorChoosing an airline to travel abroad is typically swayed by price, but paying less money doesnt always guarantee the best service.Things To Do,  ..Two vehicle collision on busy N.I. road causing long delaysA two vehicle road traffic collision on a busy Northern Ireland road on Tuesday is causing major delays.Traffic and Travel,  ..Man dies following crash on A dual carriagewayA man has died following a two vehicle road traffic collision on the A dual carriageway in Co Down.Traffic and Travel,  ..\" title\"The air ambulance. \" \" Two people taken to hospital after serious collisionTwo people have been taken to hospital following a two-vehicle road traffic collision near Dromore, Co Down.Traffic and Travel,  ..Four vehicle smash on MA four vehicle road traffic collision has caused major disruption to morning rush hour traffic on the M.Traffic and Travel,  ..Diesel spill causing serious traffic disruptionPolice are reporting long tailbacks on the A near Dromore, Co Down following a road traffic collision in the area earlier this evening.Traffic and Travel,  ..Temperatures set to plummet tonightMotorists across Northern Ireland are being advised of potential icy road conditions tonight.Traffic and Travel,  ..Sheep causing havoc on AMotorists are being asked to take care after reports of sheep running loose on the A.Traffic and Travel,  ..M crash causing long delaysA road traffic collision on the M is causing long traffic delays.Traffic and Travel,  ..Entire section of M now closedThe PSNI has closed both lanes in a section of the M.Traffic and Travel,  ..Young man killed in motorcycle crashPolice investigating a road traffic collision which claimed the le of a young motorcyclist have appealed for witnesses to come forward.Traffic and Travel,  ..Road traffic collision causing traffic disruptionA road traffic collision in Banbridge is causing traffic disruption.Traffic and Travel,  ..Man killed in two vehicle collision has been namedThe man who died following a road traffic collision on the A between Banbridge and Dromore last night has been named.Traffic and Travel,  ..Travel news: Fallen tree partially blocking Co Down roadMotorists have been advised to expect delays on the A Moyallan Road between Moyallan and Gilford.Traffic and Travel,  ..

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reps and union leaders meet over upskirting","story":"NORTH Belfast political representatives have joined union officials in meeting two teachers who were the victims of ‘upskirting’ to discuss the need for legislation around the issue.The meeting, which took place at Stormont on Monday, comes after the conviction of, Timothy Boomer , who was recently convicted of five counts of outraging public decency in relation to videos he took as a pupil at a Co Fermanagh school in  and .In itself, the act of ‘upskirting’ is not a crime in the North of Ireland, and campaigners have long called for legislation on the issue, which was discussed at Monday’s meeting.Speaking to the North Belfast News, NASUWT official, Justin McCamphill, said:“We held the meeting to give the victims in that case to set out their experiences and to discuss why the current legislation is inadequate.“The women actually had to take a judicial review against the PPS before the case was prosecuted. It was prosecuted under counts of outraging public decency.“The problem with that law is that it doesn’t treat them as the victims – it treats the general public as the victims. The conviction only happened because it was proven to be a public place because there was more than two people present. If there were no other people there it wouldn’t be illegal at all.“We were there to argue for specic laws. There are similar laws in Scotland, England and Wales, but we want our own bespoke laws.”He added: “In the event that the assembly is up and running we will be going to the justice committee and asking them to make a recommendation to the Department of Justice to bring in legislation to address this.”Following the meeting, North Belfast People Before Profit Councillor, Fiona Ferguson stressed the importance of better legislation and culture change to deal with this kind of sexual crime.“These women were let down by their employer, the police and the legal system. At points they were essentially told ‘boys will be boys’ and even when a prosecution was made, it was under common law of ‘outraging public decency’, which means that in the eyes of the law, the public witnesses were the victims, not the teachers who were upskirted. “We need comprehensive legislation that deals with cases where images are taken deliberately and without consent, so that victims can have a reasonable expectation of justice. And we need a societal sht in how we view consent. It is not good enough that in  women feel unsafe in their workplaces. It is not good enough that cases of upskirting are being dealt with in ways that reinforce the ‘boys will be boys’ culture that justies sexual crime.“The DoJ proposes to adopt the voyeurism legislation in Britain but it would not have led to a prosecution in the case of these teachers, and that is shows that it is not comprehensive enough.’“These women are incredibly brave for speaking out for other women and girls, and NASUWT should be commended for supporting them and leading th"},{"url":null,"title":"may too pliant in agreeing brexit backstop claims brady","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"talks underway to bring fia world rally championship to northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They say there will be no hard border and they all say they don’t want a hard border, and no one wants the infrastructure again.“But under the backstop, we would have access to UK market and to the EU market.“One of my biggest concerns in Derry is that dissident republicans will make political capital out of the fact the Republic will have to put up some sort of infrastructurethere is a no-deal.”Keeping the Irish border open and free-flowing has been the most contentious issue to shape the Brexit debate, and Westminster’s failure to raty the Withdrawal Agreement has caused huge concern in border towns and villages.Front-runner Mr Johnson said earlier this week that the controversial Irish backstop problems could be solved by having checks away from the border.He was criticised after saying that the “fundamental flaw” in the Withdrawal Agreement is the Irish backstop, adding that he is not pessimistic about the consequences of a no-deal.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Border Communities Against Brexit holding protests on Old Belfast Road Toni Forrester, chief executive of Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and cross border worker, said that a no-deal would be the “worst possible” scenario for border businesses.Ms Forrester travels from her home in Derry and crosses the border to her work in Co Donegal five days a week.“As a border population, we don’t believe there are any upsides to a no-deal. There’s been no clarity from the UK government as to how they will handle goods and services,” she said.“A no-deal will mean checks and anything that holds up trade just because of where they are is unfair to the region.“We would feel there is not a great depth of understanding from politicians in the UK about the border.“We don’t have any control over who is the next UK prime minister, but we would be urging all the parties to get a deal that recognises the border and the Good Friday Agreement.“The peace in Northern Ireland was hard fought for.”Oyster farmer Ciaran Gallagher has been working in the Lough Foyle waters for around four years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ciaran Gallagher and Maureen Nolan work on their oyster farm, close to Quigley’s Point on Lough Foyle He has , bags of oysters and is hoping to expand the business to , bags over the next three years.“There’s potential to make a really great business out of it,” he said.“We send most of our product to France, and while Brexit hasn’t effected us yet, when it does we hope it has a positive impact.“The British people need a second referendum as I think the majority of them didn’t know what they were voting for.”Brian McGrath, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said the Conservative leadership debate “did little to reassure” its members that the candidates had a serious grasp of the Irish border issue.“Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, with other key local stakeholders, have been involved in a positive discussion with the Alternative Arrangements Working Group,” he said.“This is no doubt a genuine attempt to resolve what seems to be an intractable issue, through the application of a technology-based approach to cross border trade.“We seem to be in a catch- situation. There must be Withdrawal Agreement before moving to an implementation period, so the idea that a solution can be found without extending the st October deadline appears very optimistic.“We remain open to innovative solutions, but we must ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tourism ireland chief shocked by airport directors criticism","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn second referendum must have real choices for leave and remain voters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

whittled down to just two candidates on Thursday.Party members will then decide the new leader – and the country’s new prime minister.Here are the MPs left vying for the leadership and where they propose to take the country.– Boris JohnsonThe former foreign secretary remains the clear front-runner, having dominated all the rounds of voting so far.Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the Leave campaign, says Britain must leave the EU by October , regardless of whether a fresh deal has been brokered with Brussels.He has insisted he does not want Britain to depart without a deal, but that the Government must prepare for that eventuality as a “last resort”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson is favourite to be the new Tory leader Mr Johnson was educated at Eton before arriving at Oxford University, where he would associate in the Bullingdon dining club with former PM David Cameron.A journalist by profession, he was first elected to Parliament in  while editor of The Spectator magazine.He would hold two posts as a shadow minister – once under Mr Cameron – before leaving Westminster to take the helm at City Hall for two terms as mayor of London.It was that job he chose to focus on when he launched his bid for the Tory crown, and not his two-year stint as foreign secretary which came to an end last year.Joining his opponents in a TV debate for the first time on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he would lt the National Insurance threshold for the low-paid, but added that there should be a “debate” about the p higher income tax rate, which currently kicks in at £,.Addressing the October  deadline for Brexit, he said it must be met “otherwise, I’m afraid, we face a catastrophic loss of confidence in politics”.Mr Johnson soared past his colleagues in the third round of voting on Wednesday with  votes,  votes ahead of his nearest rival.– Sajid JavidBorn in Rochdale to Pakistani Muslim immigrants and educated at a state school, Mr Javid went on to study at Exeter University before entering finance and then politics.His rise saw him hold several Cabinet posts, including his current role as Home Secretary.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Home Secretary Sajid Javid Mr Javid’s leadership pitch sees him pledge to change the image of the Tories across the country, while stressing his comparatively humble beginnings as the son of a bus driver.He said it was time to follow the Scottish Tories and “leave the short-term comfort zone and throw out central casting” by picking a fresh face.On Brexit, Mr Javid said the UK must prepare for no deal, but insisted he could get an agreement through Parliament by October .In Tuesday’s TV debate, he said it had been a “mistake” to have a flexible deadline, and the October  date would concentrate minds on both sides of the Brexit negotiations.He narrowly survived the third round of voting with  votes.– Michael GoveAnother leader of the Vote Leave campaign, Mr Gove calls Brexit an “unashamedly personal” matter for him.But he has taken a more temperate approach than others, saying he would be prepared to delay the severance beyond Octobernegotiations were making good progress.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Environment Secretary Michael Gove Born in Edinburgh, he was adopted and educated at a state school before winning a scholarship to the private Robert Gordon’s College and a place at Oxford University.Mr Gove entered Westminster in  and held the top jobs at the education and justice departments, before taking his current post as Environment Secretary.Despite the y career in high office, his leadership bid was rocked when he was forced to admit he took cocaine around  years ago when he was a journalist.He tried to get his campaign back on track, taunting his rival and sometimes enemy Mr Johnson for pulling out of his last leadership bid.He highlighted during Tuesday’s TV debate that the Withdrawal Agreement had already been rejected three times, and said “you cannot simply re-present the same cold porridge for a fourth time and ask people to say that’s what they want”.Mr Gove was far behind “frenemy” Mr Johnson in the third round of MPs’ voting, but put on  votes from the second round to reach .– Jeremy HuntThe son of Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, he was educated at the prestigious Charterhouse school before attending Oxford as a contemporary of Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron.He made his wealth after setting up an educational publishing firm, and entered Parliament in the same year as Mr Gove.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt Mr Hunt has been installed as a secretary of state four times and currently heads the Foreign Office.Pitching for Tory leader, he stated his case as a “serious leader” for a “serious moment” in the nation’s history.He warned his party colleagues that the Conservatives would be “annihilated”they entered a general election before Brexit.During Tuesday’s debate, Mr Hunt said he would delay beyond October a deal was in reach, as “ we were nearly there, then I would take a bit longer”.Mr Hunt secured  votes in the third round of voting, putting him in distant second place behind Mr

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

At the end of lap one you could see cracks starting to appear in all the groups.Eddie Doyle could be seen grimacing and cracking the whip in his group with the smell of money on lap five just too tempting.A large scratch group, who would normally race through like a well-oiled machine, seemed to be under a bit of pressure as Watson, Montgomery and McKee started to hit the front. It wasnrsquot long before scratch group had split completely and the three men were on their own.By lap four they were a mere  seconds from catching the last group ahead of them and it was then that McKee would lose contact and fall back to what was left of a scratch group.Behind, racers would try to put groups together as pretty much everybody looked like they were trying far too hard. No one had an easy ride in the bunch with no rest on this course. Laura Wylie would show her form holding on to her fast group until the final laps to take the first female prize. Martina Hawkins was pushing for performance of the night as, having made a slow start, would pick up positions as the lapped ticked by and would take second female.At the head of the race Monty and Watson would push each other to the limit with neither giving an inch. It would come down to a sprint for the victory. With a final effort it would Lindsay Watson who would just take the win from Monty.The final podium place was up for grabs and a sizeable group would be in contention.

outline business case designed to pave the way for a poundm tourism bonanza in Newcastle.It has been confirmed this week that local council officials are progressing the business case for a series of

included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the

unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9559549.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned -

Secondly, we need to know the legal implications for the tens of thousands of workers across the private sector who regularly perform overtime duties.”The Department of Finance said it is in “early discussions with the unions about backdated holiday pay”.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not actual hours worked and overtime.Solicitor John McShane, who represented the PSNI officers, said GB legislation which capped back pay to two years had not been extended to NI.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the matter “must be dealt with in a way that meets the needs of public sector workers” but also protects public services.Sinn Fein NI leader Michelle O’Neill MLA said it is “important that workers receive the correct pay” but that it was crucial to clary as soon as possible the potential implications.All three parties have contacted the civil service for urgent clarication.Veteran Conservatives sceptical about survey claim that six in  Tories ‘would sacrice NI for Brexit’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. railway line reopens after tragic incidentExclusive: Joey Dunlops family issues plea forof highly sentimental items belonging to five-time world championScam warning: PSNI alert over Danske Bank lsquopayment teamrsquo textsHere is the shocking footage of a car being forced off a busy N.I. road and into a hedgeMissing N.I. womanrsquos Audi A discovered near river -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They say there will be no hard border and they all say they donrsquot want a hard border, and no one wants the infrastructure again.ldquoBut under the backstop, we would have access to UK market and to the EU market.ldquoOne of my biggest concerns in Derry is that dissident republicans will make political capital out of the fact the Republic will have to put up some sort of infrastructurethere is a no-deal.Keeping the Irish border open and free-flowing has been the most contentious issue to shape the Brexit debate, and Westminsterrsquos failure to raty the Withdrawal Agreement has caused huge concern in border towns and villages.Front-runner Mr Johnsonsaid earlier this week that the controversial Irish backstop problems could be solved by having checks away from the border.He was criticised after saying that the ldquofundamental flaw in the Withdrawal Agreement is the Irish backstop, adding that he is not pessimistic about the consequences of a no-deal. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Border Communities Against Brexit holding protests on Old Belfast Road  --Toni Forrester, chief executive of Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and cross border worker, said that a no-deal would be the ldquoworst possible scenario for border businesses.Ms Forrester travels from her home in Derry and crosses the border to her work in Co Donegal five days a week.ldquoAs a border population, we donrsquot believe there are any upsides to a no-deal. Therersquos been no clarity from the UK government as to how they will handle goods and services, she said.ldquoA no-deal will mean checks and anything that holds up trade just because of where they are is unfair to the region.ldquoWe would feel there is not a great depth of understanding from politicians in the UK about the border.ldquoWe donrsquot have any control over who is the next UK prime minister, but we would be urging all the parties to get a deal that recognises the border and the Good Friday Agreement.ldquoThe peace in Northern Ireland was hard fought for.Oyster farmer Ciaran Gallagher has been working in the Lough Foyle waters for around four years. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Ciaran Gallagher and Maureen Nolan work on their oyster farm, close to Quigleyrsquos Point on Lough Foyle  --He has , bags of oysters and is hoping to expand the business to , bags over the next three years.ldquoTherersquos potential to make a really great business out of it, he said.ldquoWe send most of our product to France, and while Brexit hasnrsquot effected us yet, when it does we hope it has a positive impact.ldquoThe British people need a second referendum as I think the majority of them didnrsquot know what they were voting for.Brian McGrath, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said the Conservative leadership debate ldquodid little to reassure its members that the candidates had a serious grasp of the Irish border issue.ldquoLondonderry Chamber of Commerce, with other key local stakeholders, have been involved in a positive discussion with the Alternative Arrangements Working Group, he said.ldquoThis is no doubt a genuine attempt to resolve what seems to be an intractable issue, through the application of a technology-based approach to cross border trade.ldquoWe seem to be in a catch- situation.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

of the Netherlands - now supernumerary, or stranger knights - proudly walked to St George’s Chapel with the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge, Duke of York, Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex.Ex-Portadown College pupil Mary Peters was also formally appointed to the order today.Eilish Rutherford, Chairman of the Mary Peters Trust, said: “Everyone at the Trust would like to congratulate Mary on her prestigious achievement on this very special day at Windsor Castle. It’s a huge honour for Mary to be appointed to the Order of the Garter.We are very proud and excited that Mary and the wonderful work and contribution she has made to sport and Northern Ireland since winning her Gold medal in  has been recognised in this way. We will be sharing in the joy of this amazing event and what a privilege that is.”Former Prime Minister Sir John Major, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, a past president of the Supreme Court, and Admiral Lord Boyce, a former head of the UK’s armed forces are also Garter knights and were part of the procession. The Queen, who arrived by state limousine, is sovereign of the order and appoints new Knights of the Garter without consulting ministers.Recipients of the honour are chosen because they have held public office, contributed to national le or served the sovereign personally.Farewell to Rev Thomas Stevenson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article

When I am driving I try to catch up on calls both work and personal and often have a lot of miscommunication with Siri.amUsually a coffee stop in an Applegreen and quick send of urgent emails. pmAfter meetings I’m straight into the car and back to the office for an afternoon of edit viewings and development meetings. I try to be healthy at lunch time but often I don’t have much time so I do keep a supply of protein bars in ious bags and drawers in my desk.pmWe have three or sometimes four edit suites running concurrently and as managing director of the company I like to review all our programmes before they are sent to commissioning editors. When the editors want to keep me happy they know to bring me a cup of Earl Grey tea. .pmResearch and development is the cornerstone of our company so daily catch ups are crucial with the team.  .pmI really need to unwind after a busy day and when I can I nip into a yoga class on my way home. I am truly terrible at yoga but I find it helps to just focus on myself for that hour. pmBack home it is checking home works and begging my elder son to revise for his A-levels. If I haven’t spoken to my daughter who is at university in Bristol, I will Facetime her. My husband tends to do the cooking during the week otherwise he knows he won’t get fed and although we eat healthy food there is often a glass of wine on the go.pmWe try to catch up on television shows that we need to be aware of across all the main channels.  pmThis is more indulgent time and my husband and I have a list of dramas that we stock pile, although I normally only last half an hour before falling asleep.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
