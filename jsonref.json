And it has endeared her to him even more.’Those closest to Charles draw a parallel between Meghan’s dignified forbearance in the face of hurtful comments from relatives, and how the Prince stoically endured public criticism from Princess Diana.‘Whatever they felt inside, they’ve both put on a strong public face and not hidden away,’ said another source.The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle in place of her absent father, has delighted Prince Harry and senior members of the Royal Family. It is an understanding that has been further strengthened by a shared love of art, history and culture, with Charles describing Meghan as ‘incredibly smart’.Charles and Meghan’s bond is revealed in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today by Royal biographer Angela Levin, who spent a year following the Prince ahead of his 70th birthday later this month.    The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle (pictured) in place of her absent father, is said to have delighted Prince HarryCamilla has also warmed to Meghan. ‘Not least because both of them have joined the Royal Family from the outside,’ said a source. ‘Camilla goes out of her way to find time to spend with her, to get to know her and make her feel welcome.’As the tour of Australasia demonstrated, The Duchess’s transition from actress to high-profile Royal has been seamless – something that has gladdened Charles, who believes her Hollywood training has enabled Meghan to withstand intense scrutiny.In addition to the Event profile, The Mail on Sunday has learned from separate sources of a Scottish holiday enjoyed by Charles and the newlyweds over the summer.Charles entertained Harry and Meghan at the Castle of Mey, the late Queen Mother’s remote home in Caithness, telling friends he was ‘tickled pink’ when they agreed to join him.

He said: ‘If we do not do what is needed to support the parks we have – and make sure there are new parks where there is new housing – then it will undermine the health of the nation and increase the burden on the NHS in the long term. I want to see a healthier nation – and we need to support our parks and playgrounds to achieve this.‘The health of the nation is about getting people active. We have massive pressures on the NHS and to make sure it’s sustainable in the long term we need people to be healthier in the first place.      DAWN RAID: Police watch as protesters are evicted from an under-threat park in DeptfordCampaigners who have been occupying their local park for two months in an effort to save it from developers were evicted last week in a dawn raid by dozens of bailiffs.The officials stormed Old Tidemill Wildlife Garden in Deptford, South-East London, at 6am and demanded that activists leave immediately.The protesters had pledged to chain themselves to trees to thwart an eviction notice from Lewisham Council. But more than a week after the deadline, they were caught by surprise. Local resident Harriet Vickers said: ‘Two coachloads of bailiffs charged straight in. There was no liaising. They didn’t give people the chance to leave.’ There were also scuffles as the bailiffs, some wearing masks, surrounded the park to keep people away. Police stood by to prevent a breach of the peace.The half-acre garden – and the adjoining Reginald House social housing block – is part of a site where 209 homes are planned.Critics are unhappy that only 47 per cent of the properties will be classed as affordable.                           Don\u0027t ruin life-saving \u0027natural health service\u0027 Comment by Sir Malcolm Grant, Chairman of NHS England           Chairman of NHS England Sir Malcolm Grant also backed The Mail on Sunday\u0027s crusadeGrowing up in New Zealand, I spent lots of time outdoors in spectacular countryside. There, long-distance walking – or ‘tramping’ – is a national pastime.I came to England in 1972 and have kept up the walking, recently completing the Capital Ring – 78 miles around London.The route passes through lots of London’s parks and green spaces but, sadly, many were largely empty. We seem to have fallen out of love with our parks.This is a worry for the NHS as parks are our ‘natural health service’ offering endless opportunities for us to live longer, happier, healthier lives.Many of our cities have extensive green spaces. They should be full of people enjoying sports, walking dogs and playing games. But poorly maintained parks and green spaces do little to invite walking or play.Parks can play a critical role in keeping us healthy – but only if they are kept open and maintained to high standards that make them places we actually want to visit.Instead, our waistlines are expanding as we choose sedentary lifestyles that place a huge burden on our health. Six million people over 60 live with two or more long-term conditions. Obesity – which can lead to type 2 diabetes and 13 types of cancer – is on the rise. Many of these conditions are not inevitable but are associated with the way we live. And they are a heavy burden on taxpayers.I have spent decades in planning and we all know well-designed neighbourhoods, towns and cities help us lead healthier lives.It is essential to raise the nation’s ambitions a long way above the design of today’s housing estates. We need to design and develop higher-quality places to make it easier for people – especially our children – to live healthier lifestyles. For example, providing safe routes for walking to school or cycling to work and attractive green spaces.Evidence suggests 37,000 premature deaths a year could be prevented through exercise and healthier lifestyles.Health must be at the heart of planning policy and NHS England’s Healthy New Towns programme is leading a new approach. Working with a growing number of developers, we are exploring exciting ways to deliver health and care services.Our ancestors built homes, villages, towns and schools around green spaces. They were central to community life and I believe we need to get back to our heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"Health Secretary calls employers offer free fruit bicycle loans staff","story":"    Matt Hancock (pictured outside Downing Street last week) is urging firms to do more to maintain the health and well-being of their employees The former culture secretary was speaking in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, and in it also urged firms to do more to help ill employees return to work.He said: \u0027The lesson is that employers need to be more engaged when people aren\u0027t well, getting them back to work.\u0027Citing the benefits already in place at the Cornish dairy firm Rodda\u0027s, he said: \u0027It employs 178 staff and places a big emphasis on health and well-being. \u0027Initiatives include free fruit, counselling, bereavement and legal services, cycle to work scheme, and a staff volunteer scheme.\u0027 We\u0027ll ALL pay the price if our parks waste away: Health...Health Secretary orders probe into autistic youngsters...Health Secretary promises crackdown on hospital violence as...Share this articleHis comments come as Philip Hammond announced the biggest public-spending splurge since 2010 – including the £20 billion a year extra for the NHS announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year.Theresa May also today announced that the Conservatives are the \u0027natural party of the NHS\u0027 in an interview with the The Mail on Sunday.This is certainly not the first time Mr Hancock has mentioned improving health in the workplace. Earlier this month he said workers should stand at their desks and hold stand-up meetings to increase their exercise levels.

Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) lighting the first of thousands of flames in a lighting ceremony in the dry moat of the Tower of London as part of an installation called Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers, to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War          A man plays a bugle to signify the start of a minute of silence ahead of the torches being lit for the installation \u0027Beyond the Deepening Shadow\u0027 at The Tower of LondonLast night’s opening display of ‘Beyond The Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers’ with a floodlit bugler on the roof of the Middle Tower playing the Last Post and a minute’s silence.A small procession of Yeomen Warders – better known as Beefeaters – plus the Constable and the Governor of the Tower formed a guard of honour and the first of the 10,000 torches were ignited by a tri-service trio.  In order to represent past, present and future, yesterday’s ceremony was performed by a retired Lieutenant Colonel, a serving midshipman from the Royal Naval Reserve and an air cadet.Out of the shadows, a small battalion of volunteer torch-lighters emerged in pairs. Each night, about a hundred of them have the task of illuminating half a mile of grass-covered moat.          A Beefeater walking amongst the thousands of flames in a lighting ceremony in the dry moat of the Tower of LondonSome turned out to have been volunteers who helped with that great poppy display four years ago. Some had simply read about this venture in the Mail and wanted to be a part of it.Each pair consists of a ‘leader’ with a magnetic wand who lifts the metal cover off each torch followed by a ‘lighter’ who carries a blowtorch on the end of a rod. Despite the scale of the exercise, it took only about 20 minutes before the whole moat was ablaze.‘There’s the same sort of buzz that there was with the poppies,’ said Charlotte Howard, a cook from Hampshire.‘It’s a wonderful atmosphere but it does make you remember all those who lost their lives.’          Yeoman of the Guard lights the first torches in the installation \u0027Beyond The Deepening Shadow\u0027 at Tower of London this eveningFirefighters tackle huge Nottingham blaze as explosions are...‘There are so many people in the House!’: Trump dials back...Share this articleSeveral torch-lighting pairs turned out to be husband and wife, such as Dean and Kerry Rockall, from Bedfordshire.All have been issued with a flame-retardant grey boiler suit (to blend in with the Tower’s stonework) and have undergone several hours of training – not just to tick all the health and safety boxes but to ensure they light their designated ‘zone’ of torches in the correct order. It has all been planned in minute detail by Tom Piper, the designer of the installation.‘We want the flames to spread in “fingers” of light until the whole moat is ablaze,’ explained Mr Piper, a theatre designer who also oversaw the great poppy display of 2014 called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.He has arranged the torches at different heights to create a more dramatic effect.

The entire project has been funded by HRP and private sponsors.           A Yeoman Warder stands amongst the first of thousands of lit flames which form part of an installation called Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers, in the dry moat of the Tower of London, to mark the centenary of the end of First World WarSince the arts establishment and the National Lottery refused any financial support for the poppies proposal in 2014 (the Guardian even attacked it as a ‘Ukip-style’ memorial), the Tower has not asked for arts funding this time.The whole experience takes place to the sound of a haunting specially-commissioned choral work recorded by sound artist Mira Calix. Called ‘One Lighted Look For Me’, it is based on a line from the war poem, Sonnet to a Soldier by Mary Borden, who wrote it while working in a field hospital on the Somme.Smoke wafted over the scene, though this turned out to be dry ice for theatrical effect (the torches use smokeless fuel so do not emit any smoke, fumes or smell).

Finally, at about 9pm, the torches ran out of fuel at the allotted time and, on cue, began to flicker and fade.Another team of volunteers will arrive this morning to refill each canister, as they will each day until Sunday. Unlike the poppies – which are still on display around the country – the torches will then be taken away for recycling.This mesmerising homage to the fallen will not be repeated.

The British managed to advance seven-miles but failed to break the German defence.On the first day alone, 19,240 British soldiers were killed after \u0027going over the top\u0027 and more than 38,000 were wounded.But on the last day of the battle, the 51st Highland Division took Beaumont Hamel and captured 7,000 German prisoners.The plan was for a \u0027Big Push\u0027 to relieve the French forces, who were besieged further south at Verdun, and break through German lines.Although it did take pressure off Verdun it failed to provide a breakthrough and the war dragged on for another two years.                          "},{"url":null,"title":"Unseen pictures lion cub bought Harrods 1969","story":"    Christian the lion having lunch with model Emma Breeze and friends at the Casserole restaurant on King\u0027s Road, London. the lion cub was bought in Harrods’ pet department  in November 1969‘I’ve already named him,’ replied Ace, nodding in agreement. ‘He’s called Christian.’Our visit to Harrods’ pet department that fateful day in November 1969 had been prompted by simple curiosity.As two young Australians newly arrived in the UK, we’d heard crazy tales about a London store where you could buy not just the usual clothes and household goods, but tapirs, snakes, monkeys and even pumas and lions as well.It sounded incredible, but when I saw the beautiful lion cub for sale that day — alert, trusting and magnificent — I was smitten. David Attenborough says too much alarmism about climate...Lion is found emaciated and left to die with its paws...Lion love triangle! Two brothers come to blows during a...Share this article(These were the days before the Endangered Species Act of 1976, when it was legal for exotic creatures to be sold to the public.)And so began our wonderful, rollercoaster life with Christian.Day after day, after the Christmas shoppers had gone home, we’d turn up at Harrods to play with our new pet as we tried to convince his keepers that we’d be suitable owners.Already weighing 2st, he was more than a handful as he leapt around and wrestled with us — an enchanting ball of energy with razor-sharp teeth.          Anthony Bourke and John Rendall take Christian for s spin in their convertible  on the King\u0027s Road. The pair would take the lion in a ride in the car to the churchyard to get exercise and to playPatiently, the staff answered our excited but naïve questions before asking their own: where, exactly, did we think an energetic three-month-old lion cub might actually live?It was a problem. But, as luck would have it, I’d newly started a job in a pine furniture store, Sophisto-Cat, on the King’s Road, whose owner had grown up in Africa. How might he feel about having a lion on the premises?It was an outrageous request, but I didn’t have any better ideas. Surely, I argued, a lion was the ultimate ‘sophistocat’ — the perfect mascot?There was a huge basement which Christian could have to himself, and we’d be on hand to look after him, as Ace and I were living in the flat above the store. Amazingly, the owner enthusiastically agreed. To our delight, the Harrods staff approved we would collect Christian in three weeks’ time.A few days later, we had a call. ‘Can you collect Christian tomorrow?’ It transpired that our new acquisition had escaped the night before and all but destroyed a display of goat-skin rugs in the carpet department, whose manager was less than pleased. What had we let ourselves in for?It was a thrilling time to be in London. Among Sophisto-Cat’s close neighbours were Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, whose boutique later became the birthplace of the punk movement, and opposite was ultra-fashionable clothes store Granny Takes A Trip, where The Beatles, Who, Cream and Jimi Hendrix were customers.           Pampered: Christian gets a blow dry. The lion lived in a huge basement in a pine furniture store, Sophisto-Cat, which Christian had to himselfPerhaps it wasn’t totally outrageous that a lion should be living among such a bohemian set.Christian’s new home was everything we had hoped for: airy, with plenty of natural light and lots of space for a little cub to race around in, often dragging his favourite plastic pig.With bedding, bones, toys and a large litter tray which he used assiduously after only a few days of encouragement, it was the perfect lion’s den.Harrods supplied a detailed diet sheet: a liquid meal with raw egg and vitamins for breakfast, then raw meat — usually chopped beef or rabbit — for lunch and supper, and, as a special treat, a delicious marrow-filled bone at night.Local restaurants and butchers offered steaks that were past their sell-by date, and cut-price meat.Exercise soon became a concern. But where could we take him? The problem was solved by the vicar of the nearby church, who agreed to let us use its grounds just a few hundred yards from the shop. This sanctuary made an ideal playground, with a high entrance gate and brick walls. Residents of the flats that overlooked it would watch from their balconies and shout encouragement, waving and cheering as Christian raced around chasing footballs and — if we allowed him — us. We never received a complaint.Friends would often come to join in. If Christian ever became too rough, we would just stand still and stop the game, and he quickly got the message.Fleet Street photographer Derek Cattani became a regular visitor, and documented Christian’s Chelsea life.We soon settled into a regular routine. The shop opened at 10am. By then Christian had been fed, enjoyed a ride in the car to the churchyard and returned home for a nap, leaving us to get on with running the shop.At lunchtime he would be wide awake again and ready for his first meat meal. Then it was playtime in the den with anybody who was free to spend time with him. By the end of the afternoon Christian was ready for tea.          Christian attracts young admirers as he heads out in the Bentley. Celebrities began turning up. Diana Rigg had no qualms cuddling Christian, but her co-star in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Australian George Lazenby, did not live up to his 007 image and refused to enter the shopHe would then come up into the shop and wander happily around, often opting to sit on a table or chest of drawers in the window where he had a good view.Celebrities began turning up. Diana Rigg had no qualms cuddling Christian, but her co-star in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Australian George Lazenby, did not live up to his 007 image and refused to enter the shop.We were bombarded with requests to hire him for parties, premieres, publicity shots. To most of these we said no, though we did agree to a photoshoot with Vanity Fair, and one with racing driver James Hunt.It was an invitation to appear on Blue Peter that brought an end to Christian’s career as a model. During a rehearsal, he behaved impeccably but by the time of the live appearance, he was bored.Instead of a nice calm chat on the sofa with Valerie Singleton, the whole thing turned into a wrestling match as we tried to stop Christian from running off.Ace and I decided such events were too stressful for him. He was not comfortable away from Sophisto-Cat or his churchyard. Christian was also now a year old and growing rapidly. Heartbreakingly, he would need a new home.We began considering Longleat Safari Park. This was where some of the lions used in the hit movie Born Free — which told the story of how conservationists George and Joy Adamson had reintroduced Elsa, a hand-reared cub, into the wild in Africa — had been relocated.Then a totally unexpected alternative arose. Actors Bill Travers and his wife Virginia McKenna, who had played George and Joy Adamson in the film, were visiting Virginia’s dressmaker, a neighbour of ours in Chelsea.          Christian tackles John during a game of football in the Moravian Close. Residents of the flats that overlooked it would watch from their balconies and shout encouragement, waving and cheering as Christian raced around chasing footballs They came to meet Christian, and asked what we were planning to do with him. We admitted we were still searching for the best solution.A few days later, Bill rang with an idea. He had contacted George Adamson in Kenya to ask whether he would consider rehabilitating Christian there. The great lion guru had provisionally agreed.It was a wonderful opportunity, but a challenge too. Take a fifth-generation captivity-bred lion, born in a zoo in Devon and then sold to us in a department store, to Africa? Could he adapt? And if he did, would he survive?On August 12, 1970, Christian marked his first and last birthday in England. Two weeks later, with photographer Derek Cattani who had come to document the first stage of Christian’s rehabilitation, we touched down in Nairobi, on African soil. His ancestral homeland.George Adamson was there to meet us. This was the man in whose hands Christian’s destiny now lay.Together we set off in George’s jeep for the Kora reserve 250 miles away — Christian’s new home. When we stopped en route at a camp and took Christian for his first walk in Africa, an event of overwhelming significance occurred.Christian spotted a lost cow in the bush and immediately crouched and froze. We watched as Christian stalked his prey — creeping slowly forward and using the low bushes to conceal himself. George was worried, though: the beast’s substantial horns could be lethal. We tried to grab Christian and, for the first time ever, he snarled at us. The episode shook us, but George was hugely impressed at his stalking instincts.That night in camp Christian was wonderfully affectionate. Perhaps it was the excitement of his first stalking, or perhaps he was trying to make up for his earlier aggression. Either way, he dozed off with his head on a pillow and his paw on my face.But we had learned what we most needed to know: our young lion was wild at heart. Everything would be all right.In the summer of 1971, a year after Christian had become a wild animal, Ace and I returned to Kora to see George and, we hoped, glimpse our beloved lion.When we called George from Nairobi he told us not to get our hopes up. Christian was now the head of a small pride — three females and a young male. George hadn’t seen them for weeks.But when he met us at Kora he was grinning. ‘The lions turned up this morning,’ he said. ‘Christian must have known you were coming.’At his camp, George identified a spot for a reunion. He told us he would lead the lions to the brow of a rock, from where they could see me, Ace and a cameraman friend, Simon Trevor, who had been making a film about our story. After that, nobody knew what might happen.As Christian crested the brow he stopped and stared at us. After a few minutes, he walked slowly down towards us, staring the whole time. He looked superb: taller, leaner and less thickly coated, but strong and confident.His body language was self-assured as he approached. ‘Call him,’ George said, unable to wait any longer.And that did it: the moment he heard our voices Christian began to run down the rocky hillside, grunting with excitement. A 300lb lion was now bounding towards us at about 20 miles an hour. We braced ourselves for the impact and suddenly there he was, jumping up to greet us, rubbing our heads, moaning with pleasure and running backwards and forwards between us as he tried to embrace us both at the same time.          Wild at heart: A 300lb lion was now bounding towards us at about 20 miles an hour. We braced ourselves for the impact and suddenly there he was, jumping up to greet us, rubbing our heads, moaning with pleasure and running backwards and forwards between us as he tried to embrace us both at the same timeToday I look at the photos of that meeting and realise how overwhelmed I was by the powerful emotion. At that moment, the gulf between humans and lions had been blurred by sheer euphoria.But that was not the end of the story. In 2006, the film of our reunion was spotted by an English actor named Marc Bolton, who was inspired to add a written narrative and a soundtrack using the Whitney Houston song I Will Always Love You.Today there have been a staggering 100 million YouTube viewings of that brief clip, with interest showing no signs of abating. Christian is one of the most famous lions there has ever been.It’s 45 years since, in 1973, Christian disappeared into the wild for ever, but some time later George heard him mating and was confident that he had established his own pride. Philip Mason, manager of a safari lodge near the Adamsons’ camp, often sees big-maned iniduals that strongly resemble Christian. Could these be his descendants? Philip thinks so.When Ace and I took Christian to Kenya in 1970, there were 400,000 lions in Africa. Today there are fewer than 20,000.As the threat to Africa’s lions increases, we have much to be grateful to Christian for. The video gains him ever more fans and I pray it will continue to help raise awareness among new viewers, and the fight to save Christian’s descendants will gain momentum.There could be no better legacy from a remarkable animal who continues to hold a unique place in our hearts.Adapted from Christian The Lion: The Illustrated Legacy by John Rendall and Derek Cattani (Bradt, £14.99). © John Rendall \u0026amp Derek Cattani 2018. To order a copy for £11.99 (offer valid to November 15, 2018, p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.

Stock photoClaim: Earwigs like to lay eggs in your earsFalseThe belief that earwigs like to burrow into our ears dates back to the writings of Roman author and naturalist Pliny the Elder, who made the claim — but it is false nonetheless.Earwigs do like moist, dark places, but they prefer natural habitats, such as in soil and under tree bark, to ears.Thankfully, an earwig has never been reported to have laid an egg inside a human\u0027s ear canal.Lion of London snaps back: Stunning unseen pictures...David Attenborough says too much alarmism about climate...Share this articleClaim: You can get high from licking a toadTrueUndoubtedly one of the strangest things people have done to elicit a recreational high is to lick a toad — in particular, the cane toad and Colorado River toad, which produce the chemical 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine.While this chemical makes the toads unpalatable to predators, in humans it triggers the release of serotonin, a feel-good substance in the brain, which can also produce powerful hallucinations.Claim: Cutting in half an earthworm creates two earthwormsFalseIf you\u0027ve ever seen an earthworm split in two by a shovel, you\u0027ll have noticed that one wriggling body is replaced by two. But they don\u0027t both become a new worm. While earthworms can regenerate tissue, a tail will only grow back from the half that contains the head.The other half may wriggle for a time due to nerves in the tissue still firing, but it will not regenerate into a new worm.Claim: White sand is made of fish wasteTrueYes, the white famous beaches of the Males are one giant accumulation of fish excrement. But not just any old fish — this sand is formed by the bumphead parrotfish, which feeds almost entirely on coral that contains a tasty type of algae. The coral is chewed into dust and excreted as a fine sand. One fish can produce 90kg of sand a year.Claim: Wasps target human beingsFalseIt may seem like wasps are out to sting you and ruin your picnic, but there\u0027s an explanation for their actions. Worker wasps spend their lives seeking high-protein foods, such as insects, to feed the colony\u0027s young. But, when the last brood has been raised and the worker\u0027s job is done, they look for sugary foods to sustain themselves.    Undoubtedly one of the strangest things people have done to elicit a recreational high is to lick a toad. File photoClaim: Flirty monkeys soak their fur in urineTrueCapuchin monkeys found in forests in Central and South America go to great lengths to woo a mate. One method used by males is to urinate into their paws and rub it into their fur.Females can sniff out the testosterone levels in urine to identify sexually mature males — as well as determining the male\u0027s status in their group\u0027s hierarchy. High levels of testosterone often correspond to a high social status.Claim: An anteater uses its nose to suck up antsFalseThe anteater\u0027s long snout in fact contains both its mouth and nose. If an anteater used its nose to inhale ants, the insects would bite and sting the inside of the nasal canals. Instead, anteaters use their long tongues of up to 60cm, which can be flicked up to 160 times per minute, to lap up the ants before swallowing them.Claim: Octopuses have detachable penisesTrueWhen a male argonaut octopus spots a mate, it launches its \u0027penis\u0027 — a sperm-filled tentacle — in the direction of the female.This appendage \u0027swims\u0027 towards the female, attaches to a mantle behind her head and is stored in a cavity. Females can store the sperm of multiple males in these cavities to fertilise their eggs.Unfortunately for the male argonauts, they die shortly after detaching their appendage.Claim: Male seahorses can give birthTrueMale seahorses are equipped with a stomach pouch resembling that of a kangaroo. After a courtship dance, the female will deposit eggs in the pouch to be fertilised.The male is able to regulate the temperature of the pouch — as well as transfer nutrients through its skin to the eggs. While the male is incubating the eggs, the female produces more to replace those that will hatch from the pouch.Claim: Camels store water in their humpsFalseCamels can survive for more than ten days without water, but it\u0027s not because they carry fluid in their humps.The hump is where the camel accumulates fat. Distributing fat around the body would, in desert climes, raise the animal\u0027s body temperature to dangerously high levels.So how do camels stay hydrated? In addition to having coats and nostrils that have evolved to limit sweating, they drink very quickly, gulping down 200 litres of water in just three minutes.Claim: All birds are monogamousFalseApproximately 92 per cent of the nearly 10,000 species of bird on our planet exhibit a form of monogamy — but a minority do not.For instance, DNA analysis of blue tits suggests that up to half of eggs in a nest belong to a male other than the one tending them as part of the pair.          The belief that earwigs like to burrow into our ears dates back to the writings of Roman author and naturalist Pliny the Elder. File photoClaim: Polar bears eat penguinsFalsePolar bears eat seals, rodents and fish, but not penguins.This is not because polar bears don\u0027t like the taste of them. It\u0027s just that polar bears are found in the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas penguins are almost entirely native to the Southern Hemisphere.Claim: Vulture excrement kills bacteriaFalseVultures defecate on to their legs. Some ornithologists claim this kills any bacteria that the birds may have picked up from standing and feeding among dead and decaying carcasses.However, this is not true. Vultures don\u0027t have sweat glands, so they need another way to cool off. Their legs are well-supplied with blood vessels lying close to the surface of their skin and, as the liquid waste evaporates, it helps them lose heat and remain cool.Claim: Horses are unable to vomitTrueWhen human beings vomit, our stomach is squeezed between the organs in our abdomen and diaphragm, therefore expelling its contents.However, horses can\u0027t do this because they have a powerful valve at the bottom of the oesophagus that prevents food rising up through their gastrointestinal tract.Claim: Some newts stab themselves to deter predatorsTrueIn 1879, Franz Leydig, a German zoologist, observed an unusual trait in the Iberian ribbed newt. When startled, he noted, sharp spines suddenly appeared along its sides.In fact, they are the newt\u0027s ribs, which force their way through the skin to make it harder for predators to swallow them.Fortunately for the newt, it also has a remarkable ability to repair the broken skin afterwards. From True Or Poo?

On the last leg of the visit, the Prince of Wales will speak at the International Conference Centre at the invitation of President Nana Akufo-Addo.While he will mainly use it to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth, Charles was keen to reference the slave trade in Ghana and Britain and Europe’s role in it.He also wanted to use the occasion to highlight Britain’s determination to tackle modern slavery.The prince was visibly moved by a visit to Fort Christiansborg in Osu, a suburb of the capital Accra, during which he was told of its chilling history.Built in 1661, the fort – also known as Osu Castle – was used by the Danes to hold slaves before they were sent to the New World.In the 19th century, it became the headquarters of the local British government.Colombian star of Royal Ballet reveals he used...How the nation will remember next week: Hour-by-hour what\u0027s...Share this article    The Prince of Wales will mainly use his speech to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth (pictured being greeted by dancers at Fort Christiansborg in Accra, Ghana)    Meghan and her mother Doria RaglandIn an unprecedented step, the Duchess of Sussex’s mother is expected to fly in from the US to spend Christmas with the Queen.Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland, 62, is said to have been invited to Sandringham to join her daughter and the rest of the Royal Family.The honour was not extended to Carole and Michael Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge.A royal source said it was ‘a very thoughtful gesture’, adding: ‘It’s a mark of the Queen’s respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesn’t have any other relations in this country – unlike Kate, who has a very close family.’The Middletons have joined the Queen at church on Christmas morning, but stayed with William.                                                     At the bottom were dungeons in which enslaved Africans were kept for up to six months as they awaited transportation.During a sombre moment in searing heat, Charles paused at the foot of the stairs, known as ‘the door of no return’, to reflect on the fort’s horrific past.In his speech today, he is expected to say: ‘The histories of our two nations are closely intertwined, and while today we enjoy shared opportunity, we can never forget that our past has sometimes borne witness to tragedy and loss and, at times, profound injustice. At Osu Castle, it was especially important to me – as indeed it was on my first visit there 41 years ago – that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana’s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom. The appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world.‘While Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery and that we robustly promote and defend the values which today make it incomprehensible, to most of us, that human beings could ever treat each other with such utter inhumanity.’Charles will also pay tribute to the strength of the relationship between the UK and Ghana.He is keen to highlight the country’s role in the Commonwealth and stress how, by acting within the organisation, it can play an important role over environmental issues and rapid urbanisation.He will also acknowledge Ghana as an example to the region and to the world of a stable democracy, a beacon of tolerance and ersity.In his speech, the prince is expected to say: ‘The Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise, to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep seated and deeply integrated.‘No issue is more pressing than that of climate change.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Schoolboy aged 30 told pupils married father two","story":"    Parents complained after a photograph of the pupil was posted online.

Imagine your worst nightmare, being in a minefield where your next move could blow your leg off while being shelled at the same time.\u0027Being put under shell fire is the most terrifying experience.\u0027In the Falklands, I had come from Goose Green to Fitzroy on a chopper and the Galahad was coming in.\u0027We said to ourselves \u0027they\u0027re sitting ducks\u0027, and within a couple of hours the ops room shouted \u0027air raid warning red\u0027.          Mr Hales, pictured at his protest yesterday in Shropshire, joined the army at the age of 18 in 1976 before serving with the Royal Engineers in Argentina in 1982 before also serving in Northern Ireland\u0027The next thing you know is there is a huge explosion that echoed around. I was in a machine gun, and suddenly men are being pulled off the Galahad with limbs hanging off and burns.\u0027Where it happened there were no medical facilities, blokes were taken into a community centre and were lying on the floor, badly burned and screaming. I was right in the middle of that, and you don\u0027t come out of that experience in the same way you went in.\u0027Gus, who is a convert to Buddhism, still suffers episodes where he hears the screams of pain and artillery, but said the worst times were in the 10 years after he had left the army.The former NCO, who reached the rank of sergeant after serving for 13 years, said: \u0027It\u0027s not like my imagination, they are echoing through my mind like it\u0027s seared on my memory.\u0027Every memory comes with an emotional state. I\u0027m not just seeing this, but experiencing the emotions that come with it - 36 years later and it can still tear me apart.          Crowds gathered to support his cause. He began his strike on Monday October 29 outside charity Combat Stress\u0027 PTSD treatment centre in Audley Court in Newport, Shropshire, where he had been receiving treatment before he claims it was cut off in 2016\u0027It\u0027s branded on me like a branding iron on my conscious.\u0027I have learned to not proliferate the memory, because it\u0027s the start of the narrative and if I follow the narrative too far it ends in a complete and utter breakdown. I have to say \u0027don\u0027t go there\u0027.\u0027But that needs training and awareness, and that is what places like this - Combat Stress in Newport - used to provide, and now it\u0027s gone.\u0027The Government is quite prepared to pay the bill for the sinking of the ships and the lost aircraft, but they should put some money towards the after care, because at the moment we have empty buildings and veterans on the streets.\u0027It is a modern day travesty.\u0027When I came back, I was slowly driving myself crazy.\u0027The first real incident I remember was I going out to meet some people and having an overwhelming sense of anxiety that something was about to happen. I was restless. I\u0027d never get a good night\u0027s sleep. I\u0027d always be on the edge, ready to go, always with that sense of being ready to explode into a kind of anger.Gary Glitter\u0027s cushy new prison: Paedophile settles into...Taking a page from Oprah\u0027s book!

We did drills and we were taught to cut people\u0027s throats, you don\u0027t come back from that a gentle being.\u0027You are brutalised, and you\u0027re left with that afterwards.\u0027People talk about flashbacks and for me it would manifest in intense feelings in my body that would literally cripple me.\u0027I wasn\u0027t able to move. I had a great melancholy and sadness of it all and that I was involved in it.\u0027Gus also previously sought help from Combat Stress at a treatment centre called Tyrwhitt House in Surrey where he was given counselling and respite care.But he claims he was discharged from assistance from the charity without explanation by a welfare officer three years ago, and has yet to receive an explanation as to why.He alleges he has been denied a discharge medical report.Gus believes he is not alone and says he has spoken to other veterans with similar stories.He said: \u0027The treatment was very therapeutic, it gave you chance to meet other veterans and get your head together.\u0027What\u0027s going to be there for the next wave of veterans? I don\u0027t want them to be the same as me.\u0027November 11 is the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, where this condition first came light.\u0027It was called shell shock then, it\u0027s now called PTSD.\u0027You can\u0027t have all these gushing parades for our glorious dead when we are treating people who are alive in this way.\u0027This is not political, this is about veterans. It\u0027s about the veterans of the past, the present and those yet to come.Sue Freeth, chief executive of Combat Stress, said she was concerned about Mr Hales\u0027 decision to go on hunger strike.She said: \u0027Mr Hales\u0027 wellbeing is of paramount importance to us. We\u0027re concerned with his decision to stage a hunger strike, especially in this wintry weather, and are keen to resolve this matter quickly\u0027At Mr Hales\u0027 request, our Regional Operations Manager met with him today to discuss his concerns. Unfortunately, he decided not to speak to her. We also offered him the opportunity to meet with one of our clinical team for a mental health assessment, but he also refused this\u0027In the last three years, we\u0027ve offered Mr Hales many opportunities to be reassessed for treatment with us if he wished. Sadly he\u0027s not taken any of these offers up. We have offered him today an appointment with our Veteran Peer Support volunteer.\u0027Due to demand, we no longer offer open ended treatment but do provide further treatment as needed. Our aim is to help people recover their independence rather than remain dependent on us\u0027We really hope Mr Hales will engage with us so we can work with him to resolve his concerns.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3184b71f9d510f0d70749179be738346c8f6a747/0_747_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9828c609d27e06ea0f389bed69aadc62","title":"guido guidi interview photographs suburban italy","story":"He photographs the in-between places, the ordinary and overlooked, rarely venturing far from his home in suburban Italy. Why do the results feel so monumental? We meet a modern master Over the course of his 77 years, Guido Guidi has lived in the same neighbourhood just outside Cesena, a town in north-east Italy between Rimini and Bologna. It is flat, agricultural country, a landscape of straight lines: ploughed fields, a wide horizon, overhead wires, the long trundle of the old Roman road, the Via Aemilia, and the parallel rush of the A14 motorway. It is the landscape of his photographs, too, in which he has summoned up not the picture-postcard version of Italy, with its pretty countryside and medieval towns, but the peripheral, the overlooked and ordinary: the hastily built agricultural building by the highway the straggle of buildings at the edge of town that the visitor usually rushes past. Even when he does venture into the centre – as in a series of images of Cesena from the early 1980s – he offers it up to the viewer as defiantly ungrand, shabby, a place like any other.A new book, Per Strada (On the Roads), which is accompanied by a small exhibition in London, draws together more than 200 photographs from the 1980s and 90s of this closely observed territory. He might show the corner of a rather plain church with a municipal rubbish bin shouldering into the shot or heaps of blackened, weeks-old snow in front of a dingy palazzo with a bricked-up window or the shuttered, blinded facade of a tobacconist’s with a shadow playing delicately over it.For many years, eschewing digital technology, Guidi has mostly used a large-format, 25 x 20cm camera – the biggest and bulkiest he can carry on his own, he says, its negatives the same size as the resulting print. The detail is vast. In a photograph of an ordinary glass-fronted door there is such a material density to the cracked paint on its frame, the brass fittings of its lock, that the fact of the print’s shiny flatness is almost overwhelmed. Reflected in the glass of the door is the image of a tree, slightly distorted by the faint curvature of the pane, and beneath it the ghostly faces of two children flanking the enigmatic black blob of the camera itself.Guidi is a small, neat man in Le Corbusier-style black glasses who speaks in immensely quiet, allusive sentences. He often quotes other photographers – Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Stephen Shore or his fellow Italian, Luigi Ghirri – or refers to the artists of the 15th century, such as Brunelleschi, Uccello and Fra Angelico, of whom he has an encyclopedic knowledge. We speak in his studio – in his house which he shares with his wife, Marta over dinner at a nearby restaurant and finally, over lunch in a local citizens’ club. In these places he is greeted affectionately and sometimes teasingly by other elderly men, most of whom he has known his entire life.He relates his scrutiny of his territory’s edgelands and peripheries to the facts of his own life. “I was born in the countryside,” he says. “There was not yet this ‘edgeland’, but biography and geography are bound together.” Gradually, the margins of Cesena crept outwards and enveloped his home. The motorway was built close by you can see its slip-road arching away, only 100 metres or so from his driveway.“The history of the city is like an egg,” he says. “The ancient city was like a boiled egg, with clear edges bound by walls. Then the city became a fried egg, its edges spread out. Nowadays, it is a scrambled egg, with no form.” When he was a student, studying design and architecture in Venice in the 50s, “we used to talk about this non-shape of the contemporary city. We were thinking about how to represent this city without form in art.” Anyway, he points out, the periphery is not an objective point: one person’s periphery is another’s centre, and “the centre is where you are”. He adds: “If you want, there is a subtle political message – though I would put it no more strongly than that – in my choosing to photograph this room, or one of my neighbour’s houses.”In this age of the scrambled-egg town, the centre is where the old monuments are, but not, for the most part, people’s lives. And, while he acknowledges the importance of photography that captures great historical dramas – political speeches, wars – his work insists on the importance, even transcendence, of the apparently unremarkable. He mentions a recent exhibition in nearby Ravenna devoted to the work of Magnum photographer Alex Majoli, who was born and studied in the city he is known for his work in conflicts such as the Afghanistan war. “There wasn’t a single photograph of Ravenna in the exhibition,” says Guidi, in wonderment.The photographs are often grouped in sequences, so that turning the pages of Per Strada you see a procession of similar shots following one from the other, or sometimes a single building shot from slightly different angles. (One series of his photographs, not part of this latest book, consists of 16 images taken in an empty room in Treviso during a single day all that changes is that the square of light thrown from the window travels around the room). These sequences partly reflect the rhythm of his work. With his heavy camera it takes time to set up each shot, and his process is measured and slow compared with the speed at which photographers shooting digitally can work. “Many times I’m not looking when I press the shutter,” he says. “Chance is very important.” He doesn’t crop: there’s a kind of rigorous honesty to the pictures.Above all, the photographs argue against the idea of a “decisive moment”, to quote the title of Henri Cartier-Bresson’s most famous book – they refute the notion that the photographer’s job is to capture a turning point, a denouement, to depress the shutter at the moment that captures the essence of an event or scene. According to Guidi: “All moments are decisive – and none.” His work is not about the decisive moment but the “provisional moment” – the idea that this moment is one of a procession of many. Very often, they show some kind of aperture – a doorway, a window, the arches of a portico, even the edge of the lens itself. “It’s part of the game,” he says. “After all, a photograph is a frame, and if you put a frame in the picture, you are suggesting that this is not the whole world, that there is something outside.” It’s another form of honesty. With these gentle reminders that the picture is just a picture, he is showing his workings and hinting at his own subjectivity.One of the photographs in the book and exhibition stands apart from the others. It’s not a landscape, but a still life: a dish of impossibly scarlet cherries sitting on a copy of the newspaper La Repubblica. You can’t see the date on the paper, deliberately (though in fact the photograph was taken in 1985, and one of the headlines refers to that year’s Italian presidential election). At one point, Guidi says that he considered using the image as a kind of frontispiece for the whole book. The image is a memento mori: those cherries will rot, that paper will be out of date tomorrow. That effect is all the more accentuated because, like all of the photos in the book, it was taken several decades ago: these other things too have passed, long ago. It’s a reminder that memory and the photographic image are inextricably bound together. As Susan Sontag once wrote: “To remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to be able to call up a picture.” Guidi says: “All photographs are monuments. If you photograph this cup on the table, for example, it gives it importance. And over time, photographs become more and more like monuments.” In the case of Guidi’s pictures, modest monuments to the dignity of the everyday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac6a1a652e53a2540ca3c386ccd16e70315e689/0_448_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1792b6307a2e5cde07b061c2fb8bf9eb 1760w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The migrant caravan in Mexico, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, funerals in Haiti and Simone Biles at the world gymnastics championships – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c040cc5e91f50acdb48520955ba2df8d0bfc6870/0_1461_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc6bf93841b506fd3be8336115af1898","title":"the artist putting rubbish to visionary use in pictures","story":"“I wanted to give trash a second chance,” says Cyrus Kabiru, 34, who makes art – including highly decorative eyewear – out of wires, pins, bottle tops and other detritus he finds on the streets of Nairobi and around the world.

Constantly checking social media, making it impossible to concentrate on a task at hand? Disconnecting and eliminating disruption could be just what you needFrench artist Paul Cézanne once remarked: “It’s so fine and yet so terrible to stand in front of a blank canvas.”Today, the challenge is not so much to begin a task, but to complete it. Digital innovators make a virtue of disruption, but their innovations have also had a more literal impact on our lives. Creative technologies have proliferated – you can make an album in your bedroom, write and publish a novel and create and display your artwork – but so have the number of channels vying for your attention.Any project you begin runs the risk of frequent distraction from multiple sources such as the constant, nagging hum of social media updates, group notifications and message alerts.There is no denying the power mobile phones hold over us. There’s even a phenomenon known as “phantom vibration syndrome”, which is the perception that your phone is buzzing when it’s not.It is a daily challenge to shut off the deluge of stimuli and try to focus, to centre yourself and be imaginative. It was the philosopher Aristotle who first put forward the idea of the tabula rasa: the young mind as a blank slate. In the literal sense, nothing relates to this more than the process of beginning to work on an empty page.Jackie Andrade, professor of psychology at University of Plymouth, wrote a paper in 2009, where she supported the use of doodling as a cognitive process and aid for reducing daydreaming.Pen and paper are the original, and perhaps the ultimate creative platform, providing a physical connection between the mind and a tool for expression. They fuel the imagination and solidify thought.“There was a study (pdf) that compared students writing on paper and those writing notes on a keyboard, and the former came out better in tests. If you’re typing on your computer, whether you get notifications or not, you’re tempted to look in case there’s something there. You’re pulled away in case there’s an email or something might be happening on Facebook. That doesn’t exist if you use a pen and pad. Those notifications are really disruptive, it’s not just reading them, it’s the time it takes to refocus on the task. That’s a powerful reason to write on paper, whether it be real or digital.”What if there was a medium that provided a bridge between physical writing or drawing and the capability of a digital device, but with none of the disruption? Well, there is. reMarkable is a paper tablet that’s so natural and adaptable that it makes notebooks, sketchbooks and printouts redundant. It offers a paper-like reading, writing and drawing experience in a tactile device that filters out the digital noise around you.“There’s a digital epidemic going on right now. Far too many of us are addicted to checking our social media accounts several times per hour, or worse,” says Magnus Wanberg, founder and CEO of reMarkable. “This is forming our habits in a negative way when it comes to our ability to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. We have based our entire product and company on helping people focus. While most tech companies focus on artificial intelligence, at reMarkable we work to enhance human intelligence. This is why we designed the reMarkable tablet with no distractions or notifications.”Find out more at remarkable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

But after the judges of this year’s ObserverCape graphic short story prize had read carefully through the entries, we were all agreed that one had stood out right from the very start: An Artistic Odyssey by Edith Pritchett.Not only did it look great, it also had a beginning, a middle and an end – a harder trick to pull off than you may think over the course of only four pages. Best of all, it was funny. Posy Simmonds thought it was really funny, and she’s one of the most wickedly hilarious people it’s possible to imagine, in person as on the page. (The other judges were, as ever, Dan Franklin, publisher of Jonathan Cape’s graphic novel list, Suzanne Dean, creative director of Vintage Books, Paul Gravett, who runs the Comica festival, and yours truly joining Simmonds as our other special guest was Michel Faber, whose novels include The Crimson Petal and the White and Under the Skin.)But perhaps this shouldn’t have been surprising. As it turns out, the very first graphic novel that Pritchett, a 24-year-old illustrator, ever read was Simmonds’s Gemma Bovery, and it remains a firm favourite (she also loves the New Yorker cartoonists Roz Chast and Edward Steed) no wonder her story comes with a certain Posy-ish waspishness in the matter of modern mores. Inspired by her time at Edinburgh College of Art when she, like most art students, leaned towards the edgy and fantasised about Tracey Emin-style global fame and wealth (her degree show featured a doll she had stitched of herself in the nude), Pritchett’s comic is all bathos. Our heroine dreams, for instance, not of owning some flashy penthouse flat in Manhattan, but of a deckchair for her iPhone. Nor can she bear to take down the poster of Harry Styles from the wall of her studio – not even after she has decided, following a conversion to militant feminism, to devote the space only to heroines such as Frida Kahlo and Gwen John.“I think the cycles she goes through were true of myself and a lot of my peers,” Pritchett says. “A combination of intellectual inferiority and a very keen desire to be important and do something impressive. But I wanted also to try to be honest about my love for pop culture and internet quizzes, as well as my endless yearning for material goods. Perhaps it’s really a confessional piece.” She is “ecstatic” to have won, hoping the prize might help her achieve her long-term dream of making cartoons her living in the future (she’d love to write a weekly strip). In the meantime, she intends to spend (some of) her winnings on “fancy peanut butter”.This year’s runner-up is Jac Clinch, 26, who works as a director and 2D animator at Blinkink animation studios in London. Clinch is recognised for his (also very funny) story Customer Complaint 40569, in which the mixed load setting on a new washing machine causes a tear in the fabric of time and space as a result its owner, Elaine Thrupp, finds herself in the prehistoric savannah approximately 40,000 years ago. Clinch describes it, brilliantly, as a palaeolithic Eat, Pray, Love journey written in the form of a customer complaint letter. “Modern life can leave some of our primal needs unfulfilled,” he says. “But we can’t go back. Thrupp discovers her primal self, but she still can’t let go of that refund she’s owed.”Clinch, whose graduation film from the National Film and Television School, The Alan Dimension, was nominated for a Bafta last year, has been eyeing the ObserverCape prize for a long time (our prize is now 11 years old). “I’ve followed the competition ever since I was a teenager drawing comics in my bedroom,” he says. “I’ve been so inspired by previous winners – and now, as an adult drawing comics in my bedroom, I’m unbelievably chuffed to be runner-up.” His story, which comes with a fantastic punchline, can be read here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5868b7f238a69a88b174744fc5ea3c48e57b8d/0_161_2404_1442/master/2404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22972fdf9203038bed8652dc7578866a","title":"ba passengers sleep on jfk airport floor delay new york","story":"British Airways accused of treating customers with contempt during enforced New York stopoverBritish Airways has been accused of providing “deplorable service” after more than 100 London-bound passengers were stranded in the US for nearly three days due to a technical fault on a plane.Passengers said their children were forced to sleep on the floor of New York’s JFK airport after their flight from Orlando in Florida to London was erted.Flight BA2036 was scheduled to leave Orlando on 1 November at 19.25 ET and arrive in London eight hours later. But after being held up by a “technical defect” and then a ersion to New York, it did not arrive in London until Sunday 4 November, 77 hours late.The airline put up passengers in a hotel for the night in Orlando and returned them to the aircraft after repairs were made. The flight was erted to New York after a further “minor technical issue”. Passengers said many people were stranded at JFK without information, accommodation or access to food or drink for several hours.Ceri Todd, from Mumbles in Wales, said she was on the flight with her husband and two teenage children, who spent seven hours trying to sleep on the floor of the terminal before being moved to a departure lounge.Describing it as “the journey from hell”, she said there were fire engines on the JFK tarmac when the plane landed but no BA staff to greet passengers. “There was a lack of leadership, a lack of strategy and there didn’t appear to be any plan in place for when things like this happen.”Another passenger, Rosie Slater Watts, said her children had to bed down for more than five hours on a JFK terminal floor. She told the : “We were treated with contempt and like we didn’t matter. When we got on the aborted flight, the customer care manager advised us that they weren’t sure the aircraft had been fixed. No way would we ever use BA again.”BA said in a statement: “We appreciate that this was an exhausting and frustrating experience for our customers, and we have apologised for the long delay to their flight. Customers were rebooked where possible and while there were limited hotel rooms available, our teams on the ground cared for customers in our first class lounge providing bedding, food and drinks to ensure they were comfortable during their stay.”The company said it had been unable to find accommodation for all passengers because the New York marathon meant that hotels were fully booked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32029d5bf86442f28cea19a2e6629e84737d30bf/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0680e4eb6b693f75f14a73c30494952e","title":"un rapporteur philip alston uk austerity","story":"Philip Alston to meet MPs and families in hardship before publishing interim reportA United Nations special investigator is launching a two-week inquiry into rising levels of poverty and hardship across the UK, saying he hopes the government is ready for proper dialogue over the human consequences of austerity cuts.Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, is to embark on a tour of some of the UK’s poorest town and cities on Monday, visiting food banks and community groups and meeting MPs, government officials, academics and families in hardship.Alston, who has a reputation as a fearless, plain-speaking critic, will gather evidence on the impact of universal credit, welfare changes, local government cuts, and rising living costs before publishing an interim report on his findings before he leaves the UK in mid-November.He is scheduled to visit Glasgow, Barking, Oxford, Belfast, Newham in east London, Newcastle upon Tyne and Cardiff. He will also travel to Jaywick Sands in Essex, the UK’s most deprived neighbourhood, which last week was used in an political advert for the Republican party in the US midterm elections as an example of extreme social decay.His inquiry will assess whether government policies introduced in recent years breach international human rights standards to which the UK is a signatory, including the rights to food, housing and decent living standards. He will also try to assess the impact of Brexit on poverty.“The United Kingdom is one of the richest countries in the world, but millions of people are still living in poverty there,” he said.A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said it was “committed to upholding the rule of law and rules-based international systems”. It insisted that on an absolute measure of poverty a million fewer people and children were living in hardship compared with 2010.Alston has received nearly 300 submissions from charities, poverty experts and iniduals living on the breadline – a record for a UN poverty audit – and said they “make clear many people are really struggling to make ends meet”.The visit comes at a time of rising political concern about the effects of years of public spending cuts. Last month Theresa May pledged to end a decade of austerity, in part a response to increasing public disquiet over the rollout of universal credit, rising homelessness and destitution, and relentless cuts to social care, council services, schools, police and prisons.Alston said it was important to track the human rights consequences of the UK government’s economic decisions. “Policies of austerity are commonly executed only in response to requirements by the International Monetary Fund or an external source,” he said. “They haven’t been adopted by governments as a concerted and deliberate economic policy.”Ministers will be braced for criticism from Alston, although his recommendations are not binding. His presence in the UK is likely to provoke outrage from right-wing media and politicians. Five years ago criticisms of the bedroom tax after a visit by the UN’s then housing rights envoy, Raquel Rolnik, were aggressively dismissed by ministers as a “misleading Marxist diatribe”.Alston sparked a furious reaction from Donald Trump’s administration earlier this year when he published a withering inquiry report accusing the US president of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy.He described policies introduced or proposed by Trump – including cuts to food stamps, social housing subsidies, and healthcare – as “a systematic attack on America’s welfare program that is undermining the social safety net for those who can’t cope on their own”.The UK government formally accepted Alston’s request for an official visit in December 2017, but it is not yet clear which – if any – UK government minister he will meet. He is scheduled to meet Welsh and Scottish ministers in Cardiff and Edinburgh.Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said Alston’s tour would reveal an affluent country with a growing child poverty crisis. “It is important to shine a light on child poverty in the UK and there is plenty of evidence to keep him busy during his stay,” she said.Food banks and an increase in rough sleeping on the streets of Britain have made rising destitution more visible. Destitution is extreme poverty defined as a regular lack of food, adequate clothing and shelter. About 1.5 million people, including 350,000 children, experienced destitution in 2017, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6ff9726afbcda0941d979534bbc8cf7b5f3da9/0_49_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4431ef32045c63aaa25fb182778ad66","title":"arron banks brexit democracy 2016 referendum","story":"The modern mind recoils from nuance, detail and reflection. Bombarded with digital information, we seek instant gratification, confuse good public policy with instant customer service, and reserve special contempt for those who would delay the Deliveroo of democracy.So it was no surprise that Arron Banks, the Leave.EU donor now under investigation by the National Crime Agency, framed his interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr as just another pesky metropolitan attempt to confuse and obstruct the supposedly simple matter of Brexit. The harder Marr pressed him on the ultimate source of his £8m loan to the campaign, the more irritated Banks became (“I don’t want to get heated with you”). Any authority or source of information that the presenter cited – the Financial Times, the Electoral Commission, the Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee – was instantly dismissed as biased or otherwise tarnished. The most telling remark of the interview was Banks’s disdain for “the number of corrupt MPs who have sat in this seat over the years”.As usual, he postured as the straight-talking tribune of the people, whose will was yet again being challenged by whingeing remoaner liberals. His whole countenance screamed a single complaint: why do you lot have to make things so complicated? Quite how complicated Banks’s financial affairs are, and have been, is now the subject of a criminal investigation. Its outcome ought to be awaited with fretful concern by the Westminster class, with less than five months to go until the UK’s scheduled departure from the European Union.Which is why it has been so depressing to behold the parade of politicians of left and right insisting that the allegations against the insurance and mining tycoon should have no bearing at all upon the way in which we perceive the result of the 2016 referendum. Most ludicrous of all has been the claim of the Corbynite left that social media – the digital campaigning paid for by Banks – played no significant part in the vote for leave. Really? This seems an odd argument, given that the Labour party made extensive use of a specially created social media targeting tool called Promote in the 2017 general election, and that Jeremy Corbyn himself joined Snapchat to record his political travels. Was he wasting his time, too?You don’t have to be a remainer – or you shouldn’t have to be – to be alarmed by the latest disclosures. For more than two years we have been told with bludgeoning certainty that the people have spoken, the verdict is in, the decision is final. But what if the process by which that decision was reached was seriously corrupted?Thanks to the epic work of Carole Cadwalladr and other journalists, a mass of evidence has now accrued that the two main pro-Brexit campaigns were engaged in electoral vandalism, astonishing levels of disinformation and breaches of the law governing referendums. Yes, that evidence is often technical. But is complexity now excluded from the political process and the pursuit of justice? Are we meant to shrug our shoulders and wilfully confuse detail with trivia?The great conflict at the heart of the Brexit process has been the tension between simplicity of feeling and rhetoric on the one hand, and complexity of fact and negotiation on the other. According to the Sunday Times, Theresa May is close to finalising “a secret Brexit deal”. And it is certainly true that a mood of cautious optimism has settled upon the talks. But much still depends upon political and diplomatic issues that are both extremely complicated and immensely significant. How, precisely, would the UK’s continued participation in the EU customs union affect its relationship with the European court of justice? And what sort of “exit clause” to manage our eventual departure from the EU customs union do the negotiators have in mind? Yes, these are technicalities. But so are the working parts of jet engines and the nanotechnology inside an iPhone: and nobody disputes that they’re quite important.But – if you insist, and just for the sake of argument – set Brexit aside. When Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS select committee, met the FBI in Washington DC to discuss its inquiry into fake news and electoral manipulation, he was struck by the extent to which the Feds’ focus had already shifted from the 2016 presidential race to future elections, including this week’s midterm contests. Its message was: defend your democracy against even more aggressive attacks upon its electoral processes. Think of the next general election, which could come at any time. Or – if you truly believe that vote will not be held until 2022 – concentrate on the elections in 270 English local authorities that will be held in May. How safe are those contests from sabotage subsidised by dark money?Banks is only the most spotlit of a new cohort of digital godfathers seeking to use wealth and technology to manipulate our democratic institutions. He is the John Gotti of populist campaigning, a dapper don who relishes his public profile. But there are plenty of others – state actors and private iniduals – who stay out of the limelight and prefer secret power to boisterous publicity.Are we really OK with this? And, to return to Brexit, is our impatience to get on with this total transformation in our institutional and commercial arrangements so all-consuming that we cannot even contemplate a pause for thought? Call me a remoaner. Call me a centrist. Call me an “enemy of the people”. But don’t insult my intelligence by pretending that there is not a noxious stink emanating from the 2016 referendum campaign.And yes: I know that 17.4 million people voted leave. But 16.1 million voted remain, too. When the margin of victory is that slender, little things mean a lot. And the Banks criminal investigation is more than a little thing. Indeed, we long ago reached the critical mass of evidence where a political class of any statesmanship would have had the courage to suspend the Brexit process and establish beyond question that the original 2016 campaign was conducted fairly. This is no time for bovine paralysis or foot-shuffling timidity. If the satnav is leading you off a cliff, and you think it might have been tampered with, is it really an act of treachery to apply the brakes?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ef946b506048ac3ca8f5cd2cdd7d9e1bc6f095/0_167_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802aa76476105a234d7be03550a0a291","title":"freedom of expression religious views","story":"It is hard to manage the tensions that arise when respect for a religion can be thought to constrain expression undulyMuch of the English-language journalism in global news services is generated in increasingly secular societies, and in newsrooms, places that lean towards scepticism and irreverence. But the world is not so secular. Faith and its teachings and rituals play central roles in many lives.A readers’ editor sees how offence over sincerely held religious beliefs can be easily given, and easily taken. Around Easter, for example, Christians might complain about cartoons in which the burdens of a politician are depicted through references to the crucifixion of Jesus. The cartoonist will typically be thinking topically and pictorially, alluding perhaps to great works of western art. There may be no intention to offend. But a readers’ editor soon hears about the outrage or dismay felt by those for whom the New Testament is core belief and Easter a holy time. Examples could be given for Islam and Judaism too.A free-speech scholar, Eric Barendt, summarised one church’s argument in favour of offences against religion and public worship: that “society is entitled to, or perhaps even should, protect a sense of the sacred. Something valuable is lost if there are no restrictions at all on what can be said or written about God or religious belief.” Barendt continued: “This view is of course contestable. Many people, perhaps now a majority in England, live by secular values, and may prefer that the law makes no attempt to protect what they regard as private, rather than shared, values.” Episodes of freedom of expression for some can be perceived by others as an attack on their religion, and respect for a religion can be thought to constrain expression unduly. Managing those tensions through self-regulation will grow, especially in organisations such as the  that serve online a erse global audience. The law is gradually withdrawing from its traditional role as an enforcer of religious orthodoxy. Not totally, or everywhere, but there’s a trend.On 25 October the European court of human rights had cast a different light on the issue. In a controversial decision that shows the continuing potency of laws criminalising speech critical of religious belief, it upheld the Austrian courts’ punishment of a woman for criticising Muhammad, considered by Muslims to be the last of God’s prophets. She was fined €480, or, in default, six months in prison.Named by the court as ES, the woman had been found guilty of “publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society, namely Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation”. In 2009, ES gave a seminar arranged by the rightwing Freedom party and attended by about 30 people. She questioned whether Muhammad was a model for Muslim males to imitate, given that Muhammad had, according to Islamic scholarship she cited, married a girl of six and consummated the union when the girl was nine. ES had rejected her sister’s advice to “say it in a more diplomatic way”, and, the court found, ES “essentially conveyed the message that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies”. The court found that ES ought to have put child marriages in historical context. It noted that child marriages used to be widespread among European ruling dynasties.The human rights court found that “a religious group must tolerate the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith, as long as the statements at issue do not incite hatred or religious intolerance”, but ES’s remarks had been capable of arousing justified indignation, were not aimed at contributing to a debate of public interest, and could only be understood as aiming to demonstrate that Muhammad was not a worthy subject of worship.Views will differ about the case. I was struck by the courts’ apparent neglect of scale. One stated rationale for blasphemy offences in the past, and for hate speech laws now, is to limit incitement and to keep the peace. A seminar with 30 self-selecting attendees does not seem a potential mob. No mass audience of Muslims was exposed to what ES said.At the seminar was an undercover journalist. Her employer, a weekly journal called N by the court, informed the public prosecutor, and police questioned ES, who was charged.Journalists sometimes work in mysterious ways.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d582fb5747e4985315f388929bd3e09fe9b2042/0_411_5051_3030/master/5051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07987e8ee124815823ae430e458f981","title":"the guardian view on the us midterms blue wave wanted","story":"The United States midterm elections are always important. But the elections on Tuesday matter in ways that few midterm contests can have matched. Yes, it will take more than one election to mend the damaged and angry political mood that, in the last two weeks alone, has seen a fervent Donald Trump supporter send bombs to several Democrats, and a white supremacist commit the most heinous act of antisemitic violence in the country’s history. The man in the White House is not the only thing that must change. But the journey has to start somewhere. You only have to imagine how much more difficult the journey will otherwise be to grasp the exceptional responsibility that rests on the shoulders of US voters on Tuesday.Donald Trump is not the sole reason why American politics have become so toxic, why Americans’ faith in their institutions has been so shaken, or the influence of the US for good in the world so diminished. In many ways Mr Trump was the product of already existing toxicity, shaken faith and declining prestige. But he has turbo-charged this decline deliberately, as a matter of conscious policy. He seeks consistently to be the president of some of the United States, not of the country as a whole. Against those who do not support or agree with him he deploys only hate and scorn. He lies and provokes as a matter of strategy. This is a president without precedent, and although in the US democracy is strong, it is not indestructible.Take the issue of voting rights. It is often assumed that the US constitution embodies a federal right to vote. It does not. Voting is administered by the states. Most states are in Republican hands, and the districts that will send members of Congress to Washington this week have frequently been gerrymandered. In many states, including North Carolina and Wisconsin, Republicans have imposed restrictions on early voting, postal voting and voter identification, all of them designed to prevent black Americans from voting. In Georgia, officials tried to close seven out the nine voting places in a predominantly black area on the pretext that disabled access was inadequate. The US constitution is celebrated for its checks and balances. Yet partisanship is now so entrenched and unbending that institutions themselves are beginning to creak. The White House is in the hands of a lying and rule-breaking racist executive who, apart from all his policy failings, refuses to release his tax returns, blurs the distinction between official and personal interests, meddles in investigations in which he has no business and who deployed thousands of US troops for a purely partisan reason. Meanwhile, since the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation, the supreme court is now more firmly than ever under partisan rightwing control, opening up the near certainty of an attempt to overturn US abortion rights.So there is a strong constitutional case, as well as a strong political one, for recapturing the legislative branch from its dishonest and sycophantic rightwing Republican leadership. Democratic control of the House of Representatives would constrain Mr Trump by investigating issues that have been shamelessly ignored by the current House leadership. Democratic control of the Senate, a long shot, would clip his wings even more. Democratic failure this week, by contrast, would be – and would be taken to be – an electoral endorsement of Mr Trump.This is a pivotal election for Americans, for American democracy, and for the rest of the world. Yet it comes at a time of decent US economic growth and high employment, when Republicans are energised, and Democrats are ided about their future course. It is far from guaranteed, in the light of 2016, that Democratic enthusiasm and money will turn into the blue wave that we want. But there is no more important political task anywhere in the world today than to seize this moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/508b4687c1ed6837e3602bd84e57a8fac518de5b/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39ce4a9eab815f29038db86162c9431a","title":"books cure loneliness closing libraries reading","story":"“We read to know we are not alone,” wrote CS Lewis. He was clearly on to something. A new report claims that books are powerful enough to halt loneliness and social exclusion. The 50-page study, undertaken jointly by the thinktank Demos and the literacy charity the Reading Agency, argues that reading could also assist with social mobility and mental health, and even “hold off” dementia. It backs its argument with an array of compelling research and recommends a government investment of £200m, involving the NHS supporting “book-based interventions”, as part of its social prescribing strategy, alongside a major Comic Relief-style campaign to raise money for book charities, book circles and reading aloud schemes.Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the government heeded this radical advice? We would have a Red Nose Day for books, as well as millions of pounds devoted to reading. I hope the government, and Tracey Crouch’s successor as minister for loneliness, reads the report and listens.But I wonder if they will, because this is hardly the first time we’ve heard about the therapeutic effects of books. Studies have long shown how reading increases empathy, and certain authors  have long been noted as balm for the soul. We know of the long-term benefits of reading aloud to children and how it could give their educational prospects a boost, and of providing books to prisoners.Any bookworm knows that stories can take us out of our interior desolation and transport us intimately into someone else’s life, however troubled it might be – helping us to feel part of a shared humanity. Anna Burns’s Man Booker-winning novel, Milkman, which puts us inside the mind – and voice – of a teenager and her existential loneliness as she navigates life during Northern Ireland’s Troubles, is one example. Libby Page’s 2018 debut, The Lido, dramatising twentysomething loneliness and showing how it might be alleviated, is another. To read about someone else’s suffering can help us to recognise that we are not alone in ours, strangely enough. There is a slew of non-fiction books and memoirs that help us to face our isolation too, like Olivia Laing’s The Lonely City, which focuses the mind on the pain of feeling alone but also its potential value.There is the wider question of what books mean to the iPhone generation, which the report does not address. A story, for a young person whose brain is wired for the habitual flit from Instagram to Snapchat and back again, may just as easily be found in Flash Fiction, or in a Netflix box set.Either way, we already knew how profound and alchemical the reading experience can be, how it can hold our hand like a friend and steer us through the most difficult of times. It is access to this life-enhancing reading material that is the real problem.The report comes as libraries – the largest providers of free access to books – continue to face government cuts and the threat of closures, a stark fact that the report does not flag up, though it speaks of the importance of resourcing library services. A petition that calls on parliament to ringfence library funding and protect public resources was launched at the end of last month, and has so far collected more than 26,000 signatures, including the support of JK Rowling (it needs another 74,000 signatures by March 2019 to force a debate in parliament).This places responsibility for library closures firmly at the government’s door and describes volunteer-run libraries as unsustainable in the long term. This doesn’t sound like the kind of government that will happily cough up the £200m needed to create a society of readers. Libraries sit at the heart of any solution to loneliness through reading – we must know this by now. Where will elderly people, young people, single mothers, unemployed or the partially sighted people access books that they can’t afford to buy if their local library has closed down or has depleted its resources?The Demos report mentions one scheme in Coventry where people were prescribed library books by their GPs for better mental health. Imagine if this became a frontline strategy for anxiety or depression born out of loneliness or social exclusion.My mother, who came from Pakistan to Britain and now lives alone at the age of 74, has spoken to her doctor of feeling anxious and has been offered antidepressants as a result. In an alternate reality, she would be given a prescription for an audiobook or a novel written in Urdu in large print, because of her failing eyesight and her limited literacy in English. But how much would this cost on a national scale?Despite this, the report is hopeful: “Could something as simple as reading truly make a difference when the scale of the issue is quite so momentous? The short answer is yes.”It is a reassuring message but the longer answer for any coherent strategy on reading requires a thorough analysis of where policy is currently going wrong and why. Perhaps it is not even a case of reinventing the wheel: if we poured that £200m back into the libraries we seem so intent on closing or starving, we could magic up the large print and audio books, the reading groups, the well-stocked shelves of stories that could help us in our darkest times. • Arifa Akbar is a journalist and critic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c555b01b6c8f21124bca393d582e629c4a41599/81_173_4726_2835/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f203e22901ac1fb560a9d4dc496381","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

Aimed at helping travellers engage with their journeys and destinations, Riney hopes her sustainable travel logs will help people think about their impact on the world. “I’m starting a campaign #WeHaveNoticed about positive things people have done around sustainability. I believe everyone can make a difference, however small.”Mentor Cathy McCartyColin Sinclair – Snail Offence (snail-repelling copper fences)“We tried everything, from radiator brush bristles to cat fur,” says Sinclair of his quest to stop slugs and snails decimating his plants, without killing them. “They’re like little ninjas.” After trialling several prototypes, including a windmill that lifted the culprits away, Sinclair came up with the copper fence – an attractive, ingenious alternative. He hopes the scheme can help them reach a wider audience. “Now it’s about building the brand.” Mentor Cathy McCartyAmy Paris and Laura Carr – The London Sleep Company (sleep cosmetics and journal)Working in a high-pressured law firm, Paris struggled with her sleep, and would concoct cosmetic blends to help. Testing them out on colleagues, The London Sleep Company was born. Two years of research later, Paris and her fiancee Carr are ready to launch a range. When it comes to a five-year plan, the pair are dreaming big. “We want to be a one-stop sleep shop,” says Paris. “We’d like to add bed linen, and be sold in any sector where sleep is important. To have a mentor’s input to help us will be invaluable.”Mentors Clare Haines and Melissa BurtonMichele Duplessis and Shannon Teague – Pop ’n Sprinkle (sprinkle-on popcorn flavours)The motivation for Duplessis’ and Teague’s business is simple: “We’re obsessed with popcorn.” Moving to London from South Africa, the friends were confused to find just two flavours on offer at the cinema. “In South Africa, you have at least five sprinkle-on flavours,” says Duplessis. Spotting an opportunity, they worked with a manufacturer to develop six flavours, which they’ve been selling online. The next challenge is to build brand awareness and take Pop ’n Sprinkle into the retail market.Mentors Claire Haines and Melissa BurtonEd Spurr – Acorn vases (green gifts)Allowing customers to grow elegant living oak trees from acorns at home, art dealer Spurr’s self-designed glass vases stem from a combined love of beautiful things and nature. First conceived as gifts for his artists, Spurr feels the vases will have wide appeal. “They’ll be interesting to design enthusiasts, tree lovers, botanists, horticulturists and also families with children,” he says. “I think it’s wonderful that from this piece of wood you can grow a tree that’ll become 500 years old.” With the support of eBay he wants to spread his message worldwide. “I’d love people to use social media to share the beautiful trees they’ve grown and start a conversation, one country to another.”Mentor Joanna DaiCatherine White – Sweet Chestnut Designs (Celtic‑inspired head jewellery)After working in the City and a stint as a truck driver, White longed for a more creative job. Studying silversmithing at Glasgow School of Art, she’d already had success selling “sparkly tiaras” but wanted to try something new. She came up with a Celtic bridal circlet, which a friend convinced her to put on eBay. “It sold straightaway,” says White. “That was 2012, and they haven’t stopped selling.” White is now looking for support with packaging and shipping. “I’d like to expand more into America,” she says.Mentor Joanna DaiLindsey Fairbairn – Ledro Design (inidually designed decals)Teaching assistant Fairbairn started her wall sticker business from her home in Chichester. “I was looking for something creative,” she says. “My degree is in design, and I love to craft things, so I came naturally to the idea.” Often personalised, her vinyl illustrations were an instant hit online. She hopes the scheme will help her find the support to scale the business. “I want to employ someone to manage the customer side of it, so I can concentrate on creating more products that’s where my passion lies.”Mentor Gabi CoxLuke Damian-Grint – Bone Shades (Bone-conducting smart sunglasses)Damian-Grint’s innovative glasses use Bluetooth technology to link your phone to a bone-conducting speaker, so users can take calls and use voice-command via vibrations through their skulls to the inner ear. Some similar products are sold in the US, but Bone Shades are unusual in that they run on Google systems, so the tech is always updating. Damian-Grint has started taking pre-orders and, with the scheme’s support, he eventually wants to expand into other products. “I’d like to build it into a technology fashion brand sold in major retailers globally.”Mentor Walter GleesonEmma Orr – Ambassadors of Science (slime kits and science experiments)Looking for a new way to engage her students, Orr decided to shake up her lessons. “I started running science workshops,” she says, “and created a slime kit.” These proved so popular she took the kits online, developing equipment for basic science experiments. Now, Orr has given up her teaching job to pursue her passion full-time. “All my time is spent on this,” she says. Orr hopes the scheme will help her expand as she develops a Halloween box and preps for the Christmas slime rush.Mentor Walter GleesonSimon Basil – Built by Basil (artisan gear knobs from recycled skateboards)Car gear knobs made from old skateboards might not sound like an obvious idea, but it’s certainly a popular one. A fan of Reddit, Basil shared a video of himself making the accessory on the site and, to his shock, it gained more than 400,000 views in a matter of hours. The orders soon started rolling in. “I sell to people who like customising their cars, which is a massive market,” says the former engineer from Lymington, but he’d love some support. “You can’t beat speaking to someone face to face and fleshing out a problem.”Mentors Mo Bro’sDavid Long – Babouche Golf (handmade personalised golf head covers)A trip to Marrakech inspired Long to create his range of golfing accessories. After commissioning a leather maker in the souks to produce a cover for him, he brought it back to his home course. “Everyone loved that it was nothing like the branded covers on the market,” he says. He now stocks 22 styles and sees eBay as the ideal platform for scaling up. “The scheme has given me the impetus to give this everything, because it’s not a side hustle, it’s my future.”Mentors Mo Bro’sEach of our Doers has been paired with an expert entrepreneur to offer advice and guide them through the scheme.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

I hope that the principles and advice we have provided for schools will help them to question their current practice to change this.”The report recommends that the DfE should not request regular attainment data from schools other than its statutory requirements, while Ofsted inspectors should examine if a school’s data collections are efficient.In its response, the DfE said it “accepts all of the recommendations in this report in full. We have acknowledged that data management is a cause of unnecessary workload in schools.”Damian Hinds, the education secretary, signalled his commitment by signing a joint letter alongside Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, as well as leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers.The letter, to be sent to every school leader in England, has “a straightforward message” that headteachers and managers who want to cut back on unnecessary workload will be supported. “None of us wants staff in schools to feel like they are drowning in unnecessary and meaningless data,” the letter states.Tackling excessive workload is a key plank in the government’s drive to improve teacher retention. But it came under attack from Labour for continuing cuts to school budgets, including a failure to fully fund the recent pay rise awarded to teachers.Labour said analysis of research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed that annual spending on schools would be £1.7bn higher in 2019-20 if funding per pupil had been maintained in real terms since 2015.Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said the cuts made a mockery of chancellor Philip Hammond’s “little extra” for schools in the recent budget.“Instead of offering a sticking plaster to schools this government should be genuinely investing in them, reversing their unjustifiable cuts,” Rayner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a458788a3fcbf3011a9061549c45c34a7925099a/24_0_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca3a77f12f9ed34922e1fa1abeaa338","title":"childhood obesity linked to air pollution from vehicles","story":"Research suggests first year ‘critical window’ in which toxic air can increase weight gainEarly exposure to air pollution from vehicles increases the risk of children becoming obese, new research has found.High levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is emitted by diesel engines, in the first year of life led to significantly faster weight gain later, the scientists found. Other pollutants produced by road traffic have also been linked to obesity in children by recent studies.Nitrogen dioxide pollution is at illegal levels in most urban areas in the UK and the government has lost three times in the high court over the inadequacy of its plans. The pollutant also plagues many cities in Europe and around the world.A large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight, leading to lifelong damage to health. Others linked air pollution with birth defects, cot deaths and the first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers’ placentas has also been revealed.The new research, published in the journal Environmental Health, followed 2,318 children in southern California and built on earlier work which had identified traffic pollution as a major risk factor for the development of obesity in children.The research investigated the impact of air pollution from busy main roads, where diesel trucks are common, in the crucial first year of life. They found that by age 10, children suffering high early exposure were almost 1kg heavier on average than those with low exposure. The scientists took a series of other factors into account, including gender, ethnicity and parental education, and think it is unlikely that variations in diet could explain the strong link found.Other pollutants emitted by vehicles have also been linked to childhood obesity. A 2017 study in Boston implicated particulate pollution, while a 2012 study in New York City found the same for children exposed to polyaromatic hydrocarbons while in the womb.The new research was not able to examine how air pollution increases weight gain in the children, but Kim said inflammation was a possibility: “The most common thought is inflammation of body systems like the lungs which may spill over into the entire body – the brain which regulates appetite and changes in fat metabolism.”“This study showing an association between increased body mass in children and exposure to air pollution from roads is important since it is compatible with previous studies showing an association between type 2 diabetes and air pollution in adults,” said Prof Jonathan Grigg, at Queen Mary University London and not involved in the research.“However, more research is needed to explain how toxins inhaled into the lungs affect fat cells throughout the body,” he said. In mice experiments, brain inflammation caused by air pollution has been shown to result in anxiety-induced overeating.A separate new study on asthma, a disease long linked to air pollution and that is the most common chronic respiratory disease in the world, has estimated that between 9m and 33m emergency visits to hospital result from dirty air every year."},{"url":null,"title":"air pollution everything you should know about a public health emergency","story":"It isn’t just car fumes that fill our urban centres with particles. Why is air pollution on the rise, who does it affect most – and what can we do about it?Nothing is more vital to life than breathing: in a lifetime, about 250m litres of air passes through your lungs. Yet walk along a busy city street and you will inhale something like 20m particles in a single lungful.Toxic air is now the biggest environmental risk of early death, responsible for one in nine of all fatalities. It kills 7 million people a year, far more than HIV, tuberculosis and malaria combined, for example. Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organisation director with responsibility for air pollution, is blunt: “It is a global public health emergency.”The lost lives and ill health caused are also a colossal economic burden: $225bn in lost labour income in 2013, or $5.11tn per year (about $1m a minute), if welfare losses are added in, according to a 2016 World Bank report, which called the figure “a sobering wake-up call”.Air pollution is getting worse in the developing world and, while it is getting better in some developed nations, our knowledge of how comprehensively it damages our bodies and minds is growing even faster.Dirty air has been with us for centuries – previously, we simply lived with it – and no one has yet had air pollution as a cause of death on their death certificate. It is only in recent decades that the damage to health has become clear, and in recent years that the health crisis has received widespread attention, thanks to research revelations, government legal defeats and the Volkswagen diesel scandal.But there is a silver lining to air pollution’s cloud of smog: action to cut it not only brings immediate benefits but also helps fight climate change in the longer term.India has almost half of the top 50 most polluted cities in the world, China has eight and Iran has three. Africa is highly polluted but little measured: in 2015 Paris had three times more monitoring stations than the entire continent.Children’s developing bodies are uniquely vulnerable, but 300 million live in places with extreme air pollution, where toxic fumes are six times higher than international guidelines.Yes. The most damaging but best understood are tiny particles. These not only damage the lungs, but enter the bloodstream. They are increasingly thought to enter vital organs, including the brain and have been shown the reach the liver, spleen, kidneys and testes in lab animals.The particles can be made of black carbon, nitrates, sulphates, ammonia or mineral dust. Most are produced by burning fossil fuels or wood, for driving, heating, power plants and industry.While improvements have been made in some countries, for example, to coal-fired power stations and cars, other sources have lagged behind. Farming is one such source of pollution, with ammonia from livestock manure and fertilisers blowing into cities and forming particles, particularly in spring time when crops are sown and muck is spread.Nitrogen dioxide, produced by diesel vehicles, not only forms particles but is now known to cause harm when breathed as a gas. It is still illegally high in much of urban Britain, for example, where it results in about 23,500 early deaths.There are some natural sources of outdoor air pollution, such as dust storms and smoke from forest fires, but human-caused pollution far exceeds these. Outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million early deaths, according to the WHO.This is also a huge killer, causing 3.8 million early deaths. (Some people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor pollution). Half the world’s population cook on open fires with dirty fuels such as wood, dung and charcoal, and kerosene in wick lamps also produces dangerous smoke.Increasingly, it is easier to ask what harm does air pollution not do. Research is now linking toxic air not only to almost every part of the body, but also to the mind.The dangers of toxic air are a surprisingly recent discovery. The landmark research linking air pollution to lung diseases, heart attacks and strokes – the Harvard six cities study – was first published in 1993. Since then dirty air has been linked to many other conditions, such as diabetes. Air pollution contributed to 3.2m new cases of this illness in 2016, according to one study. Kidney disease appears to be influenced by air pollution, as does Alzheimer’s disease. The skin is affected too, ageing more rapidly in dirty air.The research on babies and children is particularly worrying. A large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight, leading to lifelong damage to health. The doctors involved called this finding alone “something approaching a public health catastrophe”.Millions of premature births may be linked to air pollution another study makes the connection to birth defects and another to cot deaths. The first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers’ placentas has also been revealed. “It is a worrying problem – there is a massive association between air pollution a mother breathes in and the effect it has on the foetus,” said the lead researcher.As children grow, asthma and stunted lung growth is a serious issue linked to air pollution, as is the ability to learn in school and the risk of teenage delinquency.The estimated annual death toll of 7 million is certain to be an underestimation, as it only includes particle pollution and the five most firmly linked causes of death, such as heart attacks. Early estimates using improved models suggest a total figure of 9 million from particle pollution.But even this is only “the tip of the iceberg” of harm, according to researchers. That is because the ubiquitous exposure to air pollution is likely to damage the health of almost everyone in some way, even if it doesn’t lead to a visit to the doctor.The rise of concern over air pollution has prompted a plethora of protection products. Masks are now commonly advertised, but experts say they are of limited use unless they have an airtight seal on the face, which is rare.Giant towers, street-side benches and living, green walls have all been proposed to filter dirty air. A new bus aims to filter the air in Southampton, UK, as it travels. Trees can help too, unless they block the breezes that blow pollution away, in which case they make things worse.Other suggestions are pollution-monitoring apps, so people can choose to avoid the worst times, and alternative city walking routes that keep pedestrians away from the filthiest roads.People in cars are often exposed to more pollution than those outside, as fumes become trapped in the cabin. Closing the air circulation in your car before hitting the city centre is certainly a good idea.There is also some evidence that omega oils and vitamin B may offer some protection against the damage caused by air pollution.Yes. The only practical way to tackle the global health emergency is to cut levels of pollution at source. There is an ethical angle too, says Prof Gary Fuller, at Kings College London: “Morally it is not right to make the victims change their behaviour, instead of the culprits.”Poorer people are also most exposed to air pollution. “There are huge injustices at the heart of the air pollution problem,”’ says Fuller. “By using our air to dispose of their waste, polluters are destroying a shared resource and avoiding the full cost of their actions.”The solutions are simultaneously perfectly possible and incredibly hard, because they require little new technology but involve action across many areas, and are usually neither politically palatable – yet – or very profitable to implement.“There are two big transitions we need to have,” says Neira. “One is a healthy energy transition and the other is the healthy urban planning transition. We need to stop the use of coal, to stop the massive use of private cars in cities and make our buildings more efficient.”Coal burning is declining globally and China has shown how industrial pollution can be rapidly curbed. Particle pollution is down by a third, just four years after a “war on pollution” was declared, and eight after Beijing’s air was labelled “crazy bad” when pollution leapt off the charts. But cities around the world are expanding rapidly, with 4.2 billion urban dwellers set to swell to 6.7 billion by 2050.How those expanded cities are constructed is vital, say experts like Fuller: “We will pay a heavy price if we get it wrong now.”. Mobility should focus on walking, cycling and public transport - even electric vehicles throw up particle pollution from road abrasion and brake dust. The remaining cars and lorries need to be set - and stick to - much stricter pollution controls.Buildings ought to be heated and cooled using renewable energy and waste should not be burned without stringent controls.Progress is being made in some places. Some Dutch and Danish towns have turned their back on cars and Seoul in South Korea has demolished 15 expressways in favour of bus lanes and a new river. But some motoring lobbies and car manufacturers remain obstacles to citizens breathing clean air.Neira, a former health minister in Spain, says politicians should play the health card to win the argument: “If you reduce cases of asthma, everybody will love it.” Other reasons for action are the climate change benefits of cutting coal, oil and gas burning and the reduction in obesity that follows more active travel, such as cycling.What must be done to end the air pollution emergency is not the issue, says Neira, it is the lack of serious political will: “There are plenty of ideas and solutions. It takes leadership.”The Lancet Commission on pollution and health (2017) The Cost of Air Pollution Strengthening the Economic Case for Action, World Bank and University of Washington, Seattle, 2016"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7c97a81b2e77822f8ec317f96337c8f614df26/1_0_2720_1632/master/2720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa294c4f6bb7ab9b59c43073b9cfb7b","title":"what to see in amsterdam the design lovers guide","story":"Quirky-cool Amsterdam has long been a draw for the creative crowd but now, thanks to the direct Eurostar service from London, it’s closer than ever. Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

But while the game was a fun, intense contest for the neutral, the Liverpool manager spent much of the first half in a state of agitation, unhappy with what he deemed a substandard display from his team.“Milly was the one who saw it first and was quite – how can we say, was not happy – was animated. That’s good. That’s how it is in a dressing room, there is a lot of men, a lot of testosterone. One is talking – that’s me – and sometimes before I start talking the boys have a few words and that’s all. Milly is a proper leader.”While Liverpool were eight minutes away from a valuable victory, Klopp agreed a draw was a fair result, but Milner admitted their failure to win was frustrating. “When you’re 1-0 up in a game like that you need to see it out and we didn’t do that,” he said. “There are positives. Coming away from Arsenal and being disappointed with a draw is a positive, and also the amount of chances we created. It’s always going to be tough against them.”The draw briefly took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League, before Manchester City’s victory over Southampton on Sunday moved Pep Guardiola’s side two points ahead. “Yes, and I do,” said Klopp, when asked if he has to ignore City’s relentless accumulation of points."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3b4c093ead3f83eda1bb6a8a4263e6fd9c58b31/214_449_1679_1007/master/1679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a910c0c09a629b4cd7cb72d3405390df","title":"manchester city southampton premier league match report","story":"This dismantling of Southampton illustrates how difficult dethroning Manchester City will surely be.

Guardiola’s assessment underlined this, agreeing that most opponents should be frightened of City – but only regarding their opening.City pinned their opponents back instantly from the kick-off. A moment of mild panic from Saints in the area was followed a few moments later by a free-kick. It was hit in from the right by David Silva and though it came to nothing the terms between the sides were about to change.It took six minutes and already cast the contest as a mismatch of Anthony Joshua versus junior-flyweight proportions. Leroy Sané was Guardiola’s sole change from the XI that won at Wembley against Tottenham in their last league outing and promptly showed why he was back.After James Ward-Prowse stepped on the ball Sergio Agüero fed Silva and his pass slid Sané in along the left. In a flash the ball was whipped in and a hapless Wesley Hoedt smashed home for an own goal.Mark Hughes’s men were still reeling when the champions doubled their lead. This time Sterling was provider. The winger appeared to have overrun the ball but managed to turn it across goal and there was Agüero to notch a 150th Premier League goal.The 30-year-old has achieved this in 217 appearances, second only to Alan Shearer’s 212, and had time to miss a golden chance for a second – he hit Alex McCarthy’s legs – before City went 3-0 ahead. Sterling and Sané were again to the fore: the former chipped towards the German and when the ball bounced Silva volleyed it in.City did not face a threat until the 26th minute and it proved an augury of Danny Ings’s penalty strike moments later. When Shane Long crossed, the visiting No 9 was unmarked but could not capitalise.He was about to do better. Ings raced on to a Ryan Bertrand pass along the left and John Stones might have whacked the ball clear. Instead, perhaps due to an Ederson call, he left it to the goalkeeper and as Ings ran on he was pulled down by the Brazilian. The referee, Lee Mason, pointed to the spot and Ings converted for City to concede only a fourth goal in the league, and a first since Newcastle United scored here on 1 September.As half-time approached the home side offered a telling sequence. This was a mesmerising display of passing that took place in the tightest of spaces inside Southampton’s area. Sterling to Sané to Sterling to Sané. He now fed Agüero who nutmegged Hoedt and found Silva. He in turn found Sané who relayed the ball to Kyle Walker who finally took aim, but to no avail.Now, though, came further hurt for the visitors. Agüero picked Cédric Soares’s pocket and turned the ball in from the left. It came to Sterling and his miscontrol worked to his advantage as he gained space and time to collect a fifth of his league campaign.In the second half Guardiola switched Sterling and Sané to the opposite flanks and just after the hour reward nearly came. Agüero fed Sané on the right and the German had a shot that crashed back off McCarthy’s right-hand post. Sterling’s afternoon to remember became even better on 67 minutes when he beat McCarthy for a second time.By the close Sané had made it 6-1 – courtesy of Sterling’s final assist – and City had signalled that they may be even better than last season’s record-breaking champions. It left Hughes frustrated. “We weren’t strong enough in the opening period,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1342ca7d140effbad09225594f676967f2f6a5c8/0_525_4379_2628/master/4379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4b9b4eb54daab619f9a0f103af55ab","title":"does being a doctor make me a better parent ","story":"It’s bizarre to think that doctors make good parents – in fact, the opposite may well be trueI was standing in the check-in queue, sunburned, exhausted and very late for a seven-hour flight from Toronto to London. My wife had, sensibly, returned from the holiday a day earlier. In one arm I held my screaming one-year-old daughter, Lyra. Her folded pram was slung over the other shoulder. I was clutching passports and a nappy bag and surrounding me on the floor were my suitcases and an assortment of carrier bags overflowing with food, nappies, books and toys. Lyra went silent, I felt her abdomen tense, her face turned deep crimson and she forced out a long and resonant fart which sounded far more like it came from me than from her. A little area cleared around me in the airport. For some reason, probably fatigue, I put a finger into the nappy gusset to check that it was just a fart. It wasn’t. Now my finger was coated in baby poo and pretty soon so were our passports, luggage, Lyra and me. She was unfed, unwatered, covered in shit, and we were about to miss our flight.In truth, I knew I would be this kind of parent, even if other people had higher hopes. There is a widespread idea that being a doctor must give you a leg up in the parenting game. My wife, a journalist, is often told: “It must be nice to have a doctor as a husband.”There are superficial similarities between being a doctor – especially an infectious diseases doctor like me – and the first year of parenthood. Faeces is the common currency of both tasks. Viruses abound. A friend who is a paediatrician likes to say that, up until the age of five, children are functionally HIV positive. We’ve had stretches of months where coughs, snot and bouts of diarrhoea have taken turns wrecking sleep for everyone while I remain helpless. Doctors, even infection specialists, don’t have a monopoly on treatment of minor infections. We know very little about what causes them and less about how to fix them. I have a PhD in virology but my mother’s ginger-lemon-honey recipe is the staple antiviral in our house.So far there have been exactly two occasions where I felt skilful as a parent because I am a doctor. First, Lyra was born in a heatwave. I kept her hydrated and avoided admission to hospital for IV fluids even though we were struggling with breastfeeding.The second display of skill came when Dinah had an episode of mastitis, a blocked infected milk duct. We used hands, expression pumps and, of course, a baby, to drain the infected breast. The best moments of parenting are inextricably mingled with the worst. All three of us naked in the bath at 2am, covered in rapeseed oil for the boob massage, the water cloudy with milk, and the fever finally subsiding – a high and low point in equal measure.Of course, simply because I felt skilful doesn’t mean that I was skilful. I did nothing that any parent with a decent amount of common sense and the internet couldn’t have managed. But both occasions have something significant in common: I felt skilful because I avoided medical treatment. Of course this isn’t necessarily skilful I might just have been lucky that nothing went wrong.This is important to say because it’s likely that doctors under-treat their children, likely because we ourselves avoid medical treatment. There aren’t masses of data but we know that what doctors want for themselves at the end of life and what we recommend to patients is quite different. We don’t want to be resuscitated or have dialysis or chemotherapy or feeding tubes. We know that in terms of mental health and suicide we are sicker than average, yet we present late for treatment, often only when compelled to by colleagues or the law.It’s not altogether clear why we reject our own methods. One study of medical patients in the BMJ ides clinicians into perfectionists, narcissists, compulsives, denigrators of vulnerability, and martyrs, none of whom are likely to seek care. A few of us combine these personality traits to make someone who would literally die before seeking the opinion of a colleague.With our children, we may be more likely to miss a broken leg or pneumonia than to turn up at A\u0026ampE with a false alarm. I know that because I have two close friends, both excellent doctors, who missed those very diagnoses. It was their non-medical partners who insisted on going to hospital.Even if I have been skilful twice, there have been many more times when I failed Lyra as her physician. Discoid eczema confidently diagnosed as a fungal infection. (Did I mention that I specialise in infectious diseases? When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.) Diarrhoea that I realised one day had been going on for several weeks without any attempt at diagnosis, all the while Lyra losing a dangerous amount of weight. This fact was only discovered by our excellent GP. We had never weighed her.So, the idea that a doctor would be a better parent is bizarre in many ways. Perhaps the expectation that they would be speaks to the extent that we have medicalised childhood. Or maybe we think skills are more transferable than they really are. Do people who are skilled at something else make better parents? Would you expect Garry Kasparov or Tim Peake or Judi Dench to have “better” children? If you’ve ever met the children of doctors you’ll know that they’re no better adjusted, healthier or less injured than the rest of us.But if being a doctor doesn’t seem to have improved my parenting, being a parent does seem to have improved my doctoring.In the early months, the doctor in me approached my daughter as a set of problems to be cleaned, fed, silenced. I thought parenting was a form of work, undertaken to produce a particular outcome. This type of approach has parallels with much of the problem-oriented, metric-driven way that we practise medicine now.But my wife, and in fact most of the people I know, seemed to have a different idea about parenting. I remember asking a friend why he didn’t do more regimented sleep training with his kids, who kept him up. “Because it’s not very nice for them,” he replied. This was a revelation to me.Professor Alison Gopnik, a developmental psychologist at University of California, Berkeley, uses the analogies of carpentry or gardening to describe different forms of parenting. Carpentry is about the attainment of perfection. Gardening is about creating an environment where life thrives. Now we’re all about gardening.The gardening approach may sound laidback – “I just let her be what she wants to be” – but it still requires a few technical skills. Part of being relaxed is knowing what to obsess about. When I plan, pack carefully, and get the basics of food, water and sleep right we’re all much happier and cleaner.Mainly, I’m lucky that my wife is that rare person who combines being fun with being ferociously well organised, so that check-in scenario doesn’t happen too much these days.I’m almost ashamed to admit the way that being a parent has changed me as a doctor. As I’ve started to see parenting, and Lyra, as things to be enjoyed, I’ve reflected on my approach to a busy clinic or ward round where patients can become units to be processed, problems to be solved.My wife consciously taught me that our daughter is a small human being to be lived with and cared for. When she cries she’s not being manipulative when she craps in an airport queue it is not to annoy me. Nappies aren’t things to be forced on and off as quickly as possible. Hands should be warmed before applying eczema cream.I wasn’t cruel to her but I think I treated her like a patient, trying to solve her problems as efficiently as possible. Many of my patients are unwell and unhappy because of problems I can’t solve: the structural violence of their life and their environment. I can only listen and show that I care. So now I try a little harder to treat my patients, like my daughter, as human beings. I wash my hands frequently with both.Chris van Tulleken appears in Operation Ouch!

I have great friends and a good job. A year ago I met someone through some friends. Nothing happened, we just went out for a few drinks and socialised a bit. But we really hit it off. We had a very similar sense of humour, as well as similar backgrounds. The guy was a bit younger than me, in his late twenties. I found him very attractive and I felt that he liked me too he was very flirty a lot of the time. I think about him a lot. Way too much, probably. He moved away soon after (with his boyfriend) and although we have had a bit of contact (initiated by me) I haven’t heard from him for ages. I just want to know how to get him out of my head. I feel sad that I’ll probably never see him again, although I’m not so stupid as to have ever done anything to ruin my great relationship. But I miss him. We hit it off, had a laugh together, and I feel like there was a connection there. What do you think? How do I get him out of my head? How do I put it in perspective, see it for what it was and move on?Mariella replies Lucky you. What does it feel like? There are plenty among us who would struggle to recall the deliciously unexpected and life-affirming thrill of pure, unadulterated chemistry. The queue of lifers out there (and the prison analogy is intentional) consumed with envy at your good fortune will be a long one. To have enjoyed that delicious frisson, however briefly, with nobody the wiser and without causing harm to those you love, is a blessing of sorts. To paraphrase the anthropologist Helen Fisher, whose Why We Love, Why We Cheat is a TED Talks hit, romantic love is not an emotion, it’s a drive that comes from the craving part of the mind and has a similar impact to cocaine. So struggling to shrug off your addiction is no mean feat.Your encounter is an example of how our lives pivot on fleeting moments. I knew one day I’d have the opportunity to quote my favourite George Michael song and now at last here it is. “Turn a different corner and we never would have met,” he crooned with aching poignancy in a celebration and lament of the transitory nature of fate. But just because an opportunity presents itself doesn’t mean we have to act on it, nor is it compulsory that because our lustful thoughts have been inspired by one person they have to be consummated with the same one! If that were the case, the porn industry would shut down overnight and Hollywood not long after.Enjoying the sensation of desire is a pleasure in itself and not always something we have to chase down and make visceral. So many of the best moments in life are those that remain unrequited, with a question mark forever floating over what might have been. I once danced with a man for the duration of one song and remember it still as one of the sexiest experiences of my entire life. That it never evolved further is probably why it remains so deliciously etched in my memory.In real life we know what comes next: compromise, responsibility and the daily maintenance required to keep any relationship and, later, family afloat. I don’t mean to make it sound workaday there are transcendental moments to be shared even in the longest-term unions. As cold winter draws in, or emotional challenges arise, I’ll warrant I’m not the only coupled-up inidual glad someone has my back. That shudder of pure sexual electricity can be celebrated without being consummated, as valuable a reminder of our sexuality as what we have chosen to sacrifice for the comfort of cohabitation. There is an alternative route where we grasp every opportunity that comes our way, making pleasure our prime consideration with little care for those we damage in its pursuit. Plenty of our species do seem to have decided that life is a free-for-all and each day has to be treated like a looting frenzy, a smash-and-grab through anything you can get your hands on that might please you or add that elusive sense of value to your life. It’s a fin-de-siècle impulse that’s likeliest to proliferate when the world is feeling like an unstable and unfulfilling place to inhabit.The most decadent of dynasties mark their own demise in a descent into self-indulgence on an epically destructive scale – Nero, the court of Versailles, the Borgias. Will Tinder and Grindr prove to be our lyres? Wandering the ruins of ancient civilisations offers the chance to marvel at what they built but also offers a salutary reminder of what was lost. We too will pass and the more we succumb to our basest instincts for gratification the sooner we’ll make ourselves redundant.One of the downsides of locking into a long-term liaison is that no matter what advantages it brings, it rarely continues to offer that magical alchemy that gets you wondering what it would feel like to press skin on skin. Being human often comes down to the tussle between biology and brain, and sexual chemistry is the clearest example. It sounds to me like you’ve got a good life, a great partner and a lot to lose for a rush of pheromones. How’s that for perspective?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d9f2185faa8456b7b84589d76935db8b8211d8/0_250_6450_3872/master/6450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08e2f332dd71aa568b8b02e4a1c1eda","title":"seven ways to address insomnia","story":"From ditching curry and booze to keeping your eyes off the clock, here is a guide for anyone suffering sleepless nightsYour bedroom is for sleep, right?* So stop using it as your living room. It is your sanctuary: keep it tranquil and dark. Your body needs darkness to release melatonin, which in turn helps you sleep – so invest in blackout blinds or an eye mask. Switch off mobile phones and computer screens, as their LED screen blue light is particularly unhelpful for melatonin production. If you need a new mattress, spend time choosing one that is appropriate, and make sure your duvet is the right tog for the season.*Sex is also good. An orgasm last thing can help you nod off.The buzz phrase is sleep hygiene, meaning don’t do anything during the day that might inhibit your sleep later on, and slow down at bedtime. So avoid naps, and go to bed and get up at roughly the same time each day. Enjoy your night-time routine: have a hot bath (it raises your body temperature, which helps you nod off), switch off your devices at least 40 minutes before you turn in, read a book, play soothing music or listen to a “nodcast”.Alcohol can interfere with your sleep cycle – it helps you sleep initially, but wakes you up a few hours later. Avoid big meals in the evening, especially rich, heavy or spicy foods that can cause heartburn and stomach trouble. Don’t drink coffee after lunchtime – 2017 research found caffeine reduces your sleep time and quality.Part of what keeps us awake at night is stress about being awake. So resist the temptation to clock-watch, which can make you anxious: instead, luxuriate in feeling comfortable, safe and warm. Revisit happy memories and tell yourself that you will still function fine tomorrow.If you often lie awake for more than half an hour, either when you first go to bed or if you wake in the night, get up and make yourself comfortable somewhere else with a book or some music. Return to bed when you feel tired – this will help you associate bed with sleep and not with wakefulness.Record your sleep habits over a fortnight: when you go to bed, how long it takes you to sleep, whether you wake in the night. Look for patterns you can change – maybe you sleep best when you’ve exercised. A sleep diary can also help a doctor pinpoint what’s wrong. If all else fails, get checked out: insomnia is linked with depression, and for some people sleep disruption is an early sign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5eed03ce0bea31284b8917846a9053e1df7a576/0_309_2161_1296/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31967f81fb7acfe81f21be3d7730691b","title":"paul dacre ex daily mail liberal brexit hating media speech","story":"Former Daily Mail editor defends paper’s ‘enemies of the people’ headline in speech at Society of Editors conferencePaul Dacre has used his first major public appearance since stepping down as Daily Mail editor to defend his decision to describe high court judges as “enemies of the people”.Dacre, who left the job this summer, said the decision to run the front page after the judges ruled that parliament would have to vote on Brexit helped push the issue of judicial involvement in politics on to the national agenda – and that his critics missed the fact that the headline was a reference to a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen.He admitted the front page could perhaps have been phrased better, saying: “But what the hell. The point needed to be made.”The former Daily Mail editor was making the lecture at the Society of Editors conference in Salford, where he was awarded the society’s first lifetime achievement award.Dacre used a lengthy part of his valedictory speech to criticise the “liberal Brexit-hating media” who “almost always regard with contempt the mass-selling papers which have to appeal to large audiences to survive commercially”.Among other predictions, he said the UK would soon the see the rise of rightwing TV broadcasters to fill the gap left by the BBC, that Theresa May would lead the Conservatives into the next general election, that tech companies that provide “succour to terrorists and paedophiles” would soon be broken up, and that print newspapers would be here to stay for some time.Dacre said there was an ever-growing gap between London-based journalists and the views of the general public. He said: “They aren’t obsessing over #MeToo, or transgender rights, or equal pay for BBC journalists. And they do like Mrs May and think she’s doing a job in difficult circumstances.”He saved particular anger for the , spending 15 minutes of the speech criticising the organisation and its views. However, he later accepted that it was “still a great and important paper” and part of the tradition of a British free press, which ensures rival papers are allowed to make contradictory editorial calls, such as over the Edward Snowden leaks – which Dacre strongly opposed.Dacre said: “I don’t agree with the ’s decision to publish Snowden, who now skulks in the murderous kleptocracy that is Russia. The man was a traitor who should have been arrested and not sanctified. But I also passionately believe the  must have the freedom to carry such stories.”He criticised “leftwing” professors of journalism and said it was a ludicrous topic for academic study, with journalism degree programmes “churning out graduates for non-existent jobs”.Ian MacGregor, the ’s editor emeritus and president of the Society of Editors, said Dacre “has been, without doubt, one of the most successful and influential newspaper editors of his generation”.“The British media would be in an awful lot weaker position without him and his enormous contribution,” said MacGregor, presenting him with a cut-glass bowl.Dacre, who ended a 26-year stint as editor of the Daily Mail this summer, made no mention in the speech of his successor, Geordie Greig.Before leaving the editor’s chair, Dacre gave repeated public warnings to Greig about the risk of moving the Daily Mail’s editorial line away from a hard Brexit, advice that Greig has happily ignored – instead turning his newspaper’s anger on the likes of Iain Duncan Smith for attempting to disrupt Theresa May’s negotiations with the EU.Despite speculation that Dacre would continue to exert power over the paper, Greig has made it repeatedly clear that he answers directly to the Daily Mail owner, Viscount Rothermere. The new editor was not in Manchester to hear the advice from his predecessor.Dacre, who turns 70 next week, is understood to have signed with a literary agency and is working on his autobiography. Asked about this, he said: “Every editor thinks about writing his memoirs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f8617425a315dc54aa9397ad873689e34399f1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a636a209009162b6b90ba88553952450","title":"sky faces loss of disney content as it leaves the ftse 100","story":"Comcast must now renegotiate contracts with the firm it beat to buy Murdoch’s platform Sky leaves the FTSE 100 this week with its new owner facing the threat of Disney, which narrowly missed out on acquiring the pay-TV group, playing hardball over deals to screen its content, which include the Star Wars films and hits from the Marvel universe.Some of Sky’s key TV and film contracts could be at risk after US pay-TV giant Comcast triumphed over Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox – now owned by Disney – in a high-stakes auction.Comcast’s move thwarted Murdoch’s plan to roll Sky into his $71bn (£55bn) deal to sell Fox’s entertainment assets to Disney. Missing out on Sky means that Disney, the biggest Hollywood studio and now owner of the fourth largest in Fox, will be faced with a key decision about the future of its content on a platform owned by a rival.Sky’s current film contract with Disney expires in 2020 and talks over renewing it are expected to include discussions about Fox content, which includes the Simpsons and the X-Men films.One analyst said Disney’s drive to take on Netflix with its own streaming platform puts question marks over its relationship with broadcasters like Sky.“Disney has aggressively set out its stall as wanting to become a direct-to-consumer player,” says Sarah Simon, of research firm Berenberg. “Disney missed buying Sky and competes with Comcast. Disney now doesn’t have any incentive to renew its programming deals with Sky unless it’s on extremely good financial terms.”In the US, Disney has already said it is pulling its content from Netflix, which will cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in annual license fees, as it looks to go direct to consumers with its own entertainment streaming service, Disney Play, next year. The company has already launched a streaming service for its ESPN sports content.Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has said launching its own service is the world’s biggest entertainment company’s “biggest priority” for next year – and it should be viewed as the start of a global play. has learned that Sky has recently struck wide-ranging content deals with two of the other major Hollywood studios. Sources say these deals were extensions of existing agreements and struck well ahead of expiry, suggesting Sky is keen to lock-in prime content early ahead of what will be tough negotiations with Disney.“Owning Fox gives Disney a huge amount of negotiating muscle,” said Simon. “Disney is in an increasingly clear strategic position: continue to sell content to aggregators or go direct to consumers.”Sky’s business has long benefited from paying substantial sums to maintain a stranglehold on the rights to be the first to air Hollywood films in the UK. The company has exclusive deals with the so-called big six studios – Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and Universal Studios – with its monopoly drawing the scrutiny of competition regulators eight years ago.Sky’s deal with Game of Thrones maker HBO, which is part of AT\u0026ampT-owned WarnerMedia, is also up for renewal in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c289800d231c155c43823a0c1b4566fc93b24b5f/0_869_7725_4635/master/7725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a926150510e1a9750a8368e7a633661e","title":"firms switched four day week increase efficiency health happiness","story":"British people work some of the longest hours in Europe, but are among the least productive. Now some companies are shortening the working week to increase efficiency, health and happinessI meet Rich Leigh for a coffee in Gloucester on a Friday, his day off. In fact, his entire company has the day off, because Radioactive PR, the firm led by Leigh, 30, has adopted a four-day week.It is one of a handful of UK businesses that now operate like this: staff still get paid their previous five-day salary, but they work a day less. The company began with a six-week trial and found that they achieved just as much – and there were even signs of growth. The key to the scheme’s success, Leigh says, is how happy his employees now are. “There are two ways to make money in my line of work,” he says, “retain clients and get new ones. Miserable, tired staff can’t do either.”The four-day working week is being touted by some as the answer to Britain’s “productivity problem”. British people work some of the longest hours in Europe: the average British worker takes only a 34-minute lunch break and works 10 hours overtime each week (more often than not, this is unpaid). Yet UK productivity lags seriously behind our European neighbours, who tend to work fewer hours. France recently made it illegal to expect workers to answer emails out of hours, and the average French worker produces more by the end of Thursday than their UK counterparts do in a full week.The EU working time directive sets a limit of 48 working hours a week. Britain is the only EU member that allows workers to opt out of this and work longer hours, a practice that trade unions have argued has been subject to “widespread abuse”.For campaigners, now is the time for a change. There is both opportunity and need, on health, happiness and business grounds. Those who have called for the introduction of a four-day week include the Green party and Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. O’Grady argues that where businesses have increased their profits as a result of automation, that success should be shared with workers in the form of reduced hours: “It’s time to share the wealth from new technology, not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves,” she says.It is thought that a four-day working week would have a particularly big impact on women, given the caring responsibilities and unpaid domestic labour they often end up undertaking. At the very least, it would be one less day of childcare for families to pay for. “It’s made me feel less stressed about coming back after maternity leave,” says Planells. Could she ever go back to a five-day week? “Honestly, I don’t see myself ever leaving,” she says. “Did I mention how many CVs we’ve had in since people found out we went four days?”The four-day week doesn’t mean working 40 hours over four days, nor is it about shift patterns. Rather it is about working a 28- to 32-hour week but being paid for a 35- to 40-hour, traditional full-time job. In Edinburgh, workers at the tech firm Administrate are also four days a week, although the office is open five – some people work Monday to Thursday others Tuesday to Friday.Administrate introduced the four-day week in 2015. “It was an experiment,” says John Peebles, the CEO. “We wanted to see: if we invest in our people, will the financial outcome be better than if we pinched every penny?”Efficiency has made up for the loss of working hours. “In a lot of tech companies, time is lost to overly long meetings,” says Peebles, “or having beers in the last hour. But what if we just worked really hard for 32 hours a week and didn’t have any downtime?” Administrate has rules on keeping meetings short and encourages team bonding to take place in set spaces (regular team lunches, for example).Price is also concerned by the sentiment behind the movement, which he says is, in part, “the assumption that work isn’t good, so you should do less of it”. He points to the phrase “work-life balance”, which “implies that life is not work”, and argues that rather than concentrating on the quantity of work we do, we should focus on the quality.“We should be thinking about workplace happiness and engagement,” he says. “I know there is a lot of awfully dull and repetitive work that would be great for computers to take away. But then there’s other work that is stimulating, and the question is how we create those jobs into the future.”At the heart of this discussion are some very complex questions: what is work? Is there a difference between good work and bad work, and why is some work paid well and other work less so? Commutes in the UK are getting longer as housing prices in city centres rise, and it is becoming increasingly common for people to answer their emails while commuting. Should that count towards our overall tally of hours?Aidan Harper is the founder of the 4 Day Week campaign. He wants to ensure that a shorter working week is universally guaranteed for all workers, either by legislation or trade union bargaining.“In the UK, we have growing numbers of overworked people,” says Harper, “but we also have a growing number of underworked people, namely gig economy employees looking for more work. So one question is whether the redistribution of time, of workload, might help this.“And there is a more potent question about what the economy is for. Surely the purpose of the economy is to create a good life within it, and have a material basis from which you can be housed, have an education etc. But something our economy is not providing for us is time, which we need. The next stage in economic development should not be to generate more stuff, but to create the conditions in which we can live good lives.”Harper points to the role campaigners and everyday workers have in pushing for positive change. The five-day working week was itself the result of negotiations by unions in the early 20th century – observing technological advances in factories, they negotiated for a formal weekend rather than just a single Sunday off.For Peebles, the time is right to reassess. “Business is different today than 30 years ago, when I couldn’t send an email, couldn’t shop online, had to use a fax machine. So why are we working the same way?”In Gloucester, Leigh is keen to beat the commuter traffic and enjoy the rest of his day off. “Most businesses in the UK are like mine, fairly small,” he says, “one to 10 employees and working in the service industry. So all I’m saying is: why not try it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72f7021a85d3c08aef8a4a00a62bb4acb844429a/0_71_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adb3dd463126a291449a84de940fb3fe","title":"pc world cant repair my laptop but wont write it off either","story":"I keep paying for Coverplan despite the fact it has repeatedly failed to fix the problemI bought a Compaq laptop in 2009 from PC World for £449 and took out the firm’s Coverplan at £8.99 a month. I did so because my previous laptop had been damaged, and I was forced borrow money to replace it. In 2014, the USB ports became faulty and I sent it off to be repaired by Coverplan but, when it came back, the problem persisted. Ever since, the cycle of sending it off to have it “fully repaired” only to find the same problem still existed, has been repeated. On the fourth return, the laptop wouldn’t even boot up so I requested a write-off. My frustration is that I’ve been paying this Coverplan the entire time, but have not had a fully functioning laptop. I’m very aware I’ve now paid enough for a replacement laptop several times over, which is galling. However, I’ve been loath to cancel it. PC World says it is only suitable for a write-off when it feels it can’t repair it any more. SWA, GuildfordThis letter is a wake-up call to anyone paying to cover an electronic item – promoted heavily at Currys PC World. If you have been paying £9 a month for eight years plus, that’s more than £800 to the insurer – enough to have bought two new laptops. One of the problems with these policies is often the company will insist on repairing the item even when it would be cheaper to throw it away and replace it. We asked PC World – now part of Dixons Carphone group – and it was quick to offer a solution. It says: “We’re sorry to hear of the issues SWA had in getting her laptop repaired. We have now given her a voucher to replace it with a new machine and apologise for the inconvenience. ”You won’t be insuring the new laptop.

They suggested that a December deal would mean not only a later parliamentary vote but would require spending on no-deal planning and changes to the roles of hundreds of civil service. There is chance of progress being made in order for an emergency summit to be called on Friday, government insiders believe, suggesting it is possible the cabinet will not be directly involved if it was last-minute. “It is high stakes,” the source said.EU officials and diplomats cautioned against the optimism expressed by some about the imminence of a breakthrough, describing the chances of striking a deal that meets both sides needs as “50-50”.Brussels has so far insisted the withdrawal agreement must contain legal text that could keep Northern Ireland in effect in the customs union and single market as Britain leaves.The commission has accepted that an all-UK customs union could be referenced and prioritised in the agreement, with a separate treaty, negotiated during the transition period, filling out the details.An EU official suggested that such a UK-wide customs deal could only replace the Northern Ireland-specific text if it was a permanent arrangement, and even then there would serious legal issues with making such a commitment at this stage.“There is an evolution in the commission’s thinking. From what they originally proposed, there is a shift towards the UK in terms of the UK-wide thing so, yes, flexible, but whether that flexibility will lead to agreement is something else,” the official said.The source said any hope of Northern Ireland-specific customs arrangements being removed would involve a “huge jump on the UK side”.Even with an all-UK customs deal at the heart of the withdrawal agreement, there would need to be Northern Ireland-specific elements in terms of both single market regulatory checks and customs.Exporters entering the Republic from Northern Ireland would, in the normal run of things, need to prove that their goods are from a country that is in a customs union with the bloc and that they have a rule of origin waiver.Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the leading EU thinktank the European Policy Centre, said he did not believe it would be possible for the EU to satisfy the prime minister’s demands, and that the lack of realism in the UK increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit.He said: “I don’t see the EU willing to accept a deal without the Northern Ireland-specific backstop.“What I have found concerning is that people are making very categorical statements that no British prime minister can sign a backstop on Northern Ireland which seems to go against what is agreed in December, and you hear it not from the government but also the opposition. That makes me think we are moving very quickly to a no deal.”EU diplomats have also scorned the prime minister’s suggestion that significant progress has been made on the political declaration on the future trade deal, with the economic aspects described as a “raw nerve” where the two sides are “talking about different things”.The prime minister is seeking a commitment to arrangements, including a common rule book that could deliver “frictionless trade”.Barnier has repeatedly said that this is not possible, and diplomats believe a weaker pledge for trade flows to be “as frictionless as possible” is the most likely outcome.Number 10 has said it would not accept a deal that would be as wide-ranging as some reports have suggested, encompassing May’s Chequers plan for a “common rule book”, as well as leaving the door open for a possible Canada-style deal.“We have said that we will come up with a ‘precise’ future partnership,” the Whitehall source said. “That will not be all things to all men. It will be a detailed political agreement which we can use to forge our future trading relationship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e0ab9e19c3f856b9e8c35e0d36c2de63d770919/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa87b79f2c6ece7a96f148493a9e089e","title":"uk armed forces to scrap residency requirement for foreign recruits","story":"Commonwealth citizens to be allowed to fill ‘largest gap in a decade’ without living in UKForeign nationals will be eligible to join the armed forces in greater numbers, ministers are to announce on Monday, with British residency requirements for service to be scrapped.The ministry of defence will remove the need for commonwealth citizens to have lived in the UK for five years before applying for service.

The earlier referendum was held after negotiations were complete, so voters knew what they were voting for.“In 2016, the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown. Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative.

It’s about people choosing to look after themselves better, staying active and stopping smoking. Making better choices by limiting alcohol, sugar, salt and fat.”He will insist that his focus on people’s inidual responsibilities as patients “isn’t about penalising people” and instead involves helping them make better choices, some of which involve “tough decisions”.However, one leading public health doctor said Hancock’s focus on personal responsibility was “naive” and an example of “victim blaming”.Simon Capewell, a professor of public health and policy at Liverpool University, said the minister was right to emphasise the need for effective prevention of epidemics such as obesity, diabetes and dementia.But he added: “We must recognise the huge power of our lived environment, and avoid naively just focusing on ‘personal responsibility’ and ‘inidual choices’. People do not ‘choose’ obesity or diabetes or cancer. They have just been overwhelmed by a toxic environment.”The big drop in the last decade in the number of Britons who smoke showed that firm, consistent government action was the best way to boost public health, Capewell said.He added: “Mr Hancock can celebrate previous health successes with tobacco control. That success was built not on victim blaming, but on strong tax and regulation policies to reduce the ‘three As’ of tobacco affordability, availability and acceptability.”Ministers need to take similarly tough action now against “the production of the commodities which harm people’s ill health, including junk food, cheap booze and fixed-odds betting terminals,” he said.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, criticised Hancock’s remarks. “From telling people to stand up in meetings to now lecturing people about their habits, while cutting £1bn from health services, isn’t a serious plan for improving the health of the nation,” he said.Hancock is not expected to announce any major measures to aid health prevention. But he will say that much more of the NHS budget needed to be spent on prevention. “In the UK, we are spending £97bn of public money on treating disease and only £8bn preventing it across the UK. You don’t have to be an economist to see those numbers don’t stack up,” he will say at the annual meeting in London of the International Association of National Public Health Institutes.Dr Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, urged Hancock to reduce the toll of lifestyle-related disease by introducing minimum unit pricing of alcohol in England as well as much tougher legislation to tackle air pollution.Several health organisations highlighted that local councils in England have had to cut their public health budgets in recent years, and will do so again next year, because Hancock’s department of health and social care has reduced their grants to ert more money to frontline NHS services.Jo Bibby, director of health at the Health Foundation thinktank, said its research had found that £700m had been cut from public health grants since 2014-15."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cab9cff4ee7b7b4400779a5d44c24142bc1b23e/0_0_1931_1159/master/1931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec099437a21cf5b16e5d1892cce8a8a7","title":"two in five people with learning disabilities not diagnosed in childhood","story":"Institute of Health Equity director says society is ‘failing to be fair and supportive’Two out of five people with learning disabilities are not diagnosed in childhood and, even if they are, they will likely die before they collect their pension, according to a study commissioned by the NHS.Researchers from the UCL Institute of Health Equity (IHE) found that people with learning disabilities will die 15 to 20 years sooner on average than the general population. That amounts to 1,200 people each year, a figure which chimes with the government’s own estimate. The IHE says it is not a consequence of the underlying condition that led to the learning disability but because they are being “catastrophically” failed by the government.Prof Michael Marmot, IHE director, said: “This is a direct result of a political choice that destines this vulnerable group to experience some of the worst of what society has to offer: low incomes, no work, poor housing, social isolation and loneliness, bullying and abuse.The health equality thinktank cites statistics that show children with learning disabilities are at increased risk of mental health conditions, including depression, with half of the increased risk of mental health difficulties attributable to poverty, poor housing, discrimination and bullying.The IHE says it sounded the alarm bell a year ago that government policy was not working, having documented a slowing down in life expectancy, and called for research into a potential link with austerity, but action has not been taken.A government spokeswoman said: “We recognise the need to tackle the unacceptable inequalities faced by people with learning disabilities and autism.“Improving the lives of people with learning disabilities will be a key part of the NHS long-term plan and we will be consulting shortly on mandatory awareness training for health and care staff to help end unacceptable differences in life expectancy.“Funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities is the highest on record and we are working with employers to support more people with learning disabilities into work.”A spokeswoman for NHS England said the report was commissioned “precisely to draw attention to the wide range of factors which need tackling if, as a society, we are to give everyone with a learning disability the opportunity to lead a long and fulfilling life”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c0b6864b375cbaac3cd427ebaeda1f86d40024/0_242_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5902f052e76c2194b5760ccfec98b942","title":"uk living wage rises above inflation rate for 180000 workers","story":"Voluntary earnings rate to increase to £9 across country and £10.55 in LondonMore than 180,000 workers are set for an inflation-beating pay rise, as the UK living wage rises against a backdrop of increases in transport costs, private rent and council tax.Set by the Living Wage Foundation, the rate is calculated by assessing what workers need to meet the basic cost of living in Britain, and is £1.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25.The foundation encourages employers to introduce the new rates immediately, but UK Living Wage companies will be given until May next year to bring in the pay rises. The national living wage (the title chosen by the former chancellor George Osborne) is the statutory national minimum wage but for those over the age of 25. . It is set at £7.83 an hour it will rise to £8.21 an hour from next April.For 21-24-year-olds, the current rate is £7.38 and will rise to £7.70 and the rate for 18-20-year-olds rises from £5.90 to £6.15.The increase in the UK living wage comes as British households face increasing pressure from higher living costs. Inflation rose sharply following the EU referendum in 2016 when the sudden fall in the value of the pound drove up the cost of importing goods to Britain.Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said more companies still needed to pay higher wages to help workers struggling with the rising cost of living in Britain. “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills,” she said.More than 1,200 organisations have signed up to pay the higher living wage in the past year, including Liverpool FC, the University of Bristol, the combined authority for the city region of Sheffield, and Aberystwyth University.These companies and public sector organisations are however the exception rather than the norm. More than a fifth of jobs pay less than the UK living wage, according to a study from the accountancy firm KPMG.Jobs paying below the UK living wage have also increased by about 1.2m since 2012, with part-time workers and people aged between 18 and 21 most likely to be below the threshold.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said that millions of people were struggling to make ends meet. “These new rates would make a big difference to Britain’s lowest paid workers. But more companies need to sign up,” she said.Growing numbers of employers may find they need to raise their wages to attract staff amid growing numbers of job vacancies, particularly in sectors such as retail, hospitality, agriculture and distribution, as fewer EU migrants choose to come to Britain following the Brexit vote.Amazon recently announced an inflation-beating pay rise for its UK workers, though it did not sign up to the commitments set by the Living Wage Foundation. Questions still also remain over working conditions at the online retailer.James Watt, founder of the raft beer company Brewdog, a Living Wage employer, said it made business sense to pay the living wage, adding that “it’s a shame that short-term mentalities and greed are still prevalent in many industries”. He added: “Far too many companies in the hospitality industry view their employees as transient and disposable and this is why wages are often low, turnover is high and dissatisfaction is the norm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce4ed2bd4292602c6af964d0350a6502fc8f95c/0_14_3781_2268/master/3781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ee814ea098170ece598063029df3e2","title":"england new zealand rugby league international match report","story":"It was nothing more than a soundbite last week, but Wayne Bennett’s declaration that this new-look, younger England side – without so many household names due to injury – deserved to be cherished by the entire country could not be more accurate.With the series now secured following the late victory achieved here by Tommy Makinson completing an outstanding hat-trick, there is now an opportunity to make an emphatic statement in Leeds next Sunday with a clean sweep. Beyond that, though, the challenge is now clear for those in charge of shaping league’s future.There is much to marvel about in this burgeoning national side but the headline act here was St Helens’ Makinson. The winger was making only his third Test appearance but marked the occasion with three magnificent tries, including the winner six minutes from time.The Kiwis once again played their part in an enthralling Test. They had led through Dallin Watene-Zelezniak’s early try and, while Makinson’s first after a superb team move had levelled matters by half-time, New Zealand again moved ahead, this time when Ken Maumalo finished a searing Watene-Zelezniak break. Shaun Johnson converted and kicked a penalty to make it 14-6.“What Wayne is doing with this group is special,” was Makinson’s post-match verdict. Pre-Bennett, an eight-point deficit going into the final quarter would have spelled danger. Not for this squad, though.The hulking twins Tom and George Burgess – younger siblings of injured captain Sam – led the comeback. Scintillating ball-handling from Jonny Lomax and Jake Connor led to Makinson’s second, before Tom Burgess came desperately close to levelling the scores, the prop eventually held up by desperate New Zealand defence.However, two minutes later Connor made it 14-14 in a rare England breakthrough without Makinson – but the winger would have the decisive say. With England pressing, and only one side looking likely to score, Makinson gathered a stray pass, surged infield and elicited a roar from those inside Anfield that sounded like there was a sellout crowd here to witness it.It was 24 years ago that a group of independent consultants drew up a blueprint for British rugby league’s long-term future. Dubbed “Framing the Future”, it was a comprehensive and damning outlook on how the sport spent too much time chasing narrow geographical markets and failed to prioritise what really mattered.You could argue league never truly heeded the stark warnings in that report. But over two decades on, and with the game not fulfilling the potential many believe it has, we have now officially arrived at Framing the Future 2.0, the refresh button the sport has been crying out for. League’s administrators have spent years scouting for the panacea when it comes to domestic structure, but those who are paid extraordinary amounts to decide the game’s future surely now know how and where rugby league in this country blossoms.For all the merits of a strong domestic game, other sports – including, cover your ears league lovers, rugby union – have proven that it is at international level where you truly capture the imagination of the public.How could you not have been captivated here by the latest instalment of what is becoming an unforgettable Test series.For the neutrals, England versus New Zealand is becoming must-see sporting theatre, exposed beautifully on terrestrial television. Yet for England themselves it is clear that this is a group who deserve a much, much greater platform than it currently occupies.To build on the success of this autumn, and to get new eyes and ears on the game, the focus must be on England playing as often as possible – preferably on home soil, too. With due respect to the domestic game, Widnes versus Wakefield will not amplify league’s profile: a vibrant international game will.How appropriate, therefore, that the RLIF meet this week to map out international rugby’s long-term future. Bennett, a staunch internationalist, knows what must happen.“Get the politics out of the way, the players want to play,” he said after the thrilling victory here.“I hope people stand up for the game and give us all what we want: international rugby played between the best players.”Bennett’s appointment ruffled feathers in 2016 but he has overseen a remarkable transformation of the national side. If international rugby is properly prioritised in the years to come maybe it can dream of selling out arenas like Anfield. As for England, who knows where the future could take a group that appear to have the world at their feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d116ec049d8e84d3b09a8275b6778644419324a/0_117_5028_3018/master/5028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae612b41f2d7f453a694dfd8e770fb58","title":"england sri lanka first test moeen ali joe root","story":"Pitch and weather have not helped Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss make up their minds for Tuesday’s first Test at GalleLet us begin with the certainties. Jonny Bairstow is unavailable for selection for the Galle Test match on fitness grounds. Er, that’s it.Both Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss were singing from the same hymn sheet on Sunday but there was very little on it. We cannot be sure who is going to bat at No 3 for England on Tuesday the balance of the side has yet to be finalised and we don’t even know who is going to keep wicket.They are not being deliberately obstructive. That has not been their way in recent times. In England they have usually been more than happy to name their side days before the start of a match since it can help the players to know what is going on as soon as possible. But here there are too many imponderables – about the pitch and the weather – and they need to do some more talking among themselves.It is bizarre that they have not decided upon their wicketkeeper, yet understandable. Much hinges upon the No 3 slot in the team. A week ago that position seemed destined for Joe Denly. This now seems less likely though this conclusion is reached via the odd nuance here, a change of emphasis there. It’s all good fun unless you are craving early clarity.Bayliss said: “Mo certainly could bat at three.” Root talked about the yearning to be bold and adventurous, which might involve changing the batting order during a game. One concern about Moeen Ali batting at No 3 – and there may be several – is that he may have just come off the field having bowled 40 overs.If Moeen is earmarked for No 3 then the prospect of a debut for Ben Foakes, whose batting could be as productive as anyone else on the edge of the Test team, is real, especially since the perception remains that he may be the most gifted keeper here.Or there is the possibility of playing yet another all-rounder, Chris Woakes, who is probably too polite to point out that he hit a century in the last Test match played at Lord’s. However the likelihood of the phoneticist’s dream of Stokes, Foakes and Woakes in the same team remains small.Unless it rains so much that the duration of the game is severely limited, then the anticipation is that England will play three spinners. Asked if this was a viable option, Bayliss replied: “Very much so here in Galle. But that might be different at one or two of the other grounds.” The three-spinner option does not entirely rule out Stuart Broad but it would reduce his chances of playing.Root addressed the possibility of omitting Broad, who has just about been a fixture in the side for a decade. “It is always hard to leave out someone who has taken over 430 wickets. The great position we are in is that Stuart has practised really well his action looks really strong and he is bowling with good pace. He looks right on top of his game so you can’t ask for more from a player.”Whatever the permutations, Root knows his team is overdue a win away from home and that historically Galle is not the likeliest venue to achieve this. England have not won a match overseas since squeaking home against Bangladesh in Chittagong over two years ago. However he remains refreshingly positive about this tour, despite all the impediments.He draws a contrast with last winter’s Ashes expedition: “It just proves how brilliant Test cricket is that you can go to two very different parts of the world and play two different styles of cricket which are both entertaining and great fun to be involved in while offering completely different challenges.” Even so it will be a relief to him and just about everyone else when the selection riddle is solved and we can focus on what is happening out in the middle – thunderstorms permitting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ae409b79b39d51e4f02ecfd36e5e42515f96d5/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e51f23cb908222831bcce52f0e9ef5","title":"gymnast oksana chusovitina saga brings tear to eye","story":"The gymnast, still competing at the world championships at the age of 43, once vaulted for her son’s life. Her longevity has paved the way for other mothers to remain in the sportI don’t care who knows it: gymnastics makes me cry. In a good way, I should add, not in an “is this the only sport BBC still has rights to?” way. It doesn’t matter if it’s Gabby Douglas becoming the first black gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title, or Epke Zonderland falling from the high bar and landing flat on his nose. There is something about the sheer ambition of gymnastics – coupled with the generous camaraderie that makes rivals look like the best of friends – that’s more tearjerking than an entire afternoon of Hallmark Christmas movies.This year’s world championships were always going to be emotional. And while Simone Biles’s record-breaking return to competition gave my lip a dangerous quiver, it was one of her competitors in the vault final that broke the dam. Her name was Oksana Chusovitina, and I last saw her perform two years ago at the Olympic Games in Rio. Back then, we held our breath as she prepared to execute the Produnova, the so-called vault of death – a highly dangerous routine even Biles herself had balked at because, she said “I’m not trying to die”.Chusovitina hadn’t managed to pull off the vault, or finish on the podium and her routine had changed in the two years since. In Doha she stood at the end of the runway, long hair pulled back and slicked down, her face devoid of the glittery eye-make up that many of the younger gymnasts favoured.Hers was the last vault of the final. Biles and Shallon Olsen, in first and second place respectively, shouted encouragement: “C’mon Oksana, you got this!” Alexo Moreno, in third place, couldn’t take her eyes off the floor. Chusovitina had been ill during the build-up to competition, but Moreno knew what a threat the woman with a record nine world championship medals on this apparatus posed.Chusovitina licked her palms, and sprinted at the springboard like Tom Cruise at a helicopter. Only a backward step on landing betrayed her she finished in fourth. Not bad for a 43-year-old.Chusovitina herself can be dismissive of the age gap between her and her rivals. “Perhaps it’s some sort of a sensation,” she says, “but I don’t think it is.” It’s hard for her to appreciate that to other 40-somethings – the ones taking up Pilates to fend off hereditary back trouble – her physical capabilities are as superhuman as anything Zack Snyder could imagine.My favourite quote about this Martina Navratilova of gymnastics comes from the 2008 beam champion from the Beijing Games, Shawn Johnson. “No one even knows how old she is anymore, because it seems like she’s been to the last gazillion Olympics.” Well, sure, Shawn, “seven” doesn’t have the same ring to it. But it’s still a record. More than a quarter of century in a sport that usually consigns its heroes to toothpaste endorsements and TV cameos in half that time.To me, the real power of Chusovitina’s story is not in the statistics – the fact that Biles wasn’t born when she started competing internationally, or that she has a son older than some of her teammates. It’s in the hand she was dealt and the choices she made. And it’s a particularly timely reminder that none of us choose where we are born.Chusovitina is from Uzbekistan her first international forays were under the flag of the Soviet Union. After its break-up she returned to her home country to train – in terrible conditions, on substandard equipment – and still won medals. And in 2002, when Chusovitina was on the verge of retiring, her three-year-old son Alisher was diagnosed with leukaemia.With no medical facilities in her home country capable of saving Alisher’s life, and no health insurance, Chusovitina moved to Germany, where the gymnastics community helped raise funds for his treatment. Chusovitina kept training because the prize money was a vital source of income. “If I don’t compete then my son won’t live, it’s as simple as that,” she said.The story has several happy endings. Alisher was cured and his mother found out a few days after she won her first inidual Olympic medal, in Beijing, at the age of 33. Chusovitina did eventually retire, after London 2012, and it lasted less than 12 hours. She woke up next morning and changed her mind.Last year she was the first gymnast ever inducted into her sport’s hall of fame while still active. “I feel like every year that I’m competing I’m leaving a little part of myself behind,” she said at the time. She was right. In Doha last week, four of the gymnasts competing were mothers Chusovitina had been an inspiration to them all.“Oksana is a wonderful person,” said Aliya Mustafina. “By looking at her, I understood it was possible to come back.” Sure, not every athlete has the capacity or the drive to stick at their sport as long as Chusovitina, but her longevity is already creating a legacy. And her unshowy breaking of boundaries is as worthy of celebration as any medal she missed out on in Doha.Chusovitina said she was proud to know that she had set an example. She also said that her pre-tournament sickness notwithstanding, she could see now that she was perfectly on course in her preparations to qualify for the 2020 Olympics. “I could compete with all the girls with no problems at all,” she said. “I know and I am sure that I have a goal now.” What a goal it is. If she makes it to the vault final in Tokyo, I’m going to buy shares in Kleenex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8283f296626af398b88af21c9a75ca0ca47efe2/0_218_4268_2560/master/4268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a7e14c6cb556516d129075dbd438ba","title":"the exorcism review battersea arts centre london ross sutherland","story":"Battersea Arts Centre, LondonShifting between eerie ghost story and broad comedy, Ross Sutherland’s intriguing solo show about demonic possession never quite makes its intentions clearJust as there’s no consensus on what leads to cases of demonic possession (mental illness, an over-fertile imagination, or the devil’s work?), so, too, Ross Sutherland’s solo show could be one of several things. Is it a comedy, a piss-take – or heartfelt spine-tingler? It’ll certainly make you jump, as lights flickers, wild squawks puncture the silence, and Sutherland’s Father David Smith tries to drive evil out of a traumatised family home.But this is no straightforward bone-chiller. The dramatic register switches as unpredictably as the temperature in Sutherland’s haunted house, as deadpan ghost story becomes broad comedy becomes knowing on-stage cultural critique. I only ever had a fleeting sense of what Sutherland was getting at, but it’s got something to do with the theory advanced by Father David’s exorcism guru, that demonic possession is a form of conceptual art.And so the show unfolds as a battle between a disembodied artist, forever embroiling its victims in new conceptual and narrative worlds, and a priest-cum-critic, dispelling them with – well, a pop song, as it happens. Presumably that’s the exorcism equivalent of a one-star review. Sutherland by turns narrates and acts out Father David’s gruelling journey, which messes with his (and our) head. Is he an apprentice exorcist at all, or is this a fever dream in which he must slay the demons of a lifetime of guilt and mediocrity? I couldn’t answer that question with any certainty, but I can promise that Sutherland’s show – in Rob Watt’s taut production – makes for intriguing, distinctive viewing. When he needs to, Sutherland gets just right the slightly numbed cadences and thousand-yard stare of the survivor of spiritual assault. Real tension is stoked at what might be round the next corner – even if that’s another comic set piece, as the artistdemon starts dredging the bottom of the creative barrel.The meaning of it all is elusive, which is partly the point, I suspect, of an enterprise that’s cynical about trite narrative closure. It’s a show that pulls the rug out from under you so many times you begin to doubt there’s anything solid underfoot whatsoever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bf88358ef51f073e739a7adf8cd97cbbdb305f/0_277_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f3852fff3de57b8404f64f4e59fe0f","title":"pret a porter marliyn stafford 1960 paris montmartre","story":"In 1950s Paris, photographer Marilyn Stafford was commissioned to capture the glamour and elegance of a new fashion concept – prêt-à-porter.She took models out of the studios and into the gritty working-class areas of the French capital, where they attracted the attention of curious children playing in the streets.The result was a collection of black-and-white photographs showcasing the likes of Chanel and Givenchy that reflect both the style and the darker, dirtier side of the City of Light.In this shot, a pouting child in a well-worn dress and scuffed boots sits perched on railings on the Montmartre steps, in stark contrast to the designer-clad model who is gesturing theatrically.“I loved the streets. I wasn’t so interested in the clothes – I was looking for interesting places, backgrounds, passageways and alleys,” Stafford says.“And in those days if you were a woman out in Paris with a camera, you had kids following you.”Stafford, who was born in Ohio in 1925, initially worked as a singer after arriving in postwar Paris, performing at a club near the Champs Élysées, where she met Edith Piaf, Charles Aznavour and Bing Crosby, as well as the French photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa.After her voice failed, she took the Rolleiflex camera she used for “casual snaps” and sought advice from Cartier-Bresson – who let Stafford watch him while he worked – and Capa, who suggested that she join him in documenting the war in Indochina (where he was later killed).Shunning the battlefields, Stafford, who turns 93 tomorrow, went on to report from around the world, including for the Observer.Today, Stafford admits there was another reason for using the street as a fashion backdrop: “I had no studio.

Love Without Limits (BBC Two), the first episode of Louis Theroux’s new documentary miniseries, Altered States, took him to Portland, Oregon, the epicentre of polyamory, or ethical non-monogamy, as it is now called. It is centred on the facility of “compersion” – taking pleasure in seeing your significant other(s) happy in whatever way it takes. If you’re exhausted already, I’d advise you not to read on.Theroux gently interrogates three poly groups. Joelle, Mattias and AJ live and love together on an eco-homestead (I told you not to read on) and have other partners, too. Or in Joelle’s case: “‘Sweeties’ ... I tend not to use hierarchical terms in my polydynamics.” AJ is pregnant by Mattias and takes on another “metamor” (another non-hierarchical term used by the poly community) during filming. Mattias is surprised to find this testing his compersion capacity.Then there are Bob, Nick and Amanda, who live as a “thruple”. The latter pair were college sweethearts, but when Amanda developed feelings for Bob, she proposed inviting him into their relationship rather than breaking up. Nick – after a year of discussion – agreed. He remains monogamous with Amanda. They used to have threesomes because “we thought we had to”, but that didn’t work because “Bob lasts a really long time in bed and I don’t. So I’d have to go first or I’d fall asleep. Or go down and play video games or,” he added with a grin, “have lunch. But I’m better at foreplay, I enjoy it more.” Now they take it in turns. It seems to be working quite well. Not least, one suspects, for Amanda. “Is there a part of you that wishes you were enough for Amanda in the same way as she is enough for you?” Theroux asks the men in his patented tone of careful interest. “A little part of me wishes I could make her completely happy,” says Bob. At least one little part is working as hard as it can at that already.And then there is the married couple Heidi and Jerry her lover, Joe and his wife, Gretchen. To the casual observer, Heidi and Joe seemed to be stretching the definition of ethical non-monogamy. Gretchen said she was happy that Heidi was having the sex with Joe that she had lost all interest in having while they worked on other problems in their marriage. Jerry had a thousand-yard stare and a very soft voice while he insisted that everything was fine, after his period of “adjustment” when first an old friend of Heidi’s and then Joe inserted themselves into his marriage. “It was hurtful,” he remembers with a dreadful smile. “And anxiety-producing.” He has not yet found a partner. “But when I do it will be awesome.”Theroux presses both women on Jerry’s – self-evident, to Theroux and us – loneliness. Echoing other polys he has interviewed, they are both very clear. “I am not responsible for Jerry’s happiness,” says Heidi. “You are responsible for your own happiness,” says Gretchen. Jerry suggests he could join Heidi and Joe one night. Or at least watch. Heidi’s face tells you all you need to know about who their setup is benefiting. She slams the lid down hard on the idea. Compersion is a one-way street, apparently.Theroux, as ever, treads his tightrope without a wobble (unless you count the unnecessary stunt of sending him to a borderline-orgy, even if it did provide a little light relief). He asks just enough and just hard-enough questions to challenge his interviewees and force them (and us) to think, without alienating them, and hangs back enough to let the answers’ openness or person’s defensiveness, body language, pauses and silences say at least as much again. By the end, the issue is complicated rather than simplified and your own questions fill your head as the credits roll.Is polyamory a new way of dealing with ancient problems or just a new way of trying to avoid them? Is infidelity immoral, or only when it produces the look Jerry has on his face between determined smiles? What if it always, always does, somewhere along the line? Are we hardwired to betray or feel betrayed, or are these only constructs? If we’re not hardwired then why did we construct them in the first place? Is being responsible only for your own happiness a better basis on which to build a relationship or a society, or selfishness of the highest order that will sew the seeds of its own destruction? Are the polyamorous denying their essential humanity, indulging it or evolving beyond it?Answers on a postcard please. I am truly exhausted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37ccfc058096761e9f8861cff65b8b7d7fa5292/0_33_4300_2579/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=168b2221c9ec486152f87663a1d89e74","title":"the little drummer girl recap episode two the cast assemble the plot thickens","story":"Charlie is drawn in to Kurtz’s team as she and Becker work together to play their roles in foiling the bombers. But who is fooling who?SPOILER ALERT: This recap contains spoilers for episode two of The Little Drummer Girl. You can read the episode one recap here.Peter. Joseph. And now Becker. In a very short time, Alexander Skarsgård’s broad-shouldered but brooding agent has already picked up multiple aliases. As the stubbled yet slippery operative told his newest asset that her mission was to drive a dodgy red Mercedes stuffed with Russian plastic explosive across multiple borders, a pertinent question might seem to be: would you buy a used Le Carré from this man?That was where episode two of The Little Drummer Girl pulled on the handbrake for another week, with Florence Pugh’s pugnacious Charlie – so recently living out a moonlit romantic fantasy in front of the Parthenon – left weighing up her options against the backdrop of a very different kind of Greek ruin: a remote, rusty industrial mill. It looked like the sort of place you could safely discuss such covert business (or dump an uncooperative body, perhaps).The journey to get there was a rocky one, a twinned tale of non-voluntary auditions. Having been delivered to a Love Island-esque Athens villa (ocean views, lovely pool, discreet sliding doors), Charlie was apparently bullied into spilling all her shameful family secrets. Under the severe but self-amused gaze of plotter-in-chief Kurtz and his cadre of agents she opened up about fending for herself since she was 15. It involved a banged-up dad, booze and some unpleasant business with bailiffs. “They took it all: my childhood, my home, my happiness,” she said, gulping back tears. It all seemed like a plausible seed for her firebrand politics.Unfortunately, the fastidious snoopers of Mossad had only been doling out rope so Charlie could trip herself up. Her biographical claims were dismantled in front of her by a series of cold, barked facts: she came from a loving family and had workshopped that hardscrabble origin to add a tang of tragedy to her backstory, the sort of thing that casting agents and even fellow actors might devour. The glum Becker – to her, still prickly semi-amour Joseph – bluntly delivered the last wrecking balls that demolished her constructed personality. Charlie got one solid right hook in but then crumpled into a sobbing heap at her tormentor’s feet. “You did great, kid,” chirruped Kurtz. “You got the part!”Charlie, at least, got the chance to take the lead in her performance. “Michel”, AKA Salim, the playboy bomber relieved of his liberty and flashy red Merc last week, had no such agency. Renditioned to Kurtz’s safehouse in the Munich Olympic Village – a complex of brutalist apartments that, as some commentators noted, looked suspiciously like London’s Alexandra and Ainsworth estate – Salim was confined in a sturdy fake cell with concealed speakers piping in the muffled cries of prison life. This was the sort of thing they used to do on the vintage Mission: Impossible TV show, mounting an elaborate panto to disorientate a target.In the end, it took some heavily spiked orange segments and a campaign of misinformation – including a faked letter from his beloved sister Fatmeh – to squeeze some intel out of Salim. As he was drugged and deceived, there was the incongruous sight of his captors crowding round a map studying his recent movements while they thoughtfully sucked on what looked like Zoom rocket-ship ice lollies, an unsettling suggestion of how at ease these operatives were in their murky work. (In the end, it took some cruel questioning from Kurtz’s eager junior agent Shimon to get Salim to give up the vital info: that he was supposed to deliver a Merc-load of semtex to Salzburg station in Austria.)While Salim was unravelling, Charlie was being refashioned into an asset. To infiltrate Salim’s cell, she was required to build up a convincing cover as one of Michel’s girlfriends, plausible enough to convince his comrades-in-arms. Coached by Becker – constantly in character as “Michel”, even wearing Salim’s wide-collared red shirt from happier days in Munich – this involved refashioning her recent past and discussing their imagined sex life over grapes and neat vodka. For Charlie, this represents the personal and professional challenge of a 360-degree performance of constant improvisation (“There will be no cut, no curtain,” warns Kurtz), even if she mostly seems in it to try and decipher Becker and the secrets of his constantly furrowed brow. Or is it simply the thrill of the secret agent life that makes her agree so readily to something so demonstrably risky?When the central thread of your drama is about characters and their ability to convincingly play different parts, performances will obviously come under scrutiny. Some commentators were not entirely convinced by Michael Shannon’s dishevelled but crafty spymaster, but there was a moment here, when he was selecting which pair of glasses to wear before interrogating Charlie, that suggests Kurtz is perhaps the biggest actor of them all, and perhaps the only one truly enjoying all these false faces. “I’ve been kidnapped by an experimental theatre company,” muttered Charlie darkly. It may well turn out to be the truth.The Little Drummer Girl still looks lavish but with the odd queasy lurch. In the opening scenes, director Park Chan-wook played out a flashback at a Solidarity Against Imperialism forum in Dorset – where a masked MichelSalim explained the roots of his militancy to an audience including Charlie – before rewinding the action on-screen along with the audio surveillance tape. These little unnerving moments of unexpected camera movement help maintain an undercurrent of unease, although Park seems equally interested in Charlie’s gorgeous, vivid summer wardrobe. After last week’s yellow La La Land number, tonight’s highlight was a gorgeous deep-blue hooded dress with more than a hint of Scottish Widows about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66cfa3513b141743cec1467b8b59e126f7788c17/0_188_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cf6c8e32e214593bccb6c38c0f4d684","title":"mondays best tv doing money brexit what the nation really thinks","story":"Based on a true story, this feature-length one-off drama follows a young Romanian woman, Ana, who is snatched from a London street and sex-trafficked by a gang running brothels in Ireland.

He unleashed on the Democrat candidate Stacey Abrams from Georgia, who is vying to become the country’s first female black governor: “Stacey Abrams wants to turn your wonderful state into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, putting innocent Georgia families at the mercy of hardened criminals and predators,” Trump said.In Indiana, Obama laid out a picture of politics led by a man who had no qualms about lying or about playing to people’s fears. “What kind of politics do we want,” he asked. “What we have not seen at least in my memory is where, right now, you’ve got politicians blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying. Just making up stuff.” He ridiculed Trump’s focus in the final days of the campaign on the caravan of Central American asylum seekers: “Two weeks before the election they are telling us that the single greatest threat to America is a bunch of poor, impoverished, broken, hungry refugees 1,000 miles away.”You can see the key midterm races, when to expect results and how to follow the poll here.Irish border ‘50-50’ – EU officials say the chance of Theresa May striking a deal on the Irish border that she can sell to her cabinet is “50-50” as talks enter their final stage. British and European negotiating teams begin a secretive phase known as the “tunnel” this week, with senior EU figures warning of “incompatible” key areas. The discussions come as more than 1,500 of the UK’s top lawyers, including Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC and former court of appeal judge Konrad Schiemann, urged the PM and MPs to back a second Brexit referendum, saying that “democratic government is not frozen in time”. In a letter to May, they said parliament should not be bound by the 2016 vote any more than it should be by the 1975 referendum that took Britain into the EU, especially when there were question marks over its validity.Obesity air pollution link – Pollution from cars and trucks increases the risk of children becoming obese, a new study has found. High levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is emitted by diesel engines, in the first year of life leads to significantly faster weight gain later. “We would urge parents to be mindful where their young children spend their time, especially considering if those areas are near major roads,” said Jeniffer Kim, at the University of Southern California, who led the new research. You can read about why air pollution around the world is on the rise here, and the worst city’s affected (half the the top 20 most polluted are in India).Tower tribute – Ten thousand torches lit up the surrounds of the Tower of London on Sunday night in a tribute to fallen servicemen ahead of this year’s 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. “I think it creates the right atmosphere for people to have their own personal reflections, and gives people time with their own thoughts,” said Royal Navy midshipman, Balraj Dhanda. The torch ceremony, called Beyond the Deepening Shadow, will be repeated every night until Remembrance Sunday on 11 November.As Brexit negotiations gear up again this week, the campaign for a second referendum is gathering momentum. But who are the people trying to stop Brexit? We hear from James McGrory, the director of the People’s Vote campaign.

A handful businesses are adopting a shorter working week, which is being touted by some as the answer to the UK’s “productivity problem”. British people work some of the longest hours in Europe: the average worker takes only a 34-minute lunch break and works 10 hours overtime each week (more often than not, this is unpaid). Yet UK productivity lags seriously behind our European neighbours, who tend to work fewer hours. France recently made it illegal to expect workers to answer emails out of hours, and the average French worker produces more by the end of Thursday than their UK counterparts do in a full week.England’s second-half revival in the weekend’s narrow win over South Africa has left Eddie Jones eager for his side to prove themselves against the best team in the world, the All Blacks.There is little certainty about England’s lineup for Tuesday’s first Test against Sri Lanka, with the pitch in Galle and the weather not helping Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss make up their minds on team selection.Manchester City’s 6-1 dismantling of Southampton on Sunday illustrated just how difficult it will be to dethrone Pep Guardiola’s side, while two goals from Álvaro Morata and a third from Pedro took Chelsea to a 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace. James Milner was the man who scored Liverpool’s goal in their 1-1 draw with Arsenal on Saturday and, according to Jürgen Klopp, it was also the midfielder who offered some stern words to fire up his team at half-time.Mary Keitany of Kenya has become the second woman to win the New York Marathon four times, beating countrywoman Vivian Cheruiyot to victory by three minutes.And Tommy Makinson’s outstanding hat-trick carried England to a series win over New Zealand and made clear the challenge for those in charge of shaping rugby league’s future.The ’s main story today is “Chance of May striking Brexit deal is 50-50, say EU officials”. The front page also features a photograph of the torches that were lit on Sunday evening in the moat of the Tower of London, to mark the centenary of the end of the first world war. Pictures of the Tower feature on many of the front pages today, but only the Daily Mail splashes with a story on the subject: “Ablaze with 10,000 torches, haunting tribute that says: We will remember”.Stories about social care and health services feature strongly today. The Times says the NHS is charged millions by substandard providers “Firms cash in on care crisis”, the Daily Mirror reports on a poll they’ve conducted which found “We’ll pay more to care for the elderly” and the Express has the story of a Falklands veteran who went on hunger strike in protest at the lack of mental health services for ex-service people: “Victory for hunger strike hero”.The FT reports on comments from the deputy prime minister of Italy: “Italy’s recipe for growth will work for whole of Europe, says Di Maio” and the Daily  says the armed services are expanding recruitment to foreign nationals who have never lived in the UK: “Forces open door to foreigners who have never lived in Britain”.The Sun has a story about a book deal secured by an ex-cop who worked the Madeleine McCann case: “Cop makes £350k from Maddie”.For more news: www.the Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Clarke’s husband is a New Zealander and she has been a frequent visitor to the country over the last two decades.“I have been travelling to New Zealand for a long time now, over the past few years there has been a massive change in terms of the resurgence of te reo,” she said.“I think New Zealand is becoming increasingly bilingual and I actually think you’re not credible now if you don’t make an effort.”Clarke said learning te reo and engaging with Māoridom around the country was a priority for the high commission in Wellington, and the recruitment drive to find a full-time Maori affairs adviser and part-time language teacher reflected social change.“It is very easy to engage with the crown because the structures are all there and previously we’ve probably engaged in a more ad hoc way with Māoridom and I want to change that,” said Clarke, whose three young children are learning te reo at school.The high commissioner said New Zealand was “serious” about healing its relationship with the indigenous population, which is still disproportionately represented in low social-economic indicators, incarceration rates and poor health and well-being outcomes.“Identity politics are big here and there is a sense of righting past wrongs. There was a generation that were discouraged from speaking te reo and punished and there is a strong sense of needing to put that right,” says Clarke.“There has been a bit of tradition of British people just speaking loudly in English and it is really important not to do that. Making an effort to speak some te reo should be the new normal.”Along with English, te reo is one of New Zealand’s two main languages. It has been undergoing a revival in recent years, with long waiting lists for classes, a shortage of teachers and high-profile media personalities, politicians and stars using the language in their daily repertoire."},{"url":null,"title":"understated halloween japan embraces low key cosplay","story":"Tokyo residents donned unflashy costumes that skewered social dilemmas as antidote to traditional celebrationsWhile thousands donned meticulously assembled costumes and caused mayhem in central Tokyo, other people in Japan opted to mark Halloween in a more reserved fashion.An “Understated Halloween” event was held in the Shibuya district of Tokyo where “flashy fancy dress” was banned in favour of dressing up to recreate everyday scenes and encounters from Japanese life that elicited nods of recognition to shoulder-shaking mirth after photos of the event went viral on social media.The images were widely shared among Twitter users in Japan over the weekend, serving as an antidote to the mass exhibitionism that has come to define traditional Halloween celebrations in the capital’s Shibuya district.The tableaux included the apprentice hairdresser who has cut too much hair off a speechless customer, an actor in his 20s forced to play a high school pupil, and a traveler who, on returning to Tokyo’s Haneda airport from warmer climes, realises he is inadequately dressed.Some targeted the corporate world, including an ad for a hay fever nasal wash, a Uniqlo mannequin and “the kind of model you see on cheap Korean fashion mail order sites”.There was room, too, for takes on celebrity memes, exemplified by “Keanu Reeves eating lunch alone.”One of the Japanese co-organisers of the event, which was held in Shibuya, encouraged people to keep spreading the Understated Halloween message to English speakers.Mulboyne, a Tokyo resident, was among those who had obliged, creating a single thread that attracted dozens of messages from grateful users in Japan and beyond.“I first heard of this event a couple of years ago but only ever saw one or two characters, and didn’t really understand what they were doing. This year, I heard my wife giggling ... that led me to the dailyportalz site. They seemed so clever, and many were a great reflection of the way Japanese people can be keen observers of tics, foibles, and minor social dilemmas,” he said.Not surprisingly for a country with a long tradition of cosplay and an appetite for American culture, Japan has embraced Halloween with an enthusiasm matched in few other countries.While the US tradition of dishing out sweets to trick-or-treating children seems to be confined to police officers and yakuza gangsters, for many young Japanese, wearing a costume – from the macabre to the playful – and comparing their handiwork in bars, clubs, and on the street has become an unmissable annual event.Japan, though, is less prepared for impromptu gatherings of costumed hordes at popular spots like Shibuya’s scramble crossing, where more than a dozen people were arrested last week for groping and theft.One group overturned a small truck, while volunteers spent the early hours of morning cleaning up huge quantities of rubbish left behind by their fellow revellers. For businesses, residents and the police, Halloween Japan-style may be more trouble than it’s worth."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684334.1541183727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"families feel the pinch as cost of living rises to over 50 000 a year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Those who bought a property at the height of the boom might find themselves spending €52,593 a year. Those who bought this year could spend a total of €47,623 over the next 12 months. Photograph: iStockWhen the cost of groceries, mortgage payments, utility bills, motoring, phones, the most modest of social lives, home insurance, car insurance, school and childcare and all the other things that most of us consider essential to live are totted up, a typical family who bought even a small home during the boom years are likely to spend more than €50,000 over the next 12 months.That is an after-tax figure and goes some way towards explaining why two adults earning an average wage still struggle to keep their heads above water despite the fact the economy has recovered in recent years.According to independent figures compiled by this newspaper, coupled with the seventh annual cost-of-living survey published this morning by AA Home Insurance, prices in key areas have climbed over the last 12 months and have largely wiped out any savings that people can expect as a result of tax changes rolled out in last month’s budget.According to the figures from the AA, the annual cost of owning and maintaining a family home now stands at €16,374, an increase of over €350 compared with 2017. And that figure does not include food, entertainment, education, clothes or any of the other things people need to stay alive.The AA carries out a detailed calculation each year which looks at the total cost of owning a house and subsequently running one in Ireland. Mortgage and property tax are calculated based on the current average property price. All other expenditure – from broadband and heating to the cost of domestic appliances – is researched and calculated according to prices as of October 2018.Looking at the figures going back several years suggests Irish consumers have been on a real rollercoaster of costs over the past decade.In 2007, when the average cost of buying a home was €344,000, the annual cost of servicing that home – including mortgage repayments – was €21,344.08. In 2014, with average house prices at €193,0000, the cost of running a home fell to €15,891.67.In 2015, with the average house price nationally at €205,000, the AA put the cost of running a home at €15,156, while in 2016 with average house prices at €215,000, the cost was €15,876.45. Last year, the average house price was €228,000 and the AA yearly figure was €16,006.62.This year it is €16,374.45 as the average property asking price climbed to €243,000.Increases in mortgage repayments and a jump in energy costs are the key drivers behind the €350 per annum increase in the annual cost of owning and maintaining a family home – the third successive year the costs have climbed, the “Cost of Running a Home” analysis suggests.That figure is a key reason why many of us are not feeling any real impact from a sustained economic recovery.The increase in the cost of running a home comes following a rise in the national average price of a second-hand home in Ireland. Values increased from €224,500 during the third quarter of last year to €243,000 in the third quarter of this year.Those who took out a 90 per cent mortgage this year are likely to pay €10,069.08 per annum – an increase of 1.86 per cent on last year.“Another year of rising household costs is the last thing that homeowners would have wanted to hear but it is, unfortunately, the situation that we find ourselves in,” says Conor Faughnan, the AA’s Director of Consumer Affairs.“While the continued climb of house prices has been one of the major stories of 2018, it’s not just the cost of mortgage repayments or getting your foot on the property ladder that have risen in the past 12 months,” he adds.“Home heating and electricity costs have also surged in the past year, meaning that even those who were fortunate enough to acquire their home when property prices were a little lower have seen their wallets take a significant hit.He says “urgent action in terms of the available housing stock is needed” if the issue of rising house prices is to be tackled “but questions also need to be asked of what supports can be made available to those struggling to meet these costs”.While the AA bases its calculations on those of a new buyer, there is also the “negative equity generation” – homeowners who bought their house at the peak of the boom. And the picture painted for this cohort is bleaker still.According to the AA figures, the group who bought a house in 2007 at the very height of the boom, pays €5,605.44 more on their mortgage repayments than their counterparts who purchased their homes in the third quarter of this year.Maintenance, repair and contingency funds is the second single most expensive bill for Irish householders and has increased by 0.7 per cent on 2017. The AA estimates that the average homeowner is likely to spend or set aside €1,255.56 each year to keep up with wear and tear. This figure equates to almost 8 per cent of the overall estimated cost of owning and running a home.Taking annual average usage figures of 11,000 kWh and 4,200 kWh for a three- or four-bedroom detached house respectively, the AA estimates that the average homeowner will spend €785.90 – an increase of 11 per cent – heating their home this year and a further €1,047.33 on electricity – also an increase of 11 per cent.Among the variables that remained the same as or close to last year were television licence costs at €160, property tax at €405, and AA Home Membership at €125.88.Other costs included in the AA Home Insurance study were: home insurance which is calculated at about €566.98, telephone and broadband bills at €434.62, household appliances at €550, household cleaning products at €311.03 and domestic refuse collection at €306.07.Last year the price of home insurance was put at €547.81 while telephone and broadband bills were averaged at €468.66. The cost of household appliances was said to be €573.82 while the cost of household cleaning products was put at at €281.85 and domestic refuse collection, which costs an average of €304.51.The AA figures, while comprehensive, only look at the costs of keeping a roof over your head and don’t factor in fairly important elements such as food, transport and all the other things that most people would struggle to live without.To work out how much a typical family of two adults and two children will need to spend over the next 12 months, we used the standard financial statement that banks ask customers to fill in if they are trying to restructure debts. Among the costs covered are health insurance, transport expenses, food, clothes and grooming, entertainment, childcare, education and mobile phones. So, how are those costs bearing up this year?There is a huge number of plans and a huge number of variables when it comes to health insurance. We compared three broadly similar family-friendly plans. Laya Healthcare’s Essential Connect Family plan will cost two adults and two children €3,081 compared with €3,052 last year. The VHI’s Family Plan Level 1 will cost €2,537, down from €2,805 last year. A Family Focus plan from Irish Life Health, meanwhile, is €3,673 – the same as last year. The average comes out at €3,097, compared with €3,176 in 2017.The average motorist drives 16,000km (9,900 miles) every year and the average price of petrol is €1.44 a litre. Driving the average family car, which does 12.4km per litre (35 miles per gallon), the average Irish driver will spend about €1,857 on petrol compared with €1,755 last year – and €1,664 in 2016.The cost of comprehensive insurance for two adults depends on many factors – notably location, driving history, no-claims bonus and type of car – and although prices have fallen back slightly compared with last year’s highs, our notional family can expect to have little change out of €1,150 this year.The average annual motor tax is €408 per motorist while at least €400 will have to be put aside to cover servicing and maintenance. If you spend €10,000 on a car, keep it for five years and then sell it for half the price you paid for it, the annual cost is €1,000, which takes the total running costs to €4,815 – last year we put that cost at €4,545.There has not been much movement in supermarket prices over the last year – either up or down so if the average Irish household spends €175 a week on groceries, the total bill will come in at €9,100 compared with €8,840 last year, although that doesn’t factor in a Christmas blow-out of any kind.According to the Insolvency Service of Ireland expenditure guidelines, the minimum an adult needs to cover the cost of “social inclusion” is €28.97 a week – and that is to cover the cost of “sports activities and social events such as visits to the cinema”. That seems somewhat mean to us so it we give each adult an extra tenner a week to blow on themselves and an extra €10 to cover each child each week, the annual spend on social inclusion for a family of four will come to €5,092.Education and childcare: €7,745According to the annual school costs survey published by Barnardos in August when the cost of clothes, shoes, books, stationery, classroom resources and the voluntary contribution are totted up, a child going into senior infants will cost €360, while the cost of sending a child into secondary school climbs to €765. If we allow a further €500 to cover costs for trips and extra-curricular activities and assume our notional household has one child in senior infants class and one in first year, then the annual cost of a free education climbs to €1,625 – down slightly on last year’s figure.Schools in Ireland are obliged to open for 183 days a year, so if both parents are working, then after-school childcare costs will have to be added to the bill. Our notional family have found themselves a childminder who charges €170 a week for the school year of 36 weeks, which is a total each year of €6,120. Combining that and the education costs, the total spend rises to €7,745.Assuming the man in our notional household visits the barber eight times a year and his partner visits a hairdressers once every 10 weeks (plus once for a special occasion), the total cost of haircare alone will reach €800. If the family then spends just €50 a month on clothes, the amount needed rises to €1,400.When you put it all together, that means the average person who bought a home at the average price in 2018 could easily spend a total of €47,623 over the next 12 months. Those who bought a property at the height of the boom might find themselves spending €52,593. And that is without taking any holidays or factoring in Christmas, birthdays or anything that could be classified as a significant treat over the course of a year.Given that there aren’t very many households where the combined pre-tax income tops €100,000, is it any wonder so many people are still feeling the pinch?"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"HSE has offered new talks with INMO in an attempt to avert industrial actionWomen more likely to receive higher compensation than men in damages for whiplashDrugs worth \u0026euro135,000 discovered in rented house in Bishopstown area of the cityThe building could go to market early next year, says Dublin City CouncilDesign changes \u0026lsquoplaced responsibility on designers\u0026rsquo to certify work under new rulesGuarantee\u0026rsquos specific application to NI may be replaced by Britain-wide customs controlLeft-leaning bloc may serve Labour as bargaining chip in future government formationCollapse of builders Sammon behind 15 of the stalled construction projectsData shows rise in number of deportations from Ireland to Pakistan but fall in numbers sent back to ChinaPayment of \u0026euro240 per week available to fathers on paternity leaveDraft audit highlights flaws in controlling factories and mackerel and herring fleetFunds had been earmarked for the provision of additional hospital bedsCitizens express fears around Brexit, lack of government at Stormont and denial of rightsMater hospital unit to meet growing demand as the number of suspected cases increasesCommission will inquire into former sports coach Bill Kenneally\u0026rsquos abuse of teenage boysIndependence of Polish judiciary in dispute in case of man challenging extraditionPresident calls for a \u0026lsquovalue-based politics\u0026rsquo during event following his re-electionTaoiseach intervenes as Tony O\u0026rsquoBrien compares Minister to \u0026lsquoa frightened little boy\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686238.1541370938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit backstop deal set to cover all of uk","story":"October 31st, 2018: Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney says a deal on Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the European Union is possible by November 21st, but it will require British negotiators in particular to step up efforts. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder at Derry: emerging withdrawal agreement will contain additional measures on the Border,  including extra customs rules. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe final deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union is set to include a backstop that will apply to the entire United Kingdom, but will have additional measures for Northern Ireland to ensure there is no hard border.The  understands a common view is emerging in Dublin, London and Brussels on the contentious issue.A Northern Ireland-specific backstop – a guarantee to avoid a hard border even if future trade talks fail – would effectively give way to one that would apply across the entirety of Britain for customs only. However, the withdrawal agreement would also contain additional measures that would apply on the Irish Border. These are understood to include some extra customs rules as well as rules to ensure the North’s regulations remain in alignment with EU standards.A senior government source said such “add-ons” do not “change the fact that Northern Ireland remains in the customs territory of the UK”. “You have one backstop – the main element of which is a UK-wide customs union – to be extended with additional measures for Northern Ireland,” the source added.It had been previously mooted that there would be effectively two backstops – one for Northern Ireland and one for the UK – but government figures say this is now unlikely. Sources in Dublin and Brussels are still cautious about the prospect of a European Council summit being convened later this month to sign off on the Brexit withdrawal agreement. British prime minister Theresa May is expected to brief her cabinet on Tuesday, with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, updating ambassadors of the EU27 on Wednesday.Although there is some scepticism that a legally tight customs arrangement between the EU and the UK can be finalised in a short time, Dublin believes it is possible with “political will”. It was also disclosed that the key stumbling block to a deal is now when the provisions of the backstop will end. Agreements already reached between the EU and UK say it will remain “unless and until” another solution to avoid a hard border is found, either by way of a future trade deal or by technological solutions. The UK formally leaves the EU next March and will enter a transition phase which will see it stay in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020. If a future trade deal has not been concluded at that stage, the backstop will then kick in.It is understood the UK has been pushing for a set time when the backstop will cease to apply but Dublin and Brussels are firm that “unless and until” must remain. “That is not resolved yet,” said one well-placed source. “It will only be resolved when they accept a formula of ‘unless and until’. It is not a backstop if it expires.” Periodic assessments of the talks on the EU-UK future trade deal may be made, and the UK may also have the chance to extend the transition period before it ends in 2020. It is now accepted that regulatory checks on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland can be done at factories and shops rather than at Border crossings, a development of Mr Barnier’s “de-dramatisation” initiative.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Youtubelabour\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Brendan Howlin: may not have to vastly improve party’s  Dáil standing to acquire again the position of post-election powerbroker.  Photograph:  Brian LawlessPABrendan Howlin’s request to Labour supporters to continue their preferences to others on the centre left in coming elections serves two purposes.In the first instance, it is aimed at helping candidates in the dozen or so Dáil constituencies where Labour hopes to win seats at the next election.Against stagnant opinion poll ratings, that seems a tough ask. Party figures, however, consistently argue that Labour’s battles will not be fought nationally but on a seat-by-seat basis.In trying to build an alliance of the centre left – including the Green Party, the Social Democrats and “progressive Independents” – Howlin is seeking to ensure Labour is more transfer-friendly in constituencies where it is targeting Dáil seats.An obvious example is Dublin Central, which is increasing from a three- to a four-seater at the next election. Joe Costello, the old Labour warhorse, is running to regain the seat he lost in 2016. One of his rivals is Gary Gannon, seen as a star of the Social Democrats.Labour is quietly confident that Costello can win a seat, and that transfers from Gannon could see him through.Although Howlin’s appeal was a unilateral offer and not a move towards a formal pact, he was almost immediately rebuffed by Róisín Shortall, the co-leader of the Social Democrats.Some of the enmity between Shortall and her former colleagues in Labour lingers still, but Howlin and Eamon Ryan have co-operated on a number of issues in this Dáil. The Green Party leader is likely to be more agreeable to a transfer agreement than Shortall.Ryan may also be open to using an alliance of the left as a bargaining chip in post-election government formation talks, which is likely the second motivation to Howlin’s move.One member of the parliamentary Labour Party privately said this is the main thinking behind the transfer announcement.“If we get a critical mass, and the nature of the scale of that mass could only really be determined based on the outcome of the election and how seat numbers compare, it will get very interesting in terms of government formation.“Looking at how we think the numbers could fall, we could possibly, along with the Greens and Soc Dems, be in a really strong position to make the difference and literally name our price.

That’s our short-to-medium-term priority.”Labour may not even have to vastly improve its Dáil standing to find itself, once again, in the position of post-election powerbroker. Leo Varadkar has privately mused about the possibility of coalition with Labour and the Greens, while Micheál Martin aspires to a centre-left coalition in tune with his social democratic views.Yet many delegates at the Ballsbridge Hotel expressed deep unease about such a swift return to government after Labour’s bruising experience with Fine Gael between 2011 and 2016.The party has yet to recover from the charge that it broke promises made to the electorate in the 2011 campaign.In announcing Labour will not countenance government again until a series of “red lines” on issues like housing, health and other policy areas are met, Howlin is trying to get beyond that era.If he chooses to return to government, he will have to convince the electorate, and his party, that these “red lines” will not be broken."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686169.1541360498!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"old public toilets on kevin st for redevelopment as cafe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe toilets are on a traffic island in Dublin’s Liberties. Photograph: Dan GriffinThe former public toilets on Kevin Street, the last vestige of Dublin’s “Four Corners of Hell”, will be brought back into use as a cafe “as soon as practical”.The toilets sit on a traffic island at the junction of Kevin Street and New Street South and have been out of use for about 20 years despite being relatively intact.The council’s development department is “very keen to put the former public toilets to the markets”, an internal email said this year. “We have had a lot of interest in it,” the email, released under the Freedom of Information Act, added.The Liberties crossroad junction of Kevin Street, New Street South, Dean Street and Patrick Street famously had a pub on each corner. It became particularly rowdy at closing time when Kenny’s, Quinn’s, O’Beirne’s and Lowe’s disgorged their customers onto the streets, earning the junction the nickname “The Four Corners of Hell”.An article on Come Here to Me website describes how the pubs, along with the area’s vitality, were lost during the street-widening mania of 1970s and 1980s when Dublin Corporation ran a dual carriageway through the heart of the neighbourhood, transforming a vibrant community intersection into a soulless traffic junction.In 1979, in an article in The , Frank McDonald lamented how Dublin was being “sacrificed to the insatiable demands of the motor car”. He despaired at the transformation of the corner into a major traffic interchange but he noted that the toilets were to be saved because of their outstanding civic design character. “But there’s no doubt that it will look somewhat incongruous in its new surroundings,” he said.The toilets, now listed on the record of protected structures, are shaded by hornbeam and London plane trees and share the traffic island with a small park which the council has recently tidied up.The council receives a lot of interest in the disused facilities. In correspondence released under Freedom of Information Act, one person involved in the restaurant business said they wanted to refurbish them because it “would make an extraordinary addition to the streetscape”. Another asked if it could be turned into a residential development. “You see the thing is, I’ve fallen in love with the building and the idea of making a home out of it.” One person who wanted to turn the building into a café even prepared a booklet based on what he thought was inside the building.In a draft advertisement prepared by the council in 2017, proposals were sought from people interested in leasing the 65.8sqm premises as a caférestaurant. The ad was never published, however. The council wanted more time to consider their options around the small park as well as the best way of refurbishing the toilets.This month an official in the council’s planning and property development department said “a final decision has not been made whether to refurbish the building ourselves and go to tender for someone to operate it or to place it on the market ‘as is’.“Irrespective of which route we go down the plan is to bring the building back into use as soon as is practical bearing in mind the challenges presented by its historical status. If it goes to the market it is likely to be advertised early next year.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686012.1541364706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"backstop agreement may be close but brexit deal is far from certain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn all-UK customs backstop would have to stay in place until a new “better” deal is agreed in the context of the permanent future relationship deal. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesWhen British and European Union negotiators resume their Brexit talks on Monday they will re-enter what Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, has called “the tunnel”, a mutually-agreed shutdown of external comment and spin which is supposed to facilitate their work.This time, however, according to upbeat weekend stories from Brussels, London and Dublin trumpeting the “imminence” of a deal on the crucial Irish backstop – a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what the outcome of future trade talks between the EU and UK – may be light at the end of this one. British prime minister Theresa May has a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and the Commons goes into recess on Wednesday when EU ambassadors also meet again to assess progress.When the British solemnly agreed with the EU last December in the joint agreement to the necessity for a legally enforceable insurance – backstop – against a hard border in Ireland, they fudged the issue of how that would be achieved.The EU took the view that this could be accomplished only by some forms of controls on the Irish Sea between the UK and Northern Ireland. London decided, however, that this was a red line it would not cross, and suggested instead that it would create an all-UK customs arrangement with the EU.Since then we have been struggling to reconcile the two positions.Among the approaches currently being mooted, sources here and in Dublin suggest, is a formula that would remove EU-proposed references to an exclusively Northern Ireland customs union framework from the backstop, but leave in place strict provisions for the North’s continued, and separate, regulatory alignment with the EU (and checks on the Irish Sea or in the marketplace on goods and animals travelling between the North and Britain).That could be done, sources say, either by removing references to customs arrangements, but leaving in place all their ingredients – like those deconstructed dishes so-favoured by chefs in reality cooking shows – or by removing all the Northern Ireland-specific customs-related provisions in their entirety, and relying instead on the British proposals for an all-UK customs arrangement with the UK.That might be acceptable to the EU and Ireland, but only if there was agreement on how to frame the UK proposal of a “temporary” all-UK customs arrangement in such a way as to make it a binding withdrawal agreement commitment.This version of a backstop would mean that after transition – and before the much-promised comprehensive future relationship is negotiated – the UK would be obliged to remain in a customs relationship with the EU, but would also have to put regulatory barriers at Dover and Channel ports.The removal, however accomplished, from the protocol of references to a Northern Ireland-only customs arrangement could make the Northern element of the backstop easier to sell to Tory unionism – the customs border is particularly toxic for reasons that are not altogether clear.And it might be easier to impose on the DUP as a less-than-perfect but necessary solution to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A confrontation that everyone bar the DUP now believes will be necessary.To date the idea of an all-UK customs union solution has been legally fraught because the EU insists that the idea is legally precluded from a binding article 50 “orce” agreement. It is, they say, a matter for the future relationship treaty, currently being drafted only as a political declaration.There is talk of trying to construct a legal “bridge” between the two agreements. But the issue of enforceability of such a provision is crucial.Ultimately, an all-UK customs backstop would have to stay in place until a new “better” deal is agreed in the context of the permanent future relationship deal.A “better” deal is one that would better safeguard the Irish frictionless border – one logically, it appears to most observers, that involves British continued membership of a customs union and most single-market regulations. The British continue to insist that will not happen.Effectively, in other words, by signing up to an all-UK customs backstop the UK, though it does not admit it publicly, would be committing itself to a permanent customs union arrangement for itself for the sake of not signing up to separate arrangements for the North. As the DUP rightly keeps saying “the backstop is for good”.In what is effectively a private acknowledgment of that reality, and fearful that the EU and Ireland could forever block the ending of the backstop by insisting on what the UK would see as an unrealisable standard for a “better” deal, British negotiators are understood to have been trying to explore the idea of third-party arbitration.The draft protocol contains a reference to the backstop remaining in place “unless and until” a better deal is agreed. Could the interpretation of that phrase and the ending of the need for a backstop be given to an independent third party? Not, of course, the British say, the Court of Justice of the EU. . .While we may be close to an agreement on the backstop, the complexity and interconnectedness of the few remaining issues makes agreement far from certain. The light at the end of this single-track tunnel may not be daylight, but a fast-approaching no-deal train."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686241.1541364557!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 50 000 fathers take two week paternity benefit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe paternity payment will be increased by €5 a week from late March next year. Photograph: IstockMore than 50,000 fathers have taken a two-week paternity leave payment since it was introduced in September 2016.Figures from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection show 51,409 fathers have taken the €240 a week paternity benefit payment over the last two years.Last year, 26,559 fathers availed of the welfare payment, which is offered to fathers who take leave from work after the birth of their child, or after they adopt a child. Up to the start of November this year, 19,837 fathers had taken the paternity benefit payment.The payment will be increased by €5 a week from late March next year, following a decision in last month’s budget.The benefit is available for people covered by PRSI, and 4,100 self-employed fathers availed of the payment since it was introduced.Some 5,787 fathers in Dublin drew down the paternity benefit this year, followed by 2,556 people in Cork, and 1,133 in Galway. The county with the lowest number of paternity benefit payments was Leitrim (142), followed by Longford (144).In the first four months of the scheme, 5,013 fathers took the paternity payment, according to the figures.Minister for Employment Affairs Regina Doherty said she was “delighted” with the uptake of fathers availing of paternity benefit.The department plans to introduce an expanded parental benefit scheme, to give both parents an additional two weeks of paid leave of €245 a week, which can be taken in the first year of the child’s life. The scheme is expected to be in place by the end of 2019, following the passage of required legislation.“This new scheme is designed to be family-friendly and flexible. Parents will be able to take the new paid leave any time, and at the same time if they so wish, during their child’s first year,” Ms Doherty said.“I am particularly happy that, with both paternal leave and this new parental leave scheme, we are creating more opportunities for fathers to have the time to spend with their new arrivals as this greatly benefits both child and parent,” she said.Parents can currently avail of over four months (18 weeks) unpaid parental leave before the child is eight years old."},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Both these options will further depress investment. They will be bad for business and bad for working people.“Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People\u0027s Vote.”Lord Myners, who was appointed as city minister by Gordon Brown in 2008 but now sits as a crossbencher, said: “Any deal will be made from a position of weakness where we have surrendered our principal negotiating cards.“It will be half-formed, casting a long shadow over business confidence, damaging investment and hurting both enterprises and their employees for years to come.”A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU, that works for business and the economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sometimes you just have to get yourself expelled from school. Cleo Rocos, chief executive of tequila company AquaRiva, went (briefly) to a convent school. She didn’t take to the nuns because they had a habit of smacking her over the knuckles with a ruler. One sister had a pronounced moustache. So naturally the young Cleo, aged 11, bought her a pack of\u0026nbsprazors for Christmas. An inspired and kindly thought which probably had the\u0026nbspdesired effect of getting her booted out of the convent. She has never looked back. Ever since she sailed to our shores from Rio, aged 6, and discovered to her shock and horror that the sea was grey (she had never seen grey water before) – chilly too – she has taken it as her life’s mission to inject more colour and warmth into the world. “Tequila,” she tells me, “makes everything seem more wonderful.”Sitting in Cafe\u0026nbspPacifico in Covent Garden on a Friday afternoon sipping margaritas with her, I’m inclined to agree. Note the sipping. “You should only sip tequila,” she says, “unless you’re having something removed without an anaesthetic.” The tradition of throwing it down your throat – possibly with some ancient worm lurking at the bottom of the bottle (which is unfair to worms too) – is “strictly for cowboys”. Cleo Rocos doesn’t just make a very pure and clean-tasting tequila, she is a flame-haired evangelist, a passionate believer. She has even written a book on the subject, one that I doubt her old convent teachers will be putting in the school library: The Power of Positive Drinking. How to drink tequila and actually enjoy itThe surprising health benefits of tequilaFive of the best cocktails for National Tequila DayDrinking tequila is good for your bones, science saysShe was recently stuck on a Tube train in a tunnel on the Central Line, somewhere between Tottenham Court Road and Bank. An announcement came over the PA: “Please stay calm. We should be moving in about 20 minutes.” Cue general gloom and consternation. Then Rocos stood up and made her own personal announcement: “I have two bottles of tequila with me and 20 glasses – anyone care to join me?” The train was magically transformed into a party venue. “Everyone was jolly by the end,” she says. Rocos must like Tube trains: she discovered the young art student who designed her label (a couple dancing on the wing of a plane) on the politan Line.Tequila is now the fastest-growing category among spirits in the world. I think I have just become a convert too. To AquaRiva anyway. What is surprising is that Rocos ever became so keen on tequila herself. She started off with a bad experience during school, post-convent. “It’s like you’re on a bobsleigh to hell. For years I hated tequila,” she says. Tequila in those days was often only 51 per cent agave with a load of raw alcohol and additive on top. “That’s the reason why people try to swallow it without tasting. It was the only way.” She started to swing around to liking tequila\u0026nbspin the late 1980s. Back then Rocos appeared in the Kenny Everett Video Show. After filming, she and Kenny would frequently slope off and have a predominantly liquid lunch, then take a taxi to Heathrow and jump on the first plane to wherever, without a suitcase or even a toothbrush, just for the craic. She came to the conclusion that “wonderful things happen after you’ve had a few drinks”.In her acting career she has inhabited roles ranging from “exotic dancer” to producer, but she defines herself as a comedian. “The last thing I’d want is to get run over without having had a good laugh, or without my lipstick or earrings – I expect to get run over in a moment of mindless glee.” Some years ago she hosted her own TV show for Channel 5, Cleo Worldwide, in which she took “lovely people to lovely locations and we had\u0026nbspcocktails together”.But the real turning point occurred some 16 years ago when she came across a woman in Mexico who “looked like the editor of Mexican Vogue. An older woman but sensational”. She was drinking tequila from a long\u0026nbspfluted glass. “That was when I fell in love. To think I’d spent all those years at the BBC drinking warm white wine, which might just as well have been used to suck the stains out of carpet tiles. And it gave you a headache.”She made her mind up to go into the tequila business. Wise men tried to put her off. Don’t even think about it, they said. It takes eight years for the agave plant to become viable, you need huge investment, etc. But she ploughed on regardless. “If you listened to other people, you’d never do anything. I knew nothing but I learned everything I could about tequila.” She also wants\u0026nbspto give a shout-out to HSBC. “I know banks come in for a lot of flak, but they were with me every step of the way and I couldn’t have done it without them. I didn’t have a lot of money behind me to begin with.” The name “tequila” is owned by the Mexican government. It can only be produced in\u0026nbspselect areas of Mexico. Rocos spent 11 months up in the highlands experimenting and concocting and fine-tuning, communing with a blender guru, and finally creating her own brand. The key is to use only 100 per cent pure organic agave syrup and volcanic spring water, and allow the brew to “rest” – hence “reposado” – in old bourbon barrels for a few months. She still likes to go to Arandas, east of Guadalajara, and get up early in the morning to go up to the agave fields, walk across the deep red earth and join in the harvesting.Tequila makes us into our favourite versions of ourselves – like edited highlightsAquaRiva recently won the “Best of the Best” blind-tasting competition in America. It’s won so many gold medals over the last few years that Rocos says she can’t pin them all on the bottle, otherwise “it would look like some mad dictator”. Her brand is now the “house pour” at TGI Fridays and can be found in many restaurants. The AquaRiva brand of agave syrup is sold in Waitrose and Sainsbury’s. India is likewise opening up to AquaRiva. Bollywood has embraced tequila. The next frontier is the United States. \u0026nbspAquaRiva is sugar free, low on calories and “good for dieting”, Rocos assures me. She is her own living, breathing advertisement for the power\u0026nbspof tequila. When she stands up to go and find another bottle, she doesn’t walk, she dances. “Tequila makes us into our favourite versions of ourselves – like edited highlights.” She is critical of a lot of bad wine, full of additives. “You wake up feeling like you’ve been floating in a chlorinated swimming pool, face down, all night.” Rocos hates to see people bingeing and getting paralytic. On the other hand, she is very much in favour of dancing on tables, or, for that matter, on plane wings. Her slogan is: “Drink wisely, drink AquaRiva.” Of course, the president of the Tequila Society would say that. But there is a funny line of hers that sticks with me and which echoes my own brief, slightly inebriated, totally unreliable experience in Cafe\u0026nbspPacifico. “It should taste like you’re drinking the first day of your holidays – you open the door and you want to run into the sea.”\u0026nbspAs I walk\u0026nbspdown Langley Street and on to Long Acre, I can swear the blue sky looks\u0026nbspsomehow bluer than before, and the sun\u0026nbspjust a little bit sunnier.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The then Tesco boss had just collected the Management Today Most Admired Company and Most Admired Company Leader awards. He was the king of retail, responsible for propelling Tesco to dominance. I asked Leahy what was the pivotal moment, when Tesco began to defeat the competition? He said it was when employees were ordered to think only Tesco, they could no longer refer to something Sainsbury’s, the market leader, had done and how they could ape it. From now on, it was just Tesco. The policy led to the Tesco Clubcard, Tesco  and other innovations, and, after a while, to Tesco’s hegemony. I was thinking of this in relation to Jack’s, Tesco’s new discount chain. Perhaps I am missing something but I cannot see the logic for it. Jack’s is a distraction, a gimmick, one that will not make any difference to Tesco profits and may even end up eroding them. Jack’s: Everything we know so far about Tesco’s new discount storeTesco’s new discount chain Jack’s will be ‘cheapest in town’ Tesco\u0027s Jack\u0027s has a silly name but it\u0027s a better bet than Asbury\u0027s Jamie Oliver is the new face of TescoLet’s believe, however, that Tesco, which went downhill towards the end of the Leahy reign, endured a slump, and is now being revitalised under Dave Lewis, really does see Jack’s as vital to its future prosperity. If so, they appear to have forgotten the Leahy lesson.Jack’s is clearly an attempt to follow the German discounters, Aldi and Lidl. But what Lewis and his cohorts have created is confusing. It’s called Jack’s, in deference to Tesco founder\u0026nbspSir Jack Cohen. He was a great “pile it high, sell it cheap” operator, so for a Tesco budget label, that makes sense. However, in a clear slug at the Germans and their sourcing, Jack’s boasts that “8 out of 10 products are British”\u0026nbspand as backup, there are Union Jacks everywhere. Presumably, based on research showing that some consumers aren’t thrilled with Germanic produce, Tesco has decided to strike a blow for Britain. But that does not make sense, either, because more than enough shoppers are completely content with Aldi and Lidl’s wares. The effect in a Jack’s is to feel like a declaration of war, with Aldi and Lidl firmly installed as the enemy. From the off, Tesco is fighting on someone else’s terms, not its own. And that goes against the Leahy doctrine. Then there’s the size. Tesco is aiming to have 12 stores by Christmas. That equates to a couple of hundred thousand square feet versus a total UK footprint for Tesco of 35 million square feet. Jack’s is a blip on Tesco, so small as to be immaterial. That’s the number of Jack’s stores Tesco is aiming to open eventually, according to reportsEven if Jack’s reached 90 outlets, thought to be the masterplan, that would be insignificant against Tesco’s 3,000. Why bother? Why ert so much effort and management attention on something that does not matter? Being so tiny brings with it another problem. It’s not worth suppliers having a dedicated production line for a mere 12 stores. So Jack’s own-label goods must be Tesco own-label repackaged as Jack’s. Not only does that open up the prospect of cannibalisation, as shoppers who would otherwise purchase the Tesco item buy the same one more cheaply at Jack’s, but the Jack’s margin is being drastically slashed. \u0026nbspNow comes the appliance-of-science bit. Anyone who supposes Aldi and Lidl just push out stock at low prices is wrong. There is calculation in every single thing they do.A fascinating article by advertising planning guru John Lowery (he’s advised Lidl among many others) sheds much light on how they operate. Lowery toured the first Jack’s, at Chatteris, with ex-Lidl boss, Ronny Gottschlich. First they meet iced doughnuts – hundreds, if not thousands, of them. How many can the people of Chatteris eat? But there are no plain and chocolate doughnuts. They’re out of stock. As are the ready meals, but, says Ronny, “The fridge is on. They’re wasting electricity.” Gottschlich produces his ruler and measures the shelf depth. There’s 94mm at the back that is empty, doing nothing. That translates into redundant metal, and cost. All over the store there is Jack’s own label. “That means they can’t get as close to mimicking the brands that they’re trying to gain sales from.” Out comes the stopwatch. It takes an assistant 11.2 seconds to rip off the lid of the box of cooked ham. In Lidl, the perforations are deeper and the packaging\u0026nbspcomes away more easily, in a maximum of 5.3 seconds. Which means the worker can get on with another task. Same with the bleach bottles. In Jack’s, the labels all face the front. Someone has arranged them like that, but such decorative precision takes time. In Lidl, they’re not, “Because it’s a waste of man-hours. The shoppers know it’s bleach. You could be doing something else… like manning the tills.” There are two sizes of\u0026nbsptrollies. “Why? It increases costs.”Gottschlich discovers that four out of five staff at the Jack’s previously worked in a Tesco. “There you go. They’ve learned to turn the packs round at Tesco. It will take months to knock that kind of behaviour out of them.”In obsessing about Aldi and Lidl, in creating Jack’s, Tesco is ceasing to be Tesco. And forgetting the instruction of its former brilliant chief.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the year to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The number of jobs paying below the threshold has actually increased by 1.2 million since 2012, which really hammers home the magnitude of in-work poverty in the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Clearly such a sizeable challenge requires a collective societal effort. For businesses, it’s critical to look beyond the bottom line, instead of focusing on non-monetary aspects like improved staff morale, rising service standards or increased productivity.” \u0026nbspLWF director Tess Lanning said:  “The living wage campaign is about tackling the rising problem of people paid less than they need to live. “Responsible businesses know that the government minimum is not enough to live on, and today’s new living wage rates will provide a boost for hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the UK.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShe added: “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills. We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers. “When they do, thousands of people get a pay rise, but other local employers also follow their lead.

In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the year to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The number of jobs paying below the threshold has actually increased by 1.2 million since 2012, which really hammers home the magnitude of in-work poverty in the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Clearly such a sizeable challenge requires a collective societal effort. For businesses, it’s critical to look beyond the bottom line, instead of focusing on non-monetary aspects like improved staff morale, rising service standards or increased productivity.” \u0026nbspLWF director Tess Lanning said:  “The living wage campaign is about tackling the rising problem of people paid less than they need to live. “Responsible businesses know that the government minimum is not enough to live on, and today’s new living wage rates will provide a boost for hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the UK.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShe added: “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills. We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers. “When they do, thousands of people get a pay rise, but other local employers also follow their lead.

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But its high street outlets in the UK suffered a 1 per cent decline and fell by 6 per cent in Ireland.Paddy Power Betfair chief executive Peter Jackson said: Quarter three was a good quarter for the group. In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

weeksClick to followThe IndependentAn overlooked contributor to the discovery of the DNA double helix and the world’s most famous cosmologist are among those in the running to be the new face of the £50 note.The Bank of England has invited the public to submit the names of\u0026nbspscientific figures they’d like to appear on the new banknote, with a decision set to be announced in six weeks.A shortlist will be drawn up by an expert committee including space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and physicist Simon Singh, with the final decision to be made by the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney.But who are the favourites to\u0026nbspadorn\u0026nbspthe new £50 notes, and what have been their contributions to science and UK society?Many people’s favourite to win will undoubtedly be the recently deceased Hawking, a true scientific superstar whose contributions to science extended far beyond his own discipline.Particle physicist and TV presenter Professor Brian Cox expressed his support for Hawking on the new note,\u0026nbsptweeting: “He made invaluable contributions over half a century to our understanding of cosmology, the early universe and black holes.”Professor Cox added that the former Cambridge academic has inspired thousands of scientists and millions of people through his books and lectures, “me included”.Hawking gave his name to the radiation emitted by black holes, advanced studies of the universe’s origins\u0026nbspand penned the bestselling popular science book A Brief History of Time to transmit ideas from his discipline to more than 10 million readers.Franklin’s work as an X-ray crystallographer at King’s College London produced images that contributed to James Watson and Francis Crick’s identification of the DNA double helix.In the years following her death in 1958, her crucial work has been recognised by many including Watson and Crick themselves, but Franklin was not included in the Nobel Prize the duo went on to win four years later.Franklin’s story is now seen as a cautionary tale about the ways the contributions of women have been ignored over the course of scientific history.A place on the £50 note would be seen by many as a fantastic way to honour a scientist who was never given the recognition she deserved in her lifetime.Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, mentioned Franklin along with palaeontologist Mary Anning as potential faces for the new notes.“They were both underrecognised in their lifetime and now we could set the record straight and recognise the huge achievements they made,” she said.Another figure seen as an overlooked\u0026nbspscientific pioneer from a time when women were not traditionally included in science, Lovelace is often described as the world’s first computer programmer.The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was a mathematician who worked on Charles Babbage’s proposed computer, the Analytical Engine.Lovelace translated an article by an Italian military engineer concerning the engine, adding an elaborate set of notes that contain what some have described as the first ever computer program – an algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.Like Franklin, Lovelace has only recently been recognised for her contribution, and her addition to the new £50 would therefore be a fitting tribute for someone who was not recognised in their lifetime.In his role as a codebreaker during the Second World War, Turing played a major part in helping defeat Nazi Germany by providing the allied forces\u0026nbspwith information that gave them the upper hand in key operations.His work at Bletchley Park during the war cracked the German messages sent by the Enigma machine, and is regarded as making key contributions to the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.Turing was convicted in 1952 under anti-homosexuality laws, leading to him accepting chemical castration and ultimately taking his own life two years later.Though he was posthumously pardoned in 2013, many will surely see a place on the currency as a way to honour his legacy.As the only British woman to become a Nobel science laureate, Hodgkin would be another perfect addition to the UK’s currency, and one who many people are perhaps not familiar with.The chemist won the prize in 1964 for her pioneering work that helped unravel the 3D structure of important substances such as insulin.Her nomination was backed by Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan, who said: “I would personally pick Dorothy Hodgkin, the only female Briton to have won a science Nobel Prize.”“We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers.“She was also a remarkable inidual who championed science in developing countries.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

But for me the most improved in that set of skills was Ranj and Janette.The 5 talking points from Strictly Come Dancing week 7“Again, I don’t want to choose between these two lovely gentlemen but for me the more improved performance on the night was Charles and Karen.”“Can I have them both?! Completely contrasting dances, both very entertaining. But I have to choose the most polished dancer and performer and for that reason I choose Charles and Karen.”“First of all for me it’s a heart-breaking decision ‘cause I think both couples have done amazingly well. Both couples have made little iddy-biddy errors that I can see but due to great timing, sophistication I am going to choose Charles and Karen.”There are now 10 couples left in the competition, which will continue at the usual time of 7pm next Saturday.“I can’t express how much this has meant to me,” Singh said of his time on the show. “I have made friends for life. I’ve done something that I only could have dreamed of. I just want to say to anyone who ever dreams of this you can, you really can, ’cause I’m here and I’ve done it.”Manrara added: “I just want to say he is an incredible human being for what he does as an actual job. He is there saving children’s lives and he is a special, special man. On this show you get to celebrate people that have never done something like this before and for me Ranj is the epitome about what Strictly Come Dancing is about. I couldn’t have asked for a better friend, a better partner or better series I love you so so much. Thank you.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The mural has been on the shop front on Park Row in the artist\u0027s hometown of Bristol since the 1990sIn June, however, Mr Banks told\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee\u0026nbspthat Rock Services was “just a service company” and “just delivers the cash”. He said the “actual loan came from another one of my companies”.Asked repeatedly by Mr Marr\u0026nbspwhat the other company was, the businessman insisted the money had come only from Rock Services.\u0026nbspHe rejected the Electoral Commission’s suggestion that some of the money could have come\u0026nbspfrom Isle of Man-based company Rock Holdings, which owns Rock Services. This would be potentially illegal because, under UK law,\u0026nbspcampaign donations can only be made by firms\u0026nbspregistered in the UK.Mr Banks\u0026nbspsaid the probe into Leave.EU’s funding was “politically motivated” and came after pressure from “a group of vicious Labour MPs who have grouped together with  and the Financial Times to try to undermine Brexit”.The BBC’s decision to host\u0026nbspMr Banks on\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspshow\u0026nbspprompted outrage from other political figures.In a typically aggressive performance, the Brexiteer\u0026nbsplashed out at DCMS\u0026nbspcommittee chairman Damian\u0026nbspCollins, who has\u0026nbspbeen highly critical of him.Asked why he had written to Mr Collins’ constituents in Folkestone and Hythe calling the MP a “snake in the grass”, Mr Banks replied: “Well, he is.”Claims have been made that Mr Banks misled\u0026nbspMr Collins’ committee\u0026nbspin relation to whether staff at another of his insurance companies had worked on the Leave.EU campaign.According to The Observer, leaked emails suggest\u0026nbspemployees of Eldon Insurance worked on the campaign without this being declared as official\u0026nbspspending.Mr Collins suggested the emails appeared to “flatly contradict” what Mr Banks had told his committee in June.\u0026nbspAsked about the matter, Mr Banks told Andrew\u0026nbspMarr: “That was reported to the Electoral Commission. People that\u0026nbspdid work from Eldon were transferred over on short-term contracts\u0026nbsplegally and it was reported through the Electoral Commission in the right way.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Both these options will further depress investment,” the group said\u0026nbspin a letter.“They will be bad for business and bad for working people. Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People’s Vote.”The government’s Brexit department said it was confident of securing a deal that works for businesses, and reiterated its opposition to a second referendum.“The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen, and the prime minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,” a spokesman said.Additional reporting by ReutersThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation. Negotiations are practically at square one for this, with practically no time left.It is widely claimed that any document will have to be a fudge. But the EU said at the Salzburg summit that any outline must be specific – not just a list of vague aspirations.Brexit talks ‘close to a deal’ says DUP leader Arlene FosterGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitArron Banks is hoping to become some kind of Brexit martyrUK construction dogged by Brexit uncertainty in OctoberHow agreement could be reached on anything substantial is unclear, and neither side looks able to back the other’s proposals. It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare. Desperation to avoid this at all costs means that a\u0026nbsplast-minute government U-turn is more than just a possibility\u0026nbsp– it’s likely.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Through the Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes framework we promote excellent teaching and improve information for students including student employment outcomes.“We strongly support the growth of degree apprenticeships. We are demonstrating this through the £8 million Degree Apprenticeship Development Fund and will draw on its evaluation to determine what further steps to take in 2019.”She added: “We require universities and other registered providers to publish details of vice-chancellors’ pay and justify their pay package.“We also require them to publish the number of staff being paid more than £100,000, and ratios showing how the vice-chancellor’s pay compares to that of all other employees. This goes beyond previous requirements.”A Department for Education spokesman said: “Our reforms have seen record rates of disadvantaged 18-year-olds attending our world-class universities and we want this to continue. That’s why we are pleased to see universities and further education colleges planning to spend more than £860 million on measures to improve access and outcomes for disadvantaged students.“We know that what you study and where you study really matters, and we are introducing and developing digital tools that provide data on graduate outcomes that will begin to revolutionise how students choose the right university for them. We are also reviewing post-18 education and funding which will look at how we can ensure greater value for money for both students and taxpayers.“We want to offer students more choice than ever before, which is why it is good news that over 100 universities are now on board and able to offer degree apprenticeships, including many Russell Group universities.“This allows students to get a degree through an apprenticeship while earning a salary, training on the job, meaning they can bring their valuable skills to the workforce sooner than a traditional degree.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOffice for StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is a vote of confidence in the French republic, its future and its values, President Emmanuel Macron said in a speech on French television.Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysThe referendum was the first auto-determination vote to be held in a French territory since Djibouti in the Horn of Africa voted for independence in 1977.Voters in the largely self-governing territory had been asked the question, Do you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?Mr Macron said he understood the disappointment of those who wanted independence, but added that the French state would ensure liberty, equality and fraternity for everyone.AFPGetty Images)The only loser is the temptation of contempt, ision, violence and fear the only winner is the process of peace and the spirit of dialogue, he said.Tensions have long run deep between pro-independence indigenous Kanaks and descendants of colonial settlers who remain loyal to Paris.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Salvadorean migrant with a girl walks next to Guatemalan policemen as they approach the Guatemala-Mexico international border bridge in Ciudad Tecun Uman.

He and his administration sought to strike a neutral tone on the vote.New Caledonia\u0027s economy is underpinned by French annual subsidies of some 1.3bn euros (£1.14bn), nickel deposits that are estimated to represent 25 per cent of the world\u0027s total, and tourism.It enjoys a large degree of autonomy but depends heavily on France for matters such as defence and education.Catalonia independence referendum one year on, how do things look now?First discovered by the British explorer James Cook, the New Caledonia archipelago lies more than 10,000\u0026nbspmiles\u0026nbspfrom France. It became a French colony in 1853.Under colonial rule the Kanaks were confined to reserves and excluded from much of the island\u0027s economy. The first revolt erupted in 1878, not long after the discovery of large nickel deposits that are today exploited by French miner Eramet\u0027s subsidiary SLN.More than a century later, in the mid-1980s, fighting broke out between supporters of independence and those who wanted to remain French, amid festering anger over poverty and poor job opportunities.A 1988 massacre in a cave on the island of Ouvea left 19 indigenous separatists and two French soldiers dead and intensified talks on the island\u0027s future. A 1998 deal provided for a referendum on independence to be held by the end of 2018.Under the terms of that deal, in the event of a no vote two further referenda can be held before 2022.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

(LREM) party in a poll.The Ifop poll of voting intentions for the May 2019 European Parliament elections showed the RN rising from 17 per cent at the end of August to 21 per cent now, moving ahead of the LREM on 20 per cent for the first time.The RN’s 21\u0026nbspper cent, combined with the 7 per cent of Nicolas Dupont-Aignan’s Debout La France (Stand up France) party and one per cent each for Florian Philippot’s Les Patriotes and François Asselineau’s pro-“Frexit” Popular Republican Union gave far-right parties a combined 30 per cent total.Before our eyes, Italy is becoming a fascist stateThis was up five percentage points from 25 per cent of voting intentions at the end of August.\u0026nbspSunday’s poll provides striking evidence that France has shifted towards the far right since Macron easily beat Le Pen, leading what was then known as the\u0026nbspFront National, in the second round of voting in the 2017 French presidential election.It also gives further cause to believe that the European Parliament elections in 2019 are shaping up to be a major battle between centrist, pro-EU parties such as\u0026nbspMacron’s LREM, and far-right formations that want to stop immigration and globalisation.Created with Sketch.

The Netherlands and Spain were the only other EU countries in the top ten.That is some achievement for the UK. And demonstrates that the people who know where to invest, know it should be in the UK.They know we live in a dynamic nation, brimming with potential.So as we leave the European Union, we should remember the many reasons investors choose to put their money here in the United Kingdom, which is one of the world’s largest and most successful economies.We are at record levels of employment. Our success is underpinned by a legal system whose reputation is second to none.

We continue to attract more Foreign Direct Investmentthan anywhere  in Europe. And we are the number one choice in Europe for key strategic investments, such as headquarters. So it’s easy to see why more than , new businesses start up here every day.And it isn’t just small and medium-sized businesses. The UK has created  of Europe’s  companies valued at more than billion.Only this week Monzo, the British bank which operates through an app on your phone, secured £million of investment in order to double its workforce. This raised the company’s value to the £billion mark just three years after its formation.This is a fantastic vote of confidence in the UK and yet another sign that we have plenty to be optimistic about after we leave the EU.Investment creates jobs across all parts of the UK, pumps money into our communities and improves the lives of millions of people.Last year, FDI created , new jobs in the UK as well as safeguarding another ,.One reason we are seeing so much success is that this government has built an environment that makes investment and job creation easy.We are champions of free trade and we actively encourage businesses of all sizes — from start-ups to large corporations — to build trading links in all corners of the world.This weekend I’ll be representing the UK at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai where we are a “country of honour”.Over recent months, China has started to open up its market for UK goods and services, including dairy products, potatoes and petrol stations.And, this weekend, we intend to build on these achievements and create even more exciting opportunities for British companies.We also possess world-class talent. For example, we excel at research and development, which means that overseas companies want to tap into British expertise to advance the quality of their products. In last week’s Budget, we announced a further £.billion to strengthen the UK’s global leadership in science and innovation — that brings the total to £billion invested in research and development since .We want a partnership with business to make our country prosper.The Government’s Industrial Strategy includes innovative deals agreed with inidual sectors to attract investment. We are already reaping the rewards.The global marketplace never slows and we, too, must never stand still.Building on our impressive investment success, I have implemented the High Potential Opportunities scheme, which will deliver growth where it is most needed, often to previously overlooked areas.The success of the AgriTech programme in the West Midlands town of Telford and Leicestershire’s leading space sector cluster are proof the benefits of global investment are being felt in every part of the country.Over recent months, the Department for International Trade has led a series of investment roundtables, promoting UK industry to a global audience and driving foreign direct-investment into the UK as we prepare to leave the European Union.So far, these events have centred on tech, le sciences, automotive and agri-tech sectors and will soon start to focus on areas such as the creative industries.Initiatives such as this are going to be key in the coming months as we develop the UK’s own independent trade policy for the first time in more than  years.Working with businesses in the UK and overseas, I am determined to continue generating this flow of good news.But the facts tell a dferent story: Confidence in Britain is riding so high around the world that foreign investors are betting on it like never before.New UN figures show that in the first six months of  we were second only to booming China in attracting investment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After her fth son, Alfred, died of his wounds in a hospital near Boulogne in July , Margaret was terried that Wilfred, her last boy, would also be killed.“So Mrs Bircham took the brave step of writing to Queen Mary and begging her to help save Margaret from any further sadness by bringing Wilfred home.”Amazingly, just days later, the Queen’s private secretary, Edward Wallington wrote back to say Her Majesty had contacted the War Office to find Private Smith in the trenches and order him home.The extraordinary events happened  years before Steven Spielberg made his World War Two film Saving Private Ryan, which echoed Wilfred’s story.Margaret and John Smith’s two years of hell had begun in September , when their -year-old son Robert was killed in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, on the Somme.He had given up his job as a labourer to join the sixth battalion of his local regiment, the Durham Light Infantry, soon after war broke out in .Robert died just  weeks after arriving in France. He had been among  men who had wrongly been told the Germans were retreating from their position, known as the Starfish Line.At . on the morning of September , , in pouring rain, he was hit by enemy machine gun fire. He was taken to a casualty station where at first he and elder brother George, , who was in the same battalion, joked together. But three days later Robert died from his wounds. He was buried near the town of Albert.After his death, four brothers — George, John, Frederick and Alfred — came home on leave and posed for the photo above that would turn out to be their last together.Wilfred, then working as a mill hand, was not in the picture as he had not yet been called up.On Bonfire Night  George was in an attack on the Butte de Warlencourt, a ft prehistoric burial mound on the Somme, when he was shot through the head by a sniper as he waded through waist-deep mud.His body disappeared under the surface to be lost for ever.His name is carved into the wall of the Thiepval Memorial, along with , other British victims of the Somme who have no grave.Frederick, , was wounded on Christmas Eve  and was sent to recover at home, where he remained until February, .The following week, Wilfred joined up. Five months later, on the opening day of the third battle of Ypres, Frederick was killed.He and his comrades in the th Durham Light Infantry went over the top into a hail of machine gun fire.After driving the Germans from Imperfect Trench they pushed on but dozens, including Frederick, were mown down as they attacked a German fortication. Frederick has no grave but his name can been seen on the Menin Gate in Ypres, where every day since  the Last Post has been played.Margaret’s eldest son, John Stout, , who was married with two daughters, had been born out of wedlock.His name is carved in the Tyne Cot memorial in Belgium after he was killed on October ,  at Passchendaele and his body never found. The Smiths’ nightmare continued the following summer, when their fth son, -year-old Alfred, was wounded in battle on the Ardre river.He died of his wounds at a military hospital in Wimereux, near Boulogne, on July , .Just three weeks later, Queen Mary received the letter begging her to end Margaret Smith’s heartache and bring her last son home.By then Wilfred was a -year–old, battle-hardened Tommy who had fought the Germans hand-to-hand in the trenches south of Ypres.Queen Mary sent Wilfred home where he became a stonemason and chimney sweepHe had survived mustard gas attacks and was training for the final skirmishes of the war at Terdeghem, on the French-Belgian border, when a messenger arrived with orders from Army headquarters to pack his kitbag and go home.Military historian John Sheen, an expert on the Durham Light Infantry, said: “Mrs Smith’s story must have touched the Queen’s heart because taking a man from the line for personal reasons is extremely rare.”Wilfred ed home to Barnard Castle and became a stonemason and chimney sweep, like his dad John, who died in .Despite suffering chronic chest problems from the mustard gas attack for the rest of his le, he lived until he was  and raised five children with his we Hannah.Granddaughter Amanda, , says: “As children we knew a little bit about Wilfred’s amazing story. My mum would tell us some of it but Grandad did not really talk about it.“I think it was probably hard for him in some ways, as he was lucky to leave the war behind — though the people in Barnard Castle didn’t see it that way. Few people can imagine what it must have been like for him to lose five brothers.”On Sunday Wilfred’s daughter Dianne, , Amanda and her daughter Charlene, , son Craig, , and grandson Tommy, two, will plant poppy crosses at Barnard Castle’s war memorial, where the names of the tragic brothers are remembered.Sergeant Fritz Niland – Private James Ryan in the film – was part of the Allied D-Day operation to take back mainland Europe from the Nazis.But when the US military were led to believe that all three of Fritz’s brothers had been killed in action, they sent him home so the family would have one son left.The film, starring Matt Damon as Private Ryan, tells how heroic Captain John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, leads a group of soldiers to track down Ryan amid the chaos of war and send him home.But the real-le twist for Fritz Niland was that while his brothers Preston and Bob had both died fighting in France, his other brother, Edward, had wrongly been listed as having been killed.Edward had in fact been captured by the Japanese after parachuting into Burma in  and held as a prisoner of war.He was freed when the prison camp was liberated in May  and ed to live in the US until his death in  at the age of .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wouldn’tI wasn’t going away with the boys. We’re all just having a quick one. You can’t legislate for the idiots that cause the problems.”Mark Smith, , was heading from Bristol to Dublin for a pal’s stag do. He said: “If this legislation comes into place, it’s the airports that are going to be losing out on a heck of a lot of money.I’ve just spent £ on a round of  beers and a little bit of breakfast. It’s chucking money into the economy.”For some travellers, drinking helps with their fear of flying.Worried advertising boss Chris Andrews ordered his first beer at am before a flight from Manchester airport to Malaga. Chris, , from Cheltenham, said: “I’m a nervous flier so I want a beer to steady my nerves.”Nurse Michelle Nowell, , was also drinking at Manchester Airport with her mum Ann and pal Jane Bennett before flying to Tenere.Michelle said: “They shouldn’t be trying to spoil the start of people’s holiday just be- cause a few people can’t control themselves.”Bridget Kizza, , was having a cocktail at .am at Glasgow Airport on the way to Lanzarote. She said: “Alcohol can be more of a problem on the streets but it’s not as bad in airports.”The proposed crackdown would apply to duty free shops and restaurants, as well as the bars. So there would be no carrying on a bottle of booze ready for the first night of the holiday or having a quick glass of wine with breakfast.At Luton Airport the early fliers didn’t want their party spirit dampened.Champagne-swigging account manager Tracy Waldron, , of Peterborough, Cambs, who was heading to Lithuania with her pal Vicki, said: “I haven’t seen any rowdiness today but last time I was here there was a drunk man and that was at . in the morning. His we was really annoyed at him.”Punishments are already strong. Passengers who disrupt a flight can be jailed — andthey cause a flight to be erted they might be forced to pay up to £,.But not everyone thinks that planes and pints are a good mix. Ryanair has called for am to be the earliest that alcohol can be served because the number of booze-related disruptions on planes has doubled in two years.Oliver Bynon — who was flying to Amsterdam from Bristol to celebrate his st birthday with his brother Alex and two friends — agreed.He said: “You wouldn’t drink anywhere  this early. I’m only doing it because we’re celebrating my st.

It doesn’t really affect us but we have been in flights with people who are drunk and it’s not very good at that time in the morning.“I guess you do get a small number of people who spoil things for everyone and I don’t see another way of changing it other than limiting the amount people drink before they get on a flight.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But by claiming that’s a living wage, they’re either conning the public or conning themselves. Because across Britain, many people earning that wage will still struggle to keep their heads above water. Just paying for the basics - like food - will be a battle. That’s why we at the TUC are calling on all employers to pay the Real Living Wage. It’s a higher rate , calculated to give workers a wage packet they can build a decent le on. But instead of helping out the lowest-paid, Theresa May and her government have chosen to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations.

The younger boy underwent surgery to have the bullet removed from his stomach on Saturday. Detectives are carrying out round the clock enquiries to find whoever fired the gun which includes extensive CCTV analysis being carried within the area. The shot is believed to have come from someone in a car who then fled the scene.  West Midlands Police, Detective Superintendent Maria Fox said: We as a police force, and the community as a whole, are absolutely shocked, appalled and outraged that two children have been shot at and seriously injured. All gun crime is completely unacceptable but the fact that two teenage boys, who were just out and about enjoying the festivities have suffered pain at the hands of a weapon is even more galling. There can be no excuse or justication to shoot towards young people and it makes us all the more determined to catch the coward who did this. I can assure everyone that we wont stop until we bring them to justice. We have a number of active lines of enquiry but at this stage we dont believe the boys were deliberately targeted. But that is no solace for them as they recover from their injuries and psychological torment this will have undoubtedly brought.  I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw a car behaving suspiciously between around -.am maybe driving slowly or repeatedly seen in the area. We believe there were a lot of other vehicles in the area at the time and we need those drivers to come forward - especiallythey have dash cam footage. No arrests have been made and police are trying to establish a motive and trace the gunman.

Steff Barnett, , who was born Steve, knew for many years she was a gay woman trapped in a man’s body. But she only started the process of changing gender after the couple’s two sons had left home. And despite the problems it has posed, nurse Lynne, , decided to remain with the person she married. They no longer have an intimate physical side to their relationship but say they are still happy together.  Radio presenter Steff said: “Lynne misses her husband desperately... “The guilt was horric. I felt as though I’d let Lynne down. I love her passionately even now. “She’s stayed by me, she was brave enough to do that, even though she’s just about lost her husband. “There’s this huge love thing going on between us. It’s almost a meshed soul but something is twisting it, trying to pull it apart.” Lynne said: “When he started to transition I knew there was no turning back. “But I loved Steve enough to know this was the only way forward.” She added that as far as she is concerned they will always stay married. The pair, from Bradley Stoke, Bristol, met in a pub in  when Lynne was , and they watched Hollywood movie Shaft on their first date.  But Lynne was not initially convinced by her suitor – leading to several awkward months. She said: “He would come to my house and I would hide in the back room and my mum would go absolutely crazy. She would say ‘he’s come round to see you, you have to go. I’m not going to tell him you’re not in’.” The pair soon saw past their dferences and married within a year of those first dates. Two weeks later the husband had a confession for Lynne – he enjoyed wearing women’s clothes. Steff said: “I couldn’t use the term gender dysphoria because I had no clue what that was. “But neither of us knew the consequences of what was coming.”  Lynne added: “It wasn’t once said ‘I think I’ve been born in the wrong body’. We thought it was a sexual thing [he was] going through. “It didn’t bother me he wanted to put on stockings or suspenders or a skirt. I didn’t even think about it because it wasn’t something that was done all the time.” Apart from Lynne knowing, Steff kept it a secret about wearing women’s clothes for decades. The couple had two children and Steff feared living openly as a woman while their sons were young because of concerns over playground bullying. She said: “We knew how cruel schoolkids could be andI had transitioned when I was younger it would have wrecked their lives I’m sure. “Every waking moment I had to suppress this feeling of ‘I’m not me’... I’m not me’. “My thoughts and my feelings were dragging at me constantly.”  In  Steff decided the time was right to think about transitioning. She said: “We had three years of talking and talking to try and sort the issue. I don’t think I would be hereI didn’t transition. “So Valentine’s Day when I went in I had surgery I walked out with Lynne and I just whooped for joy. “I took my first breath outside... It was a very emotional moment.” But Steff admits things are not perfect. Speaking to the BBC, she said: “I miss the intimacy. I really do. But Lynne can’t make that leap. “Lynne had to go through the loss of her husband and then after that I had to go through the loss of my we.” Lynne misses having a man’s arms around her.  The mum said: “Steff is gay, she’s liked women, she’s always liked women. I’ve always been  per cent heterosexual. I miss him [Steve] every day. “To have a man’s hands around you, kissing you, protecting you. “I’m not in her head to understand to see how she thinks. And she’s not in my head to feel what I’ve lost.  “She is a very tactile person who likes to be cuddled and kissed and hug and hold hands and I can’t do that. I just can’t do it.” Lynne added: “She says ‘well you can cuddle your friends when you’re down’ but my friends have always been in that female form... They weren’t my husband to start with.” Since transitioning, Steff has become a presenter at BCfm Radio, hosting a weekly show on Fridays.  Steff said: “I am so, so happy. It was always a dream to get into radio. That didn’t happen until I transitioned. I am much more confident. “And I’m probably the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire le. And I’m now me. “We still love each other. And I guess that’s what got us through this.” Lynne said: “There have been other people in my le but there isn’t anyone that I would want to be with more than I want to be with Steff.  “Our marriage certicate still says Steve Barnett and Lynne Hogan and as far as I’m concerned that is a sacred piece of paper to me and that’s how it will always be. “We’ve had a hell of a journey. Ups and downs, good and bad and I just can’t see us just not being together. “You just count your blessings and think that things could be so much worse. I’m one of the lucky ones.”The couple told their story to BBC Inside Out West.

ButPrime Minister David Lloyd George had his way, that shyunforgettable time and date  years ago this Sunday would not have been so evocative. Worse, it would have cost thousands of lives. A century ago Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, First Sea Lord – and “Rosie” to his family – was picked as the British delegate at the signing of the Armistice.  The agreement would bring an end to four years of the most bitter and bloody fighting Europe had seen. In a rickety railway carriage, a former dining car turned makesht office, parked up in woodland in Compiegravegne, in northern France, Sir Rosslyn joined the Supreme Allied Commander, Frenchman Marshal shyFerdinand Foch, and the German delegation. After much shuttling between that carriage and the Germans’ own – parked a few metres along the track – the shyArmistice was signed at .am and the ceasefire announced at am.  But today, Sir Rosslyn’s great-great-nephew, Michael Wemyss, , reveals Lloyd George wanted the shyceasefire at .pm, rather than the famous th hour. It would have a been a costly choice... He says: “He was instructed by Lloyd George to ensure the Armistice took effect at .pm. “The story is, Rosie rang King George V and between them decided there was no point holding off, so they brought it forward to the th hour, am.  “Lloyd George wanted to announce it in the Commons and take the glory. George V announced it and Lloyd George had the rug pulled out from under him. “Every hour saved lives.” But siding with the king against the prime minister cost Sir Rosslyn, , dear. “Lloyd George was furious, and shywithheld Rosie’s pound, grant – all the service chiefs got a thank you. They all got earldoms too!” says Michael.  “Rosie was furious. He felt what he had done was to everyone’s benefit other than Lloyd George personally and this was a vendetta.” Sir Rosslyn’s shydecision, backed by George V, a cousin and friend, with whom he had served in the navy, wasn’t his only shyleshyshysaving action during the First World War. He was responsible for getting all the British and Australian troops out of Gallipoli in Turkey in , after their campaign failed spectacularly. “When the army decided to retreat he managed to get all the soldiers off the peninsula without a single death,” says Michael proudly. Alongside him was Captain John Peter Ralph Marriott – and it was to Marriott that Sir Rosslyn turned to assist him at the momentous signing of the Armistice.  Today, his grandson Charles Marriott, , says his ancestor was also always hugely proud of his presence that day. And it was he who phoned the King’s personal secretary to reveal the shydocshyshyument had been signed. “It took him half a day desperately trying to get through,” Charles reveals.  Then only , Charles was gted the blotting paper that was used to dry the ink of the signatures as a memshyento. He always recalled the tense shyatmosphere in the carriage – and the aggressive exchanges between the rather cocky Allied contingent, and their crushed enemy. The Germans had been forced to hand over all their artillery, machine guns, naval fleet, and air force.  “There was quite a lot of rudeness in the carriage,” says Charles. “The German delegation said, ‘We need an Armistice, our people are starving’ – the Navy had blockaded the German ports. And Wemyss told them, ‘You look fat enough!’ “The German replied, ‘As you well know, Admiral, we are the people who don’t suffer in these situations’.” On the French side Eacuteric Beacutecourt-Foch, great-grandson of Marshal shyFerdinand Foch, says his ancestor had a very personal reason for relishing his signing of the Armistice. Foch lost his own son, as well as his son-in-law, Eacuteric’s grandfather, on August , , during the Battle of the shyFrontiers when , French soldiers were killed in less than  hours.  “He did not learn of their deaths for a number of months, the armies were in retreat and it was a great mess,” says Eacuteric, . “News didn’t get through.” Movingly, family man Foch, in deep mourning, wrote to his we nearly ever day during the conflict. “It must have meant all the more to him to finally sign the Armistice,” says Eacuteric of that incredible moment. It was Foch’s carriage where the signing took place – and  years later it was also the location of another historic moment.  When France signed an armistice with the Germans in  during the Second World War, Adolf Hitler ordered that it take place in the same carriage in Compiegravegne, so the Germans could lord it over their enemies. Then the carriage was taken to Berlin and exhibited – until in , as the Nazis realised defeat was coming, they blew up it up in one final act of revenge.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

The man came close to falling from a bridge over the M but was saved when an ambulance crew spotted him as they passed underneath it. Police arrived moments later, shut the motorway and spoke to the -year-old, who has asked not to be named, until he came down. He later went on social media and was shocked by some of the insensitive comments from drivers who were outraged over the traffic disruption and unconcerned about his well-being, he told the Manchester Evening News.  They included Just jump I need to get home, Make sure he gets carted away before I start work and Tell him to get a move on. The man was taken to hospital after he was talked down from the bridge but was left alone in a room and went back to the bridge just hours after. The same police officers brought him back down and stayed with him in the hospital room overnight.Months on, he said he feels awful that police officers were taken off the streets that night and that traffic disruption was caused by the incident. But some of the comments he saw on social media made him feel much worse. Now, he wants to appeal to social media users to think twice before making an off-hand comment - in a bid to raise awareness of the devastating consequences it could have.  He said: To those posting on social media, just think - you never know that could be your mum, or dad up there. Whatthat person looks at the article, reads all of these comments and then goes back out there  It a shame that society feels like that. There is still a lot of stigma about mens mental health and mental health in general. Last week I saw two friends and I was talking to them about when I came out of hospital. They were with a girl Id never met before and she said oh you are a psycho as well. Whatthat was somebody   It could go and set them back. I am thick-skinned, but when I see the comments made about other people I get upset about it. He also explains there is one phrase that he finds particularly damaging, often said to men in his situation. The man said: When it is men people say man-up. My girlfriend at the time kept saying that. It really grates, it hurts inside. It feels like my stomach drops, it makes you feel worse. As a man you are supposed to be one type, but I am a bit feminine - I like things tidy. Saying it to someone suffering from mental health doesnt help. Since he tried to take his own le the man has received treatment at a mental health unit and is now living in supported housing. During his first week out of the hospital he says support workers visited every day, but since then no-one has been to see him.  He was diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder at a young age. Those with the disorder can experience very intense emotions, feel deeply about what others think and can behave impulsively. The man has been told by medics he needs to undergo intensive therapy, but it has never materialised. He said: I have never had therapy. I have spent six years waiting for it. There is that many people getting sectioned daily you just get lost in the system. There is no support, they wont help people until you are suicidal. I am on a mixture of tablets for my mental health and Codeine pain killers. Sometimes I am that knackered I dont go out a lot. I cant work. I was working before, full time. While theres been a lack of mental health services and support since, the dad is hugely grateful to the emergency services who attended the bridge that day. He credits the police officer who spoke to him, and the ambulance crew that first spotted him, with saving his le. The man said: If people hadnt come out I dont think I would be here. I am grateful, especially to the police woman that talked me down, who was really nice. She came back and got me again. She was really lovely, came to check on me as well after to seeI was alright. It couldve been a dferent storyit was a man, she was softly spoken and calmed me down. Its not the first time Ive attempted to take my le, but its the first time I have in three years. If you are going through same thing go and get help. But I know myself, its OK saying get help to others, but when you are in that mind frame you are not thinking about your children. All you think about is ending your le. With me it is emotional, I get angry, I dont feel sociable like everybody , making plans stresses me out. There needs to be more information out there, about what to do. Dont judge peopleyou put a comment up on something like that , think whatthat is your own kids  Elizabeth Simpson, Service Director at Manchester Mind, said: Not all suicides are mental health related but the vast majority are - and unfortunately situations like this show that there remains a lack of understanding about suicide. There is still a lot of stigma, but people in crisis need support and understanding, not judgement and impatience. “With one in every four people experiencing a mental health problem each year there has never been a greater need for services, and Manchester Mind’s vision is of a city that promotes good mental health and that treats people with mental health problems positively, fairly and with respect.

The trail left by double agent Sergei Skripal’s would-be assassins Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga in Salisbury in March humiliated the Kremlin. The GRU has also left its tracks on the cyber-attack in The Hague as well as the hacking of the US presidential campaign, the German federal parliament’s network and prosecutors probing the shooting down of an plane over Ukraine.  Ex-NATO chief Hamish de Bretton-Gordon called Russia’s equivalent of our MI “inept, unprofessional and slapdash responsible for a series of debacles and almost Monty Python-esque.” He said: “The GRU is in meltdown. There have been purges. Our intelligence agencies are watching with wry shyamusement at how bad they are.”  Russian President Vladimir Putin is privately furious with the Moscow-based GRU. A former senior KGB officer said: “Putin was a KGB man – he always had his doubts about the GRU and this failed mission has only emphasised those.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen offers meghan markles mum","story":"NewsQueen offers Meghan Markles mum huge privilege - but she didnt do the same for Kate Middletons familyThe Queen has reportedly reached out to Meghan Markles mum Doria Ragland ahead of the festive periodShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsMeghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Queen has reportedly invited Meghan Markles mum to spend Christmas Day with the Royal Family at Sandringham. In a touching but very unusual move, Her Majesty has asked Doria Ragland to join her daughter and the rest of The Firm for the festivities this year. Its a huge honour to Doria as its extremely rare for the Queen to invite a non-royal to join them, and its never been extended to Kates family. A source told the Sunday Express: Its a mark of the Queens respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesnt have any other relations in this country - unlike Kate who has the support of a very close family.  In previous years the Middletons have joined the Royals for church in the morning, but they were always based at Kate and Williams Anmer Hall home rather than on the royal estate. Doria has reportedly impressed the Queen with the dignity she has shown while other members of Meghans family have cashed in on her new royal status.  Meghan is very close to her mum and asked her to be by her side when she launched her first solo venture as a Royal. She helped set up a charity cookbook in aid of a community kitchen which supports the community affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy.  Doria reportedly fell in love with England during her stay for the Royal Wedding earlier this year, and many fans she may decided to leave her home in Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, and move over her. Meghan and Harrys announcement that they are expecting their first child in the spring has only added to the speculation.

Ross, , was joined for the final mile of his ,-mile journey by  other swimmers,  of whom had swum the English Channel. He did his last few strokes of front crawl before coming ashore where he had begun, in Margate, Kent. He said: “I had to put my goggles on. I was getting really emotional.  “I thought I was going to fall over. And then I started running – that was a mistake. I was really wobbly. “It feels a bit weird. Feels a bit too solid for my liking.” He left Margate on June  and then circumnavigated Britain by front crawl in a clockwise direction. He had expected it to take  days and told his family “sorry I’m late” as they greeted him alongside hundreds of others on the beach.

Ross’s odyssey has been compared to that of Captain Matthew Webb, who in  became the first person to swim the English Channel.

As concerns for her welfare grew hundreds of people volunteered to join the search party and the police issued a renewed appeal. Last week black and white images taken from a CCTV camera came to light.  They appear to show a car parked on the bank of the Thames and a hooded man, who spends eight minutes in the area, leaving the car twice to walk towards the river. Having left the vehicle and walked towards a wall running along the riverbank, the man s to his car after less than a minute. A minute later, he exits the vehicle again and heads towards the river and out of the camera range. Two minutes later he reemerges and drives off. The footage, which was filmed five days after the beautician was last seen, was enough to prompt police ers to scour mudflats yards from where the hooded man stood.

He was released three days later and is on bail until November . Police have said the case is a ‘potential murder inquiry’.

Student Rachel Holmes claims she keeps finding human POO on her Renault Clio - and it is every bit as stomach-churning as it sounds. It has already happened twice in  days, and she is now desperately trying to track down the mystery poo bandit before it happens again. Rachel, , who goes to Swansea University, usually parks her car in a small cul-de-sac behind her house in King Edwards Road in the Brynmill area of Swansea. She said: I am convinced its going to happen again. I have no idea who is doing it - not many people know I have a car.  I do not knowits a personal thing or not - I am just confused. We have no problems with our neighbours and the car was parked in a dferent place each time I do not knowit is drunken vandalism. Adding to the disgusting mystery, she has been unable to find any scratches or marks on the vehicle. This suggests it was not freshly produced.  Rachel, who is in her fourth year studying English and French, had to enlist the help of her friends to help her clean it up the first time. The first one was a bit runny at the beginning and it had hardened, so me and my friends had to chisel it off the windscreen. Then it didnt come off until it chucked down with rain. The second one was huge. That person does need to see a doctor but it was more fibrous so we could just chuck it on the floor.  She now checks her car everyday, evenshe does not need to use it. She has been considering putting a camera in her car, but fears the vile bandits will steal that instead of of pooing over her windscreen. Ms Holmes’ story has already attracted a lot of attention in the area, with some people suggesting that she take the poo to the police for DNA testing.

The teenager was among five boys who targeted Janice as she sat on a park bench in Suffolk in what a court heard was a despicable attack.An image showing them smiling and pointing at their cowering victim sparked widespread revulsion after being posted on Snapchat and Facebook. Until this week, the boys - all between  and  years old at the time - had had their identities protected because of their age.

Speaking out yesterday, the teenager - who pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour - described how he has received death threats from strangers.He told Sun Online: I’m struggling to leave the house at the moment.

He described the incident as a despicable attack on a vulnerable woman and said it was “terrying” for the mum-of-one.Mr Islett told one boy: “She didn’t know what was going to happen or what the outcome was going to be.  You have got to put yourself in the victim’s place and consider your actions and the effect it might have on them.” Janice was sitting in a park when she was approached by Semple and the group. Ipswich Youth Court heard they began asking questions about drugs before one of the boys spat in her face. Prosecutor Wayne Ablett said: He came from behind the bench and spat at her, with spit landing on her face. She said, What did you do that for  She recalls the boy laughing at her, then spitting at her again. Magistrates heard the group disappeared for around  minutes, then ed with flour bought at a nearby shop.

Janice suffered no physical injuries but was left severely distressed by her ordeal. Semple, who admitted threatening behaviour, lives in Bury St Edmunds with his mum. The court heard since the incident he had received death threats, and felt remorseful and sorry for what happened. Declan Gallagher, defending Semple, said: He took the photograph and put it on his own Snapchat. One of his circle then took a screenshot of that, then it went onto Facebook, then it went beyond. He was released on bail, to be sentenced at an adult court on December . Four other boys, aged , ,  and , admitted the same offence yesterday and were sentenced to -month referral orders.

A ceremonial Beefeater guard began the lighting ceremony by bringing a flame down from the tower into the moat, which had been submerged in smoke. Dozens of representatives from the armed forces and volunteers then used the flame to ignite thousands of other torches staked into or placed on the ground underneath the tower, bathing the barren moat in light. Midshipman Balraj Dhanda of the Royal Navy, a volunteer who helped light the flames, described the spectacle as really, really powerful.  I think it creates the right atmosphere for people to have their own personal reflections and gives people time with their own thoughts, he added. It took around  minutes to light the flames, which then burn for roughly four hours. The ceremony was accompanied by a specially commissioned sound installation featuring choral music, as well as words from war poet Mary Bordens Sonnets To A Soldier. The ceremony was amazing, according to Dick Harrold, governor of the Tower of London.  He added: What is so special about it is it means many dferent things. The message with the sound is not focused so much on those that were lost, but those that were left behind, the bereaved and others who were affected by war. The success of the  display of poppies at the tower meant Historic Royal Palaces, who maintain the landmark, were keen to mark the centenary of Armistice. He added: But, of course, we couldnt do poppies again. Spectators gathered on vantage points around the tower to witness the spectacle.  A minutes silence was also observed. The ceremony, named Beyond The Deepening Shadow, will be repeated each night until the final showing on Remembrance Sunday. Members of the public can watch the spectacle for free.

Presley and Elias Trejo, from Fort Worth, Texas, welcomed baby girl Emerson Faye on July  but she passed away less than two weeks later after contracting the Herpes Simplex Virus after someone gave her a kiss. Mum Presley took to Facebook to warn others about what can happen when people kiss babies that arent their own.The emotional post, which has been shared more than , times, told of how baby Emerson Faye died after receiving the kiss of death as the virus is particularly harmful to babies because of their weak immune system.  She wrote: Emerson ended up passing away from what is called the HSV- virus. It’s the Herpes Simplex Virus most commonly known as the cold sore virus or the kiss of death for infants. For adults it’s not a big deal. But for infants with little to no immune system, it’s fatal. When someone who has the virus in their system and kisses an infant it can spread rapidly. You can have the virus and not even know you have it. You don’t have to have an active cold sore to pass it on. Presley, who is also mum to two boys, went on to describe how the disease slowly attacked her daughters body. She continued: You shed the virus in your saliva and when it gets on the baby it goes through the body so fast. It attacks the brain first.  It shows up as a type of meningitis. It’s fluid based around the vertebrae and goes straight the the brain. It then spreads to all their organs. It happens so fast that you don’t even know the baby is sick. In Emerson’s case, when we arrive to the hospital, her liver was completely gone. Her kidneys were right behind. Everything was failing. She was having multiple seizures until she was brain dead. Her heart stopped beating and the only thing that kept her alive were machines. My daughter, my own flesh and blood who I created out of love, was on le support and I had to be the one to pull the plug on her le. A mother should never ever have to bury their child. The virus took her at just  days old and we watched her die a very slow death. And now I have a letime without her. Presley then delivered a stark warning to others and said she decided to share her story in order to raise awareness. She added: Everyone needs to know about this virus and what it does to children and their families! PEOPLE!!!! STOP KISSING BABIES THAT ARE NOT YOURS!!!!! WAS YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU ARE AROUND NEWBORNS!!!!! I have seen stories about other infants passing from this same virus but you never think it’s going to happen to you. Well this time, it did. My babies don’t have their sister and my husband and I lost our only little girl.  Doctors don’t see this very often. There’s not a lot of cases on this but it’s starting to sp and more. And now it happened right here to us. Our perfectly healthy, happy, BEAUTIFUL angel is no longer here with us because of a terrible virus that people need to be more aware of. People need to know about this sickness. This is a serious and dangerous illness. Do your part, stop kissing babies and start washing your hands. These babies don’t deserve it. Emerson didn’t deserve it. I, as a mother and we, didn’t deserve it. My husband and kids don’t deserve it. And now we will live a whole le time of what ’s. I will never see her go to kindergarten, graduate high school or college, my husband will never walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, I will never see her be a better mother than me. It’s not fair!! We should have never had to go through this. I love you Emerson Faye. I will carry on your name and your love till eternity. I will never forget you. I will never stop loving you.

The news of the birth, which emerged in September, was followed by claims last month that fish and other forms of le are quickly filling up Dead Sea sinkholes.Hebrew prophet Ezekiel’s end-of-days prophecy foresees the sea - a hypersaline environment, with a reported  per cent salinity - flourishing into le. And a photojournalist with the Dead Sea Revival Project said that coming to the body of water, the lowest point on earth, you see prophecy coming true.  The third strange occurrence took place this week, when a snake was filmed slithering out of Israels Western Wall, unexpectedly interrupting prayers. Footage showed the reptile scaring away a pigeon - with some Internet users deeming it a sign that a prophecy about the Messiahs coming will soon be fulfilled.While countless end of the world conspiracy theories have fallen flat over the decades, some claim that the beginning of the end will actually begin in .The trio of signs have all emerged in the past few months. Below are the happenings that have sparked prophecy fulfilment claims  Birth of first red heer in  yearsTwo months ago, it emerged that a red heer had been born in Israel.The Temple Institute announced the birth via YouTube, and said the calf and her mother would undergo extensive examination to determineshes blemish free. It said the red calf brings the promise of reinstating Biblical purity to the world. Red heers feature in end of times tales, with the birth and sacrice of the red cow said to precede the construction of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. In mainstream Orthodox Judaism, the rebuilding of the Temple will happen before the coming of the Jewish Messiah. The two previous temples have been destroyed.  The Temple Institute and other organisations have been established with the goal of building the Third Temple on Mount Moriah or the Temple Mount. However, some theologians believe the construction of the Third Temple is linked to Judgement Day or the end of times. After “extensive examination of the calf, rabbinical experts are said to have confirmed she is a “viable candidate for the Biblical red heer”. Breaking Israel News reported a board of rabbis veried she fulfilled the requirements of the prophecy - which says the cow must be red without blemish. Fish spotted in the Dead Sea It is said that the Dead Seas high salinity prevents fish from living in it.However, marine le has reportedly been spotted in the seas sinkholes.Scientists are said to have been shocked to discover the sinkholes rapidly filling up with fish and other forms of le that never used to be sighted.Israeli photojournalist Noam Bedein said the body of water is anything but dead, telling Breaking Israel News that it is the “eighth wonder of the world.”  He has reportedly seen fish in the sinkholes - and witnessed growing vegetation. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet who appears in the Old Testament, foresaw the Dead Sea flourishing into le in his end-of-times prophecy.According to Ezekiel : -, there shall be a very great multitude of fish. And Mr Bedein said: A place that was once cursed in Biblical times, now you can come here to the Dead Sea, explore the sinkholes and see fish where the water has receded – fulfilling prophecies from Ezekiel who talked about the land flourishing and blooming when the Jews .  Snake wriggles out of the Western Wall A snake was spotted crawling out of the stones of Israels Western Wall on Wednesday night, causing some panic among worshippers. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation released video footage of the reptile emerging from one of Judaisms holiest sites, the Times of Israel reports.During the incident, the snake reportedly scared away a pigeon - which some bloggers have claimed is a symbol that we are living in dangerous times.They say these times lead up to the coming of the Messiah.  Some Internet users have also drawn connections to the serpent that tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, according to the Bible.According to Ynet news site, the snake that slithered out of the walls stones was likely trying to fatten itself up for the winter months. The incident came just months after a -pound boulder dislodged and fell from the Western Wall, nearly crushing a female worshipper below."},{"url":null,"title":"how many exes you you","story":"News\"How many exes have you had you slut \" Dads remark to fiancée hours before she stabbed him to deathDavid Walsh, , was kned to death by his we-to-be Cathrina “Tina” Cahill, , just weeks after he proposed to her on New Years EveShareCommentsByAine HegartySophie Evans:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsDavid Walsh was stabbed to death by his fiancée, Cathrina “Tina” Cahill, in February last year\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad-of-four called his fianceacutee a slut and asked her about her exes hours before she stabbed him to death, court papers show. David Walsh, , made the remark to his we-to-be, Cathrina “Tina” Cahill, in Sydney, Australia, after a row broke out between them. He is said to have asked the -year-old Irishwoman: How many exes have you had you slut , prompting her to tell him to cop on. It was later that night that he was kned in the neck by Cahill - to whom he had been engaged for just weeks - at their home in the city. The papers reveal the defendant said Mr Walsh needed to be taught a lesson moments before she stabbed him, the Irish Mirror reports. The killing occurred shortly after Mr Walsh started attacking another man whom Cahill and their two female housemates had arrived back with after meeting him at a hotel, according to the papers.  Cahill has admitted killing Mr Walsh on the night of February  last year, only weeks after he popped the question on New Years Eve. She was originally charged with murder over the incident. However, prosecutors accepted her plea to the less serious charge of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. It was accepted the woman, from County Wexford, was suffering from PTSD as a result of the abusive and violent nature of her relationship. A -page statement of agreed facts submitted to New South Wales Supreme Court this week outlines the explosive events leading up to Cahill stabbing her fianceacute to death with a large-bladed kne. She told police who arrived at the scene: “I stabbed him”. But the next morning, she told cops “my mind has gone blank” and she couldn’t remember picking up the blade and killing the dad. The court document describes in detail how the night of the killing unfolded and how Friday after-work drinks descended into death. The couple started the night at popular Irish hang-out the Cock ‘N’ Bull bar in Bondi Junction with their friends Grace Keegan and Melissa Sinnott, later moving to the Doncaster Hotel. But a row broke out between Cahill and Mr Walsh after Ms Sinnott commented how attractive Tina’s ex-boyfriend was.  Mr Walsh became angry and started to aggravate Cahill, calling her a “bike”. She grew angry and told him to “f*** off”. Mr Walsh then asked her about her exes and called her a sl**, to which she replied: “Cop on Davey and don’t talk to me like that.” According to the document, Cahill went out for a cigarette and Mr Walsh followed her outside, where they continued to argue. When they came back inside, Mr Walsh was “annoyed and frustrated,” he got off his seat and said “f*** this” and stormed off. Cahill, Ms Sinnott and Ms Keegan followed him out. However, he refused to get in the car with them. The women headed back to their Padstow home at pm, changed clothes, locked the house and walked to the Padstow Park Hotel. At the hotel, they met a man called Matthew Hyde after he introduced himself and bought them a round of drinks. He joined them for the rest of the evening and told police he was “keen” on Ms Keegan. The court papers show Mr Walsh went to the Coach And Horses Hotel at Randwick at .pm, where he got into a fight with an Irishman. Security rushed over and separated the pair, before Mr Walsh was escorted from the hotel. The Irishman, Richard Lindsay, went to AE where he received four stitches to his face and four stitches to the back of his head.  Cahill and her friends, who were still at the Padstow Park Hotel, started to receive a number of calls and text messages from Mr Walsh. At .pm, Ms Keegan received text messages with three photos from the young man. They showed broken glass on the floor with blood. Cahill, Ms Sinnott, Ms Keegan and Mr Hyde left the pub shortly before midnight and headed for their house, according to the papers. When they arrived, the front door was smashed and there was a trail of blood leading from the hallway to the kitchen floor and sitting room. Mr Walsh was on the couch, with his wrist cut but not bleeding profusely. Mr Hyde asked him: “Hey mate, are you OK ” He said Mr Walsh’s eyes were open and he mumbled something. He left him on the couch and joined the women in the kitchen when suddenly Mr Walsh hit him from behind. He shouted: “Who the f*** are you ” and hit Mr Hyde several times to the face and head with closed fists. Mr Hyde said: “What the f***! What’s your problem ”. He fell to the floor and ended up on his back with Mr Walsh on top of him, according to the document. The construction worker then repeatedly punched him, grabbed him by the hair and tried to smash his head into the floor. He also bit his face, breaking the skin and causing him to bleed. One of the women managed to pull Mr Walsh off him.  Everyone was yelling, with Mr Hyde describing it as “chaos”. The court papers say Mr Walsh was irate, with his body language described as aggressive. Cahill was screaming out, “Stop it Davey, get off, get off. Cop on. He’s with Grace.” She tried to grab Mr Walsh’s arms and he swung his arm back, according to the document. She then fell to the ground. Cahill moved towards Mr Walsh and punched him in the face with a closed fist, before he pushed her again. Ms Keegan reportedly saw Mr Walsh try to punch Cahill in the face but didn’t knowhe hit her. Mr Hyde started shouting out: “What the f***! Hitting a girl!” Mr Walsh then started punching him again. Cahill got up, holding her head, and walked towards the kitchen. The papers say she was crying hysterically and was “all over the place”. Ms Keegan and Cahill shouted “call the police”. Ms Sinnott repeatedly told Cahill to “calm the f*** down, it is said. However, the defendant opened the cutlery drawer and took out a very large, sharp-bladed kne. Ms Sinnott told her over and over again “put it back.” This was said quietly so the others would not hear. She is said to have replied: “No, he needs to be taught a lesson, it’s not fair, look at poor Matthew.” Ms Sinnott went upstairs to call the police and locked herself in the bathroom. As she went upstairs, Mr Walsh released his grip on Mr Hyde and Ms Keegan pushed him up against the kitchen wall. Documents indicate Cahill than walked quickly towards Mr Walsh with the long-bladed kne “fixated on Davey”. She stabbed Mr Walsh in the neck, with the kne hitting him in the left side of his neck, causing a cm stab wound. Cahill did not say anything and pulled the kne out straight away and dropped it on the floor, according to the papers. The wound started to bleed profusely, with blood coming out of Mr Walsh’s mouth. Ms Keegan placed a tea towel on the wound and Mr Walsh shouted: “Call an ambulance, call an ambulance.” He stumbled away in a daze out of the front of the house. Ms Sinnott called an ambulance. When she came downstairs from the bathroom where she had locked herself, Cahill told her: “He’s gone mental Melissa. I can’t cope no more. I can’t believe what I just done.” She repeated: “What have I done. I’m so sorry.” When police arrived at the scene, they found Mr Walsh on the ground being held in the recovery position by Mr Hyde. Cahill was sobbing kneeling about two metres away from them. When they asked what had happened, she reportedly said: “They were fighting and he [Mr Walsh] grabbed a kne and came at him [Mr Hyde]. I stepped in to help and stabbed him [Mr Walsh]. I stabbed him.” Shortly after, police noted Mr Walsh had stopped breathing and started CPR. Paramedics soon arrived and attempted to save the dad, but he was pronounced dead at the scene at .am. When interviewed by police the next morning at am, Cahill told police she couldn’t remember anything about stabbing her fianceacute. She said: “My mind went blank. My mind has gone blank, the only thing I remember is sitting out the front shouting call the ambulance, please call the ambulance. And then sitting screaming, ‘Please, please save my baby’.” She told investigators her le had been hell with Mr Walsh for the past six months, he never stopped calling her names and she often wished she was not alive so she wouldn’t have to deal with him. Cahill will be sentenced next month.

Ideally the game at Kilmarnock will kick us on to a good run.“Our focus is now back on the league and trying to climb the table as much as we can, then all our focus will be on the cup final when that comes around.”Being outwith the top six is not the norm for the Reds under the guidance of boss Derek McInnes.This time last season, after  games the Dons were sitting in second place on  points, just three behind leaders Celtic.After  games Aberdeen now have  points.Shinnie, , reckons an injury crisis, which the Reds are moving out of, has been a mitigating factor in the inconsistent form.At one point eight players were out injured but the majority are now back and available.He said: “We have had a lot of injuries. At the start of the season it was the defenders out as we lost players like Scottand Tommie Hoban.“Then after the Celtic game we lost three or four front players so the team had to be changed throughout the season.“A lot of the boys are back now and the gaffer has a good pool to choose from. It is about carrying on momentum.”In the previous clash with Killie this season Dons defender Mikey Devlin was red carded after just four minutes. It was a blow Aberdeen did not recover from as they lost -.Shinnie said: “Kilmarnock were good against us up here albeit we were down to  men.“They took advantage of that really well. Kilmarnock have players who can hurt you so we will have to be on top of our gamewe are going to get the win.”Shinnie’s contract expires at the end of the season and he will be free to speak to any interested clubs when the winter transfer window opens on January .Aberdeen have tabled a deal that would make him one of the top earners at the club.On his future, Shinnie said: “I am just trying to focus on my football.

There is no provision for it to be simply opened. There’s a clear way we can resolve this matter through a iation and we’ve been pursuing that for a considerable period of time now.”When asked why the contractor was reluctant to make the changes to the contract, Mr Matheson said: “That’s a question which you will need to put to them.”Throughout the duration of the project, contractors have refused to comment directly to the press due to the “partnering nature” of the project, with all requests instead being put to the government agency Transport Scotland.When pressed on a definitive opening date, Mr Matheson said they couldn’t be “firm” about the time frame but said contractors believe the whole route could be open by December, adding that would “hopefully” be the case.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The pair have performed all over Scotland as well as being broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland’s Classics Unwrapped multiple times.The afternoon started with the couple’s typical Spanish repertoire, a warm ‘Les Filles de Cadix’ that brought Bizet’s ‘Carmen’ to mind. Following Seiber’s ‘Four French Folksongs’ the audience was treated to the accomplished Savolini playing two solo pieces – originally Schubert lieder # now arranged for guitar. Although he only had six strings on his guitar, Savolini was still able to capture the rippling of water under the melody. The first act was finished with a light contrast of Scots songs including ‘Dream Angus’ and was met with murmurs of agreement in the audience.The second act began with a piece by Marco Ramelli by the name of ‘Moon’. The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm.

The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

versatile Anne played Rosemary by Frank Bridge on piano next-quite beautully-this surely must have been a piece about the love of his le.Dick then brought out the bass clarinet and introduced his own

the saxophone and it was explained that it was invented by Adolf Sax and fully intended to be a very loud marching band instrument.Peqena Czarda by Pedro Iturralde showcased the saxophone wonderfully with its hints of Spanish Tango. Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that! Jumpinrsquo at the Woodside by Count Basie did indeed jump!The final treat of the evening was Henry Mancinirsquos Pink Panther.Dick wondered whether there was any need for him to work again after composing this particular piece.Next months concert is on Sunday, November  at . pm.

thousand nationalists from across Ireland have sent a joint letter to the Taoiseach urging him defend the rights of Irish citizens north of the border amid uncertainty caused by Brexit and Stormontrsquos political crisis.The letter to Leo Varadkar has been signed by actors, academics, professional athletes, entrepreneurs, lawyers, teachers, doctors and a range of other figures from within civic nationalism.The signatories include Republic of Ireland international footballer James McClean, actors Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin, film director Jim Sheridan and folk musicians Tommy Sands and Colm Sands.Two similar letters have been penned to the Taoiseach in the last  months, one from a number of nationalists based in Northern Ireland and one from nationalists residing south of the border.The latest, which was sent on Friday and published in the Irish News on Monday as a two-page advert, has the largest number of signatures and is an all-island endeavour.The letter welcomes Mr Varadkarrsquos pledge to defend the interests of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland through the Brexit process but blames the Stormont powersharing impasse, which has seen the region without devolved government for almost two years, for ldquodenying certain ldquorights to people north of the border.It highlights Democratic Unionist opposition to same sex marriage and an Irish Language Act as two key issues of concern.The letter adds: ldquoAs you know these rights are now taken for granted by citizens in other parts of these islands.ldquoThe British Conservative government has rendered itself unable to effect any progress on these rights issues due to its dependence on the DUP.Footballer James McClean is among the signatories ldquoBrexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guarantees.On Brexit, the letter raises concerns about access to free healthcare in EU countries a potential hike to the cost of attending university in the Irish Republic and the fact Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will no longer be represented in the European Parliament.The letter continues: ldquoThere is a very real potential that partition could be reinforced, and our country and our people further ided.ldquoThis is a source of grave concern to all of us.ldquoWe, as Irish citizens, urge you to adhere to your commitment that we would lsquonever again be left behind by an Irish Governmentrsquo and to redouble your efforts, and the efforts of your government, to ensure that our rights are protected.Plans for the latest letter were first reported last month by the Co Fermanagh-based newspaper, the Impartial Reporter, which interviewed Enniskillen born actor McMenamin about his rationale for signing it.The letter was sent to Leo Varadkar He told the paper he was concerned that the imposition of a hard border post-Brexit could spark violence.ldquoBrexit and a border causing violence is a possibility and one that should never be overlooked but Brexit and a border causing economic chaos is a fact and one that is being totally overlooked by the DUP, he said.ldquoIt wonrsquot make anyone more British, it will just make everyone poorer.Belfast lawyer Niall Murphy, who has been involved in compiling the letter, said every section of nationalist civic le was represented among the signatories.ldquoThat this letter is signed by over a thousand leaders from the nationalist community is a testament to an evolving earthquake in terms of an awakening of nationalist confidence, he said.ldquoThe , names are symbolic, the letter is not a petition, but a representative sample of the views of hundreds of thousands of people across the north and indeed across the entire island..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Taoiseach urged to defend Irish citizens in Northern Ireland over

But we wouldnrsquot want to exclude other people who are in need.More than  people from the local area applied for the homes before they had even been advertised, but Mr Robertson was keen to point out that the need for affordable housing was not desperate.ldquoI donrsquot think therersquos a desperate need but itrsquos an expanding local authority economy, he said.ldquoTo call it a desperate demand may be slightly overstating it. There are parts of the country where you could go where there is a desperate need for social housing.ldquoThere is social housing here and therersquos a responsible housing department and good housing associations and we are working very much as part of that mix. I donrsquot think anybody is talking about things being desperate.ldquoThere is a need and itrsquos being met in a controlled and effective way.Ward councillor Neil Gilbert was also present at the handing-over of the keys and told the Courier that the development was ldquoextremely important.He said: ldquoThis is hopefully a step to a lot more of these properties being provided. The level of rent that these facilities house is what East Lothian needs.ldquoThis is a step in the right direction but letrsquos hope itrsquos a springboard for a lot more.ldquoWe need as many affordable properties as we can. When I say affordable, I mean social-rent-affordable. The more we have of those the better."},{"url":null,"title":"last-ash-lagoons-at-levenhall-to-become-a-wildlife-haven","story":"The lagoons at Levenhall Links were used to dispose of ash produced by the coal-fired power station during its letime.The power station closed in  and work has been carried out to convert the ash lagoons into areas for people to enjoy as per the Musselburgh Agreement drawn up between the local authority of the time and South of Scotland Electricity Board in .The area was taken over by ScottishPower following privatisation in .A large part of the -hectare ash lagoons has already been restored and handed over to East Lothian Council and has become a rich habitat for wildle.This month the local authorityrsquos planning committee gave the go-ahead for work to continue on the two remaining lagoons before they are also handed over.The entire site is a Scottish Wildle Trust listed wildle site, is part of the Firth of Forth Site of Special Scientic Interest and considered an important roosting site for wading birds.The area attracts bird watchers from all over the country and played host to the RSPB Big Nature Festival in  and .Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, welcomed the final part of the restoration, which will see wetlands and roosting areas created, along with footpaths and bird hides on the site.He said: ldquoThe restoration of the lagoons has been a success story, built over a number of years.ldquoIt is a valuable open space in Musselburgh and it will be great to get it completed.ldquoThere is a huge ersity in wildle which the public can access right on their doorstep."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-ban-for-man-who-pulled-wheelie-round-roundabout","story":"Michael Lenk was driving a motorcycle when he accelerated aggressively, causing his front wheel to rise up as he travelled around the roundabout at Strawberry Corner, near Wallyford.Lenk, of Kirk Road, Aberlady, proceeded to travel round the roundabout while riding on one wheel during the incident on November  last year.The -year-old appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to the road offence.Sherf Gordon Liddle banned Lenk from driving for six months and fined him pound."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-revealed-for-another-250-houses-on-the-edge-of-haddington","story":"An exhibition took place on October  where Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Mactaggart  Mickel Homes outlined their proposals for a site west of Letham Mains, where work is already under way on more than  houses.The L-shaped scheme, which is off Pencaitland Road, would see about  homes created, with a quarter of them affordable, and would sit in the south-west corner of the Letham Mains plans.Paul Darling, from the townrsquos community council, was among more than  people who attended the event at the Maitlandfield House Hotel.He said: ldquoIrsquom not against them putting houses there ndash they are filling in the gap there.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

It will run from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via Port Seton and Prestonpans.ldquoOnce it gets to The Loan in Wallyford it will replace the Tesco T bus by going down Macbeth Moir Road and Pinkie Road, then into Tesco before continuing to Fort Kinnaird.We will evaluate passenger use after a few weeks and hope to be able to expand the route in the new year.ldquoWe also currently run two routes into Tesco, the  and , and, from October , the  will make that three routes which will give a pretty good coverage of the Musselburgh area to and from the store.Iain Clark, chairman of Musselburgh Area Partnership, said: ldquoThe area partnership has recently been presented with the findings of our lsquowhat matters to yoursquo questionnaire, which highlights a number of areas that would make a dference to the daily live of the senior members of our community.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

Bosses said restricting workers from the EU would even drive some firms out of business.Mr Manning, who is a professor of labour economics at the London School of Economics, insisted it is important hospitality competes for labour on the same basis as other sectors, and suggested its growth should be restricted.Speaking to Holyroodrsquos tourism committee, he argued most EU migration had been in lower-skilled jobs since .He said: ldquoMany of the jobs in hospitality would not be eligible under our proposals.ldquoThe hospitality sector has been fantastic in creating lots of jobs, and quantity of jobs, but itrsquos not been very good at creating quality jobs ndash  per cent of jobs in hospitality pay below average earnings.He added: ldquoIf we want to move towards a high wage, high productivity economy, hospitality as it runs at the moment ndash which pays really rather low wages ndash is not obviously a sector that you want to encourage in terms of growth.ldquoWhat our view is, is that since  they found it rather easy to grow. Our proposal is that growth should not be so easy in the future. Itrsquos about restricting growth, not sort of getting rid of what there is already.Mr Manning continued: ldquoIf you talk about what the sectors are that we want to grow as a share of employment in the UK, you would not be focusing on hospitality as one of those sectors.\"He said it was ldquonot obvious migration had contributed to making Scotland a high wage, high productivity economy.And he argued the hospitality industry needed ldquoa little bit of pressure to boost its productivity and provide better paid jobs. Making migration harder would be ldquoan appropriate nudge to go down that route, he said.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it was ldquoutterly incredible to hear Mr Manning belittle the jobs of those who work in the sector.She said: ldquoMr Manningrsquos comments on the quality of jobs in the hospitality sector are arrogant and dismissive of the great work we do.ldquoThe sector is incredibly dynamic and vibrant. We provide jobs in every region in Scotland and across the UK create pound billion in economic activity and pay pound billion in tax.She said Mr Manning is ldquois very welcome to contact us directly, so we can arrange for him to work a sht in a hospitality business, so he can experience first-hand the brilliant work that goes on in our vibrant sector.Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Tavish Scott said it was a ldquobizarre suggestion that restricting immigration would do anything other than devastate firms and hotels across the country.Meanwhile, SNP MSP Stuart McMillan said Mr Manningrsquos evidence to the committee ldquopersonies the Toriesrsquo view that they can do whatever they want to Scotland in order to placate the hard-line Brexiteers who hold their government to ransom.A VisitScotland spokesman said: ldquoTourism is more than a holiday experience but the heartbeat of the Scottish economy.ldquoWorth pound billion to Scotland, it touches every community, generating income, jobs and social change.ldquoWith more than , EU national workers ndash around % of employees ndash in the sector, they are a vital part of the tourism industry and their contribution should be celebrated rather than discouraged."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-branches-out-into-security-systems","story":"The former First Minister has linked up with Kirk Torrance in a new company, Mount Schiehallion Ltd, which says its work is ldquosecurity systems service activities.Mr Torrance, a respected former digital media expert at the SNP, made headlines in April after it emerged he met Cambridge Analytica on behalf of the party in .He said he dismissed the firm, which collapsed after a scandal about Facebook data, as ldquoa bunch of cowboys.Slainte Media Ltd, which makes Mr Salmondrsquos weekly Kremlin-TV show, and which he jointly owns with former MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, has a % stake in Mount Schiehallion Ltd, with Mr Torrance owning the rest.The company was set up in July by Mr Salmondrsquos Glasgow-based accountant, who has also handled the creation of his media companies.Mount Schiehallion has also registered a website, but this is currently inactive.Mr Torrance told The Herald: \"This refers to an exciting new product currently under development to safeguard peoples privacy when using the internet.\"When it is ready for release next yearwe look forward to helping protect folks from the Cambridge Analyticas of the world.\"Mr Salmond was contacted for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-appoints-first-woman-as-party-chair","story":"Former MP Kirsten Oswald takes on the business convener role, succeeding Derek Mackay MSP, after being nominated by Nicola Sturgeon.Shewill now be responsible for overseeing operational party matters and chairing the National Executive Committee and National Conference.Ms Oswald said:ldquoI am thrilled and honoured to be appointed business convener for the SNP at this crucial point in Scottish and UK politics.ldquoWith the UK Tory government hellbent on dragging our country off a job-destroying Brexit clf edge it is more vital than ever that Scotlandrsquos voice is heard.ldquoTo make that voice louder and more powerful it is vital that all of our members have every opportunity to have their say ndash and that enhanced member power will be my priority.ldquoThe SNPrsquos vision of hope and ambition ndash and our actions in government making Scotland fairer and ready to join Europersquos successful small, independent countries ndash is in stark contrast to the inward-looking doom, despair and chaos of Westminster.Bruce Crawford and Angus Robertson have previously held the position, which was created in .Finance Secretary Mr Mackay was in the role for the last seven years.He said: ldquoThe past seven years has been an incredible period of growth for the SNP.

It had its own castle. It was leased from the local king who once a year would turn up to collect his commission dressed in a kilt. Isatu Smith, the head of museums and relics in Sierra Leone, describes how the Scottish slavers even built their own golf course on the island and dressed their slave caddies in tartan so they could be reminded of home. \"They were serving Scottish masters, so they had to look the part,\" Smith says. \"We have a shared history. It is very important that the Scottish people know about this ndash whether they accept it or not is another question.\"This week, Scotland will finally learn of the horrors of Bunce Island and be confronted by its forgotten role in the slave trade. David Hayman, the Scottish actor and director, has produced a new two-part documentary which begins on Tuesday night. In it, Hayman, through interviews with experts like Smith, lays bare just how central a role Scotland played in the slave trade.The country was \"up to its armpits in slavery\", Hayman says, even though the nation has always presented itself not just as having little to do with the trade in human lives, but also a country which was a leading light when it came to abolition. It is a  history and one that Hayman is hell bent on correcting.Scottish slavers ran Bunce Island from  to . They imported ice from Europe to keep food and wine cool in larders and enjoyed strolls in a private garden just metres away from pens where hundreds of human beings were kept like cattle before making the deadly Atlantic crossing. An estimated  per cent of slaves died on the journey. Eric Graham, a maritime historian, says that the dead were thrown overboard every morning. \"All slave ships were followed by sharks,\" he says. \"There was a dinner every day for the sharks.\"The Atlantic slave trade saw goods from Britain ndash pots and pans, beads, alcohol, pipes, guns, knives, and cloth ndash traded for human beings in Africa. These slaves were then sold in America. The American cash was used to buy tobacco, sugar, cotton, rum and indigo which were then brought back to Britain. It was a trade that made merchants into millionaires.Scotland in the th century was built on slavery. The Merchant City in Glasgow would not exist without the money that poured into the coffers of tobacco lords and cotton kings ndash who now have city streets named after them. These men were made rich beyond their wildest dreams by the profits of slavery. For the human beings traded as slaves existence was a living hell. Rape, murder, torture, abuse, humiliation and degradation almost beyond imagination, were the stuff of daily le. At least  million slaves survived being shipped across the Atlantic ndash with around .m bought and sold by British slavers, among whom Scots stood out as the most efficient and enterprising.Celeste-Marie Bernier, professor of Black Studies at Edinburgh University, says: \"Slavery bleeds in every building, in every brick, in every town across Scotland.\"According to Hayman: \"Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade is a story of uncomfortable truths over how we see ourselves and perhaps that is why it has been forgotten. It challenges the notion that we are all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns. Scots were plantation owners, slave owners, merchant ship owners. The profits fired Scotlandrsquos industrial growth and in every city in our nation you will find civic buildings and private homes built from the profits of slavery ndash bricks drenched in blood.\"There is now a growing campaign to, as Hayman puts it, \"acknowledge our past\" with an apology and reparations. There is also a campaign to establish a museum to slavery in Scotland, and for memorials and plaques to go up across the country on statues, streets and homes linked to slavery ndash such as the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow which was once the mansion of tobacco lord William Cunningham, a man made rich on the backs of slaves in the Americas.Scotland: a canny wee nation when it comes to rememberingProfessor Sir Tom Devine, the nationrsquos leading historian, says the scale of Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade is \"truly mind boggling\". He believes historians have a \"sacred duty\" to tell the truth about it, just as they have with \"that other horror, the Holocaust\".Adebusola Debora Ramsay, of the Glasgow Slavery Legacy Tour which takes visitors around sites in the city linked to the trade, says that whenever the history of slavery is discussed in Scotland the nation appears to suffer from a \"collective amnesia\".Poet Jackie Kay, Scotlandrsquos Makar and a woman of Nigerian descent, once said: \"Scotland is a canny wee nation when it comes to remembering and forgetting. The plantation owner never wears a kilt and Glasgow does not readily admit its history in a way that other cities have done.\" Liverpool has built a museum to its role in the slave trade and Bristol is in the middle of a long debate over what to do about statues to wealthy slavers in the city.Dr Stephen Mullen, an historian and author of the book \"It Wisnae Us\" about Scotlandrsquos role, says Scots view slavery as a \"peculiarly English problem\", adding: \"Scots have got off the hook.\" Slavery trickled down into every part of Scottish le ndash from the docker who brought sugar into the city, to the grocer who sold it, and the families who bought it to sweeten their tea. One major export from Scotland to the Americas was \"slave cloth\" to make cheap clothes for Africans on plantations. Salted herring from the Highlands had its main market in the islands of the West Indies as food for slaves.The Jamaican-born scientist Sir Geoff Palmer, Professor Emeritus of Le Sciences at Heriot-Watt University, saysBannockburn is in the history books, then slavery should be there as well. Scottish academic Michael Morris, an expert in slavery at Liverpool John Moores University, adds: \"Scots like to promote themselves as part of the civilising mission of the British empire, so we glory iniduals like David Livingstone, and we would prefer to talk about our role in abolition rather than our role in chattel slavery.\"Chris Dolan, the Scottish playwright who wrote an acclaimed novel about the slave trade called Redlegs, believes \"we managed to forget about slavery for an awful long time. Now that we are waking up to the part we did play, it is very dficult for us as we have this mythology we tell ourselves that we are less racist people than other European nations, specically England. That is not true. Therefore to wake up and find we are involved in slavery as much as other parts of Europe is dficult.\"As David Alston, an historian who is now chair of the board of NHS Highland, sees it Scotlandrsquos own historic grievances hold us back when it comes to confronting the past ndash specically events such as the Highland Clearances. \"We want to tell ourselves a story that in the Highlands we were victims,\" he says, \"butyou want to portray yourself as a victim the last thing you want to do is be the victimiser.\"In Jamaica there are thousands of Campbells named after the Scots who owned their ancestorsOne need only look through the records of wealthy Scots to find clues which were always staring us in the face over our shameful past. Just look at the ledgers of Sir Robert Cunningham, a slave owner on St Kitts. In a record from  he lists his horses ndash Jack, Beauty, Trooper, Duke ndash and a few pages later, his slaves: Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Whisky, a blacksmith aged  and worth pound.One of the reasons that it has become easy to forget the past is that we helped destroy it. When Sierra Leone achieved its independence in the s, the departing British took all records of slavery with them.Joannes Caulker, an historic archivist in Freetown, says: \"We lost our history. They only let us know what they wanted us to know.\" Joe Alie, Professor of History at Sierra Leone University, is clear that his country is still paying the price of slavery. Millions of young men and women were taken away, robbing the country of human potential, and forced to slave for white masters. \"While we lost, they gained,\" Alie says. He speaks of an inferiority complex in nations subjected to slavery. \"We were dehumanised during the slave trade era ndash that is a lasting legacy.\"Hayman also journeyed to Jamaica with Graham Campbell, a well known figure in Glasgow with his rasta dreadlocks, and now an SNP councillor in the city. Speaking of the rape of African women by white masters he says that is what \"created people with Scottish names like me\".In the Jamaican phone book there are literally thousands of Campbells ndash page after page of them ndash all named after the plantation owner who once bought their ancestors. The book is also full of Mackenzies, Macleans, McLeods and McPhersons. Scotland and its trade in slaves shaped the modern island. \"I have this name because you were over there,\" says Campbell. \"I am the descendant of survivors.\"On Jamaica there stands a plantation once run by the Stirling Maxwell family, who owned Pollok House in Glasgow, now a national treasure. The plantation was called Hampden. It had more than  slaves. The national costume of Jamaica, the quadrille dress, is tartan. The St Andrewrsquos Cross is in the Jamaican flag. The dock in Jamaica where barely alive slaves were taken from ships before being washed, oiled, shaved and given rum so they would appear in good health for the slave market is called Farquharsonrsquos Wharf ndash it was run by Scots.Further south, in British Guyana, a run of coastal towns is testament to how entrenched Scots were in the slave trade there. The towns all have highland names ndash Belladrum, Cromarty, Dingwall, Dunrobin, Golspie, Inverness. The list goes on and on.A legacy in blood, bricks and mortar: Scotlandrsquos shrines to ill-gotten wealthBack across the sea in Ayrshire, the stately home of Auchincruive stands as a \"colossal shrine to ill gotten wealth\", says Hayman. The house was built by Richard Oswald, a merchant slave trader who was an investor in Bunce Island. Oswald owned four plantations in the Caribbean and left a fortune worth poundm.In Clarkston, on the outskirts of Glasgow, stands another National Trust of Scotland jewel, Greenbank Gardens, once owned by Robert Allason. He and his two brothers had the slave trade sown up. Goods would go from Robert in Glasgow to a brother in Africa to be exchanged for slaves, and then another brother with a plantation in Virginia would pick up the slaves and send tobacco back to Scotland. It was a money machine, with human lives oiling the engines.One of Scotlandrsquos most powerful slavers was John Gladstone of Leith ndash the father of William Gladstone who became one of Britainrsquos most famous prime ministers. When Britain finally abolished slavery in  slave owners received millions in compensation which they went on to invest in industries like banking, mills, mining, and railways. John Gladstone had  slaves for which he was paid a sum worth poundm in todayrsquos money.Jean Francois Manicom, curator of Liverpoolrsquos International Slavery Museum, tells a story of an anonymous donor from Edinburgh, who he describes as a Scottish superhero. Once every fortnight the donor posts a Scottish ten pound note to the museum with an apology on behalf of the nation. \"This is very symbolic,\" says Manicom, \"a very powerful story of reparation.\"Another Liverpool historian, Lawrence Westgaph, himself a descendant of slaves and slave traders, believes that the racism which blights the UK today has its roots in the slave trade. \"Racism comes down to the idea that some people are less human than others and slavery helped cody that. What I see today is that anti-black racism has its origins in the slave trade.rsquo\" Confronting the past, helps draw the poison.How does Scotland confront its past  Apology  Reparations  A memorial So how does Scotland deal with the dreadful legacy of slavery  Historian David Alston says, \"acknowledging the past is the first step ndash it is only after that can you get on to the questions of reparations\". Geoff Palmer says that what would repair the wrongs of the past is a \"country which is wealthier contributing to a country that helped make that wealth\".So apology and then some form of compensation are now coming front and centre among those thinking about how Scotlandrsquos deals with its past. Graham Campbell wants to see schools and colleges in Scotland and Jamaica link up through student exchanges, for business connections to be forged ndash real concrete steps that will help improve education and lives in Jamaica, a country still living with the effects of slavery nearly  years after abolition.For Hayman there is no going back and no hiding place. \"We rewrote history to make ourselves look the good guys for abolishing slavery while blaming everyone  ndash well now is the time for truth.\"He adds, \"I like to think I live in a modern Scotland that is open-minded, free-thinking, liberal, tolerant, warm and friendly. Scots are loved the world over, but less than five generations ago our ancestors helped create and sustain crimes against humanity on an industrial scale simply to get stinking rich. This is an uncomfortable truth, but hopefully we can now find the courage and dignity to say we are sorry.\"Slavery: Scotlandrsquos hidden shame begins at pm on BBC  on Tuesday, November "},{"url":null,"title":"slavery-museum-to-be-set-up-in-glasgow","story":"Council leader Susan Aitken said they were poised to make an announcement in the near future about a \"comprehensive piece of work\" that would be regarded as a \"brave thing to have undertaken.\"It is understood that the Gallery of Modern Art in the city has been named as a possible site for a new museum commemorating Scotlandrsquos role in the Slave Trade.Glasgow City Council supports the idea of a museum to slavery ndash although not a specic location. It is understood that the council is on the cusp of taking action.The campaign for Scotland to acknowledge its role in the slave trade will heat up this week as a new two-part documentary, Slavery: Scotlandrsquos Hidden Shame, begins on BBC  on Tuesday night.Campaigners want to see Scotland apologise for its role in the slave trade, and for there to be some form of reparations to counties such as Sierra Leone, from where many slaves were taken, and Jamaica where many captives were sent to work. Millions died as a result of the slave trade, and it is seen as one of the worst crimes against humanity in history.As well as a museum of slavery, campaigners want plaques erected at statues and on streets connected to slavery. Many streets in Glasgows city centre are named after businessmen involved in the slave trade.The ramping up of the campaign for some form of \"reparative justice\" from Scotland came as one of Jamaicarsquos leading voices, the journalist and broadcaster Earl Moxam, warned that Jamaica and other Caribbean nations would likely seek reparation from Scotland in the event of independence.Speaking in the new documentary, produced by actor and director David Hayman, Moxam said the Scottish Government ldquoought to be aware ... thatit were to go the route of independence then I would expect that Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean would make a direct appeal for reparations formally to Scotland, to the independent Scottish government.Graham Campbell, an SNP councillor in Glasgow who is descended from slaves in Jamaica, is one of the leading voices campaigning for Scotland to make amends for its past role, and for the establishment of a museum of slavery. He said the museum should be at GoMA given the buildingrsquos past links to the trade. \"That is the obvious place,\" he said, adding: \"The city must make a gesture.\"Campbell also raised the question of whether streets in Glasgow named after merchants involved in the slave trade should be renamed.Hayman said: \"The first thing we have to do is apologise. The Scottish Government can say as a nation that we are deeply sorry for the horror we created  years ago ndash there is nothing wrong in saying sorry.\"Hayman also suggested a statue or memorial to the victims of slavery should also erected in Glasgow. He also supports the idea of twinning towns and cities in Scotland with places in Africa and the Caribbean where Scots were involved in slavery.Zandra Yeaman of the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights , which is also campaigning for a museum of slavery, said there was a ldquogrowing recognition of the need to represent the realities of empire, colonialism, slavery and migration within mainstream heritage and history.She added that ldquocities like Liverpool, London and Bristol have found a way to address this through dedicated spaces ndash museums, archives and learning centres. We think itrsquos time Scotland had a space to fulfil this need.The campaign for Scotland to make amends for the past has gained added impetus following the decision by Glasgow University to publish a report into its own historic links to the slave trade. The university won praise for admitting it had ldquoreceived signicant financial support from people whose wealth at least in part derived from slavery in the th and th centuries.Equalities minister Christina McKelvie said the Scottish Government wants to ldquoconsider how we can reflect on Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade."},{"url":null,"title":"saving-aviemore-community-buyout-plan-for-cairngorm-mountain-resort","story":"In a race to prevent the resort ndash and the neighbouring town of Aviemore ndash collapsing into terminal decline, local people and politicians are mobilising.Scotlandrsquos largest and potentially most complex community buyout is being compiled in a bid to create a new, all-year-round attraction. The plans, by the Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust, include building a network of summer mountain bike trails, an Alpine bobsleigh-style coaster, an education centre, and a self-sufficient hydro electric scheme.But, most importantly, it is a way for the community to protect its livelihood amid mounting concerns over the future of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise-owned ski and snowboard resort, which has seen years of falling market share, and accusations of poor management and lack of investment.The resortrsquos prospects for this winter have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that the pound. million funicular railway, which transports visitors from car park to upper slopes, is out of action amid safety concerns for the structure.The funicular railwayrsquos foundations are being inspected by specialist engineers who are due to report on its future next month. However, by then the winter weather is expected to make signicant repair work unlikely until next spring.Concerns over the railwayrsquos future and the impact on snow sports enthusiasts who have already bought   season tickets follows the dismantling of the resortrsquos chairlts last autumn. That move sparked fury among snow sports enthusiasts and raised further questions over the management of the area at a time when rival centres appear to be flourishing.If it was to go ahead, a community buyout would dwarf other land-grab projects in terms of scale and potential financial implications.While numbers visiting Cairngorm for snow sports have fallen, with the resortrsquos market share sliding from . per cent in  to . per cent last year, a buoyant winter season of skiing and snowboarding is estimated to be worth pound million to the Speyside economy.Community buyout campaigners say questions over the funicular railway ndash essential for transporting learner skiers and snowboarders to upper levels ndash plus a surprise decision by the HIE-appointed resort operator, Cheshire-based Natural Retreats, to close its ski school operation for the season, has brought the future of the mountain to a crossroads.Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust director Mike Dearman said: ldquoThe operatorsrsquo announcement not to operate a ski school seems to say that they have no faith in their own ability to run skiing on the mountain.ldquoPeople are worried, but in some ways it has galvanised them. We believe therersquos a positive future for Cairngorm snow sports, and some relatively small investment could move it forwards.The buyout proposals suggest AGCT could take over ownership of the land and assets from HIE, and inherit the -year lease deal with Natural Retreats. The community trust would then work with the operator to seek fresh funding streams, allowing HIE to revert to its traditional role of supporting the business and sustainable development.It suggests an pound, investment in hydro-electric schemes at Coire Cas and Coire na Ciste which would provide an income stream plus power lts and snow-making equipment.A poundm snow factory would produce cover for lower slopes, while km of mountain bike trails and a year-round Alpine coaster ndash a winding track which would carry thrillseekers down the mountainside ndash would attract summer visitors, bringing much-needed investment and seasonal work.Drew Hendry, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said he would be ldquodelighteda community buyout were to proceed.ldquoThere needs to be a change, he said. ldquoNatural Retreats has lost the confidence of local people. Communication with the public has been awful. They have shown an inability to engage properly and there has been an unacceptable sequence of events from the closing of the ski school to a lack of information of the problems affecting the funicular.ldquoI would be delighted[the buyout] was brought forward in a desirable timescale. However, we need action now and the community proposal would take some time to get together.He added: ldquoIrsquove contacted [Rural Economy Secretary] Fergus Ewing, and I am asking HIE and Natural Retreats to get around the table to sort something out. We canrsquot go through another season where we have got skiers in other resorts and not coming to Cairngorm.Kate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said: ldquoThe situation with the funicular has brought things to a head and prompted a lot of concerns. The conversation over who runs the mountain has gone on for over two years. While there is a community proposal, itrsquos one thing saying the current operators are not good enough, and another to come up with an alternative.Campaigners anxious to secure the future of snow sports in the area believe the time is right for the buyout.Alan Brattey, of Aviemore Business Association, said: ldquoI have no doubt that the Cairngorm mountain business will come to local businesses and the AGCT to manage. The plans they have are substantial and will drive forward the need for radical change.Questions have been raised over whether the funicular railway can be repaired and,so, whether the repairs will enable the facility to run reliably for many years to come.Susan Smith, business development manager at HIE, defended the management of the snow sport facility.She said: ldquoItrsquos been hard for the operator in many ways because there was a signicant requirement initially to understand the mountain environment and business opportunity. Running a mountain business is tough and complex and requires signicant amount of resources to get it right. We understand the frustration of the community.Smith added that the issues affecting the funicular railway were not foreseen. ldquoThis came up under a routine inspection. Itrsquos a complex engineering structure and specialist bridge engineers need to look at it.ldquoHealth and safety is paramount."},{"url":null,"title":"from-scots-chamonix-to-community-on-its-knees-the-race-to-save-cairngorm-mountain-and-aviemore","story":"For hardy Scots skiers keen to feel the mountain breeze ndash evenit did sometimes result in being blown off course by gale-force winds or skiing blind through pea-soup fog, all roads led north on the A to Aviemore.Convoys of weekend skiers climbed the winding road through Rothiemurchus estate and past Loch Morlich skis which had been hired or serviced at the bustling Ski Shack in the town centre were strapped to roof racks and an apregraves ski session planned for the Cairngorm Hotel, Skiing Doo or the Red McGregor.They found runs capable of challenging experts and, in the Ptarmigan Bowl, a wide basin of soft snow and gentle slopes which, thanks to the introduction of the pound. million funicular railway in , meant beginners could find their ski legs while savouring the postcard scenery of the valley below.Today, however, storm clouds are gathering over the mountain and what was once Scotlandrsquos premier ski resort. Businesses and locals who rely on it for their livelihoods are asking serious questions over how the snow sport centre is operated and its ability to continue to attract winter tourists.Concern had been already mounting over a recent slump in skier and snowboarder numbers which have seen the resort slip behind its rivals.A controversial decision last year to dismantle the mothballed Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts enraged mountain enthusiasts who had already expressed doubts over mountain owner Highlands and Island Enterprise and Cairngorm Mountain operator Natural Retreatsrsquo investment plans.Now technical problems affecting the funicular ndash the only route up for non-skiers and beginners ndash mean it is almost certain not to run this winter.For experienced skiers and snowboarders who do make the journey to Cairngorm, it means they are likely to face long queues for the T-bar and poma tows. Itrsquos even bleaker for beginners, who will be left kicking their boots on lower slopes prone to poor snow cover, hoping new snow-making equipment can help.Itrsquos understood a routine inspection revealed issues with floating bearings on the track which help it cope with extreme mountain temperatures. However, specialist engineers have now been brought in to inspect the railwayrsquos foundations.With the engineersrsquo report not due until early next month and the bitter winter weather expected to curb any repair programme, Natural Retreats marked the day of the first snowfall to deliver bombshell news to more than  ski school workers that their services would not be required.They join staff at the Ptarmigan Restaurant at the top of the funicular who, with no railway to feed tourists uphill, had already been told to stand down at least until the winter season kicks in. That has fuelled concerns over the operatorrsquos commitment to the resort and sparked interest among local campaigners to press ahead with plans to mount a community buyout, to develop their own vision for its future.All of which is cold comfort for local businesses facing the prospect of a bleak winter.Naeela Shahzad of Aviemore Convenience Store on Grampian Road said: ldquoIf you donrsquot get tourists up in numbers, then yoursquore in trouble.ldquoItrsquos not just skiers who use the funicular railway, some people just go up for the view. They take the funicular railway, look around and then spend time in Aviemore.ldquoPeople come to Aviemore at Christmas because they want snow. They want to go up the hill to see the views and the only way they can do that is by train. There is real concern among businesses over what will happen.Already one of Aviemorersquos most familiar names in snowsports, the Ski Shack, has closed, citing the ldquosituation on Cairngorm for its demise.Meanwhile Colin Little, manager of Mamborsquos Cafeacute Bar in the centre of Aviemore, said concern has been fuelled by confusion.ldquoNo one seems to know whatrsquos going on. Therersquos a lot of concern that it will be a dficult season, he said. ldquoThere will be tows and uplt available so wersquore all trying to stay positive.According to local MSP Kate Forbes, the situation gripping the resort is ldquopotentially devastating.ldquoThe impact of this throughout the local economy is signicant. Itrsquos snow sports that brings people to Aviemore in the winter.ldquoTherersquos no question this situation has an enormous impact on not just local hospitality and transport sectors but on the wider economy too.ldquoTo be announcing in late autumn, on the first weekend of snow, that a ski school isnrsquot going to operate, is inexplicable.ldquoEnough is enough.But just why has the former jewel in the crown of Scottish snow sport fallen so dramatically on its face To trace Cairngormrsquos problems means rewinding time to , when Aviemorersquos status as a holiday destination was taking shape in the form of a clunky concrete centre featuring go-karts, ice rink, cinema and its showpiece attraction, Santa Claus Land.The mountainrsquos ski tows and chairlts were the envy of Scotlandrsquos other resorts ndash and, indeed, many continental ski areas ndash when the Scottish Office took the controversial decision to transfer Cairngorm Estate from the Forestry Commission to HIErsquos predecessor body, the Highlands and Islands Development Board.ldquoThatrsquos where the problems began, says Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland. ldquoBoth HIDB and HIE displayed flagrant incompetency in how they dealt with the mountain. They simply chewed up one site after another, starting with Lurchers Gully and then the funicular railway.ldquoThey were told the railway was the wrong option, and a modern chairlt was a better option. But they would not listen.As well as the current engineering issues, the railwayrsquos tracks are prone to being covered by drting snow requiring staff with shovels to clear them before the trains can run.But even before its construction there were deep concerns over whether it would provide an effective alternative to a chairlt or gondola structure, and over its impact on the stony plateau of the Cairngorm mass, the only place in western Europe where both arctic and alpine habitats thrive.Its lower slopes nurture eagles, pine marten, wild cats and merlin higher up are found dotterel, snow bunting and ptarmigan.The mountain and its surroundings are designated a Special Area of Conservation, and the funicular plans horried the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ndash yet their concerns were thrown out by the Court of Session.The White Lady chairlt was torn down amid claims that the railway would see a boom in skier numbers, bringing , to the hill each year. Many locals scoffed at those figures.English-based Natural Retreats, a leisure and travel business based around eco-lodges and cottages, was appointed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise four years ago to run the centre for a -year period.If the intention was to halt any potential decline, the plan quickly fell flat.ldquoWe will build the best Terrain Park in the world here, and my long-term goal is to host the summer and winter X Games at Cairngorm Mountain, said Matthew Spence, CEO at Natural Retreats, at the time.ldquoWe will nurture, develop and create future British Olympians at Cairngorm Mountain. These athletes will win gold medals at the Winter Olympics in  and the Summer Olympics in  ndash we want to bring a true sense of pride and place to one of Scotlandrsquos most incredible assets.That, points out Aviemore and Glenmore Trust spokesman Mike Dearman, hasnrsquot quite materialised.ldquoPeople have been frustrated, these new operators came in with great promises, and then not a lot happened.ldquoThey came out with a plan for a new day lodge but it wasnrsquot well received. As far as skiers and snowboarders are concerned, they want good uplt and less queues.ldquoThen they came up with a plan for a dry slope which again wasnrsquot well received. Therersquos real frustration that their promises have not been acted upon.With Aviemorersquos reputation as the Scotlandrsquos winter playground in shreds, focus is shting towards radical solutions ndash including calls toownership of the mountain from Highlands and Islands Enterprise back to its original Forestry Commission owners, or for a community buyout.That idea emerged after horried snow sport and mountain enthusiasts witnessed the surprise removal of the Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts. ldquoThat cost pound, even though they could have been refurbished for less, adds Dearman.The irony of that decision is now evident. A refurbishment of the Ciste chairlt could have offered a ready-made solution to the funicular railway problems.Alan Brattey of Aviemore Business Association and owner of Avonglen self-catering accommodation said: ldquoHIErsquos long-term strategy with Cairngorm Mountain has been found out to be completely flawed.ldquoThe focus was completely concentrated on the funicular railway to the detriment of the rest of the ski area that thatrsquos been found out.ldquoHaving invested more than poundm in the funicular railway they had the view they need to get as many bums on seats to justy the cost of running it. That has been to the detriment of the rest of the infrastructure.ldquoHIE suffers from enormous institutionalised arrogance ndash it doesnrsquot listen to anyone.Meanwhile Morris points out the financial implications. ldquoCairngorm is losing market share all the time and the government is going to have to respond.ldquoItrsquos probably going to take nothing less than another poundm to sort this out.WHAT THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS SAYDespite local fury and concern for the season ahead, no-one from Natural Retreats was available to talk about the issues. A company statement said: ldquoWe welcome the investment from HIE. This new snowmaking equipment at Cairngorm Mountain will go a long way to supporting the surface lts running out of the Day Lodge area and create a learner area meaning snowsports enthusiasts can come to our resort and enjoy skiing and snowboarding.ldquoThis is great news for beginners and families who love to come to CairnGorm Mountain.Meanwhile HIE head of business development, Susan Smith, said: ldquoItrsquos fair to say that therersquos the prospect of funicular not operating during winter, but we donrsquot know what the engineering report will say.ldquoBusiness support service is being offered by Business Gateway and a Highland Council marketing campaign led by Cairngorm Business Partnership is giving a very clear message that wersquore open for business.ldquoWe know therersquos huge frustration, but health and safety is paramount.BACKGROUNDThe small Speyside village had already been on the tourist radar for decades when the first hardy skiers arrived in Aviemore.The arrival of a Victorian railway in the late s brought the tiny community its first taste of just how lucrative the emerging tourism sector could be.For the first skiers, enjoying the crisp mountain snow meant trudging uphill with skis strapped to their backs. Scotlandrsquos first ski lt in Glencoe in , was a game-changer.On  December , Cairngormrsquos White Lady chairlt, the first mechanised uplt on Cairngorm mountain and reputed to be the worldrsquos first detachable chairlt, carried its first skiers on a chilly -minute journey to the top of the hill.Hatched by a group of friends from the Glasgow shipyards, all members of the Creaghdhu Mountaineering Club, it launched Aviemore as a winter sport hub.By the mid-s, Cairngormrsquos network of chairlt, poma and T-bar tows made it one of the worldrsquos most highly developed ski areas, and Aviemore an exciting holiday destination.Lord Allander, of the House of Fraser chain of department stores, poured millions into creating a Highland playground resort.Concrete buildings in the village centre were not particularly attractive by todayrsquos standards, but were ahead of their time combining accommodation, ice rink, go-karts, swimming and Scotlandrsquos first purpose-built retail park in a single location.A generation of Scottish children grew up fascinated by Santa Claus Land. Unveiled in the mid-Seventies, it offered funfair rides, meetings with local man George Swinney, whose feathery white beard and jovial nature sent little ones home convinced they had just delivered their Christmas list to the man himself.But by the late s, Santa Claus Land ndash by then a mismatch of inflatable Father Christmas, funfair rides, a model railway and a plastic dinosaur ndash seemed to sum up an area on its knees.Concerned that jobs were at risk and the area was on a downward slide, pound.m of European money was found to prop it up.At the heart of the rejuvenation plans was to replace the White Lady chairlt with a new funicular railway that would bring income to the mountain all year around.Now, as attention focuses on Aviemores future, it once again appears that the only way to go is up."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-plea-to-make-foodbanks-part-of-the-social-security-system","story":"Mark Frankland, of Dumfries-based First Base, which gives out  food parcels a year across Dumfries and Galloway, said: ldquoThere seems to be a complete determination never to treat foodbanks as part of the welfare state.

Butthey hadnrsquot been around, you might well have seen people starve.Mr Frankland, who recently gave evidence at Holyroodrsquos Social Security Committee, said with food and child poverty expected to spike over the next five years, the government should consider funding foodbanks. ldquoThat would let us put more items in a food parcels, such as fresh fruit and veg or vouchers for people who run out of power.ldquoIf what is on offer from the DWP isnrsquot enough to keep body and soul together, we are there to be considered, he said. ldquoI donrsquot think the system would be abused.

Peter Kelly, director of the Poverty Alliance, said: ldquoWe support foodbanks, I give to them myself all the time. But no matter how much foodbanks are needed they are not a sufficient response. If our response to poverty becomes less based on security and peoplersquos rights and more to do with charitable giving and donations, that is likely to be stigmatising.Polly Jones, project manager of Menu for Change, which argues for alternatives to emergency food aid, said: ldquoPeople running foodbanks do it out of the best intentions. They are trying to step up and help. But the idea that it should be pulled in as part of our universal social security system is the wrong approach.ldquoWe need to make social security systems work better and fix the holes in the safety net first.ldquoIf foodbanks worked, people wouldnrsquot go back again, but in fact the vast majority using foodbanks do , at least once.Mr Frankland also claimed people on low incomes were being hard-hit by price rises from major supermarkets, which he accused of quietly raising the price of some of their cheapest items.The shopping bill for First Base, which tops up donated food to ensure parcels are nutritionally balanced, has doubled in a year, he said, from pound a month to pound a month.While the charity has seen a ten percent increase in demand, the bulk of the cost has come from price rises on supermarketsrsquo value ranges, he said.ldquoIT seems to be standard policy to limit availability and raise prices in their value ranges. Tesco has got rid of many of its lsquovaluersquo products and replaced them with other brands, while value range longer le milk has disappeared from the shelves.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: DEERNESS STORES, DEERNESS, KW QW OFFERS OVER £, + S.A.V.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget. We have managed to do this without compulsory redundancies and at the same time have still invested in important projects across the Highlands ndash such as new schools, roads and free wi-fi.\"A major concern is the councilrsquos financial reserves which are at their \"lowest levels in recent history\" requiring immediate action.\"We were estimating a pound million overspend in quarter one ndash but our officers have been working extremely hard to reduce this and we are now predicting a more positive out-turn with an overspend of pound. million,\" Cllr Mackinnon said. \"This is not ideal, but moving in the right direction. We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions. She said: \"Our children face another winter in cold classrooms having to go out in all weathers to access already disgracefully inadequate facilities ndash itrsquos shameful.\"Let us know what YOU think.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors. As somebody who loves history, I think itrsquos brilliant they have brought the past to le in such a way that tourists choose to come.\"We have a rich heritage on the Black Isle, that is slowly being forgotten. From the church services at the natural amphitheatre at Ferintosh Burn to Hugh Millerrsquos hometown of Cromarty, there are stories galore. Now Kirkmichael Trust has put this on the map.\"A spokeswoman for the Port of Cromarty Firth in Invergordon, said: \"Wersquore delighted the work of Kirkmichaelrsquos volunteers has been recognised with an Angel Award.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am. Work is expected to be complete by late next month.Monday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All it needs, apparently, is for her Cabinet to signoff.That eventuality is, however, no certainty for despite the resignation of David Davis and Boris Johnson following the imposition of Theresa May’s Chequers Plan, there still appears to be a handful of Cabinet members who can remember what she committed to deliver in her Lancaster House and Florence speeches – and what they collectively stood for in their party manesto only last year.Those included two simple statements that the UK would leave the Single Market, and it would leave the Customs Union. No s, no buts, no caveats. Since her speeches and her now infamous general election campaign the Prime Minister has wriggled and squirmed to try and get out of those commitments so she can deliver what she will call a “deal” – no matter how much it will tie the country indefinitely into terms that would not have been acceptablethey had been offered before the referendum in . The key point here is that,given the authority, what the Prime Minister signs us up to will become a treaty under the Vienna convention making it nigh impossible to change.It is not just commentators such as this author who have been warning of this dficulty until we are blue in the face, we fortunately now have a more diligent Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, stating this obvious legal inconvenience to the Cabinet. This has been enough for even past supporters of the Prime Minister’s negotiations to recognise the severe limitations they would face in delivering trade deals or changing our own laws. “Taking back” control would become “giving away” control to Brussels – risking an irate electorate and unhappy party members.Central to being able to go back on her word but still carry her Cabinet, her party and eventually Parliament, has been three tactics that have become clearer as the months have passed. The first is to postpone any decisions when there is a strong likelihood of them going against her what is generally called “kicking the can down the road.” The purpose of this is not just to retain control of the decision-making process and its outcomebut more to reach a point whereby likely opponents have no alternative but to back her worthless proposals, as there is no longer time left to develop an alternative – unless “No Deal” is to be the outcome.Naturally, this plays directly into the EU’s negotiating hand it has every incentive to make no concessionsso it too will kick the can down the road and at best only concede presentational compromises, not real ones. From the UK’s perspective the only way to change anything of substance in the negotiating process can only come from either capitulating on aspects of principle – such as remaining inside the Single Market and Customs Union – or announcing the UK is walking away altogether from what have become one-sided negotiations to accept WTO terms of trade. Theresa May could do this and say she will reopen discussions once next year’s European elections have been held and there is a new commission to negotiate with – but instead she has chosen to betray the principles she spoke of and was elected on. That would give meaning to “no deal is better than a bad deal”, but she doesn’t believe it despite other countries such as the US and China having “no deal”.The second device has been to ide the Cabinet and keep many of its members in the dark, with little time to read detailed papers. It is perfectly sensible for Prime Ministers to have a Cabinet sub-committee or what is often called a “war cabinet” to provide focus on daily management before going to full Cabinet. On such a vital matter as Brexit it is nothing other than manipulation for Cabinet members to be briefed in small groups so nobody is sure what is actually happening. This is a breakdown in Cabinet government that suits too many – including the official opposition .Finally and most importantly, for it transcends everything, is Downing Street’s use of intentionally opaque and confusing language in what it presents to Cabinet members . Briefings are so devoid of real meaning that they require an opinion from the Attorney General to reveal how the UK could face huge obligations when Cabinet members are being briefed ly the terms are advantageous .It is because of these tactics of delay, ision and deflection that Cabinet members have now forced Theresa May to appoint the candid Attorney General to her Brexit War Cabinet. Without a briefing from him they will no longer vote things through.We already have a Chequers Plan – that is remaining in the Single Market by another name through adoption of a so-called “common rule book”. Now the latest proposal is for what can only be called Chequers-Minus, for it is being claimed as a great victory with the Prime Minister winning concessions that will keep the whole UK in the Customs Union. But wait, she saidwe would be leaving the Customs Union – why is it then an achievement to win concessions to stay in The latest new “deal” has no detail about an exit from any shadow Customs Union, suggesting it cannot have been agreed – which means it is worthless. Neither has the backstop been dropped, which means the EU can hold us within the proposed arrangement in perpetuity – thus rendering it worthless. The truth is no deal has been done.So precarious is Theresa May’s position that she cannot afford to encourage more resignations and precipitate a leadership challenge that would be successful. Nor can she take a faux deal to parliament that would be rejected by over fty Tory MPs that have now pledged in full public glare to oppose a Chequers-based deal. The alternative is to rely on Labour votes – a position that would surely make her tenure impossible. Far better then to stop kicking the can down the road and calling the EU’s bluff – it has a time limit too, and it’s time we used it.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824384.1541365051!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mcdonnell adds to confusion over stance on independence referendum","story":"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has added to the confusion over Scottish Labour#s stance on a second independence referendum, saying that a Labour government would #consider whatever proposals come from Scotland# on the issue.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard insisted that the party will include a commitment to refuse consent for a second independence referendum in its UK manesto, following comments from Jeremy Corbyn that he would “decide at the time” how to respond to a request from Nicola Sturgeon.Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr McDonnell said Labour had an “absolute commitment that at the minute we’re opposed to another referendum”.The shadow chancellor said: “It is a complete distraction. Let’s concentrate on fighting austerity.”But he added: “We’ll consider whatever proposals come from Scotland, of course. These are devolved issues that need to be discussed.”Following last week’s budget, Mr McDonnell defended the Scottish Labour leader taking a dferent stance on taxation, saying Mr Leonard had “quite rightfully” refused to raise the higher tax band in line with Westminster.The shadow chancellor has backed Philip Hammond’s Budget plans to raise the p higher income threshold to £,, saying it puts money in pockets.People in Scotland are taxed at  per cent on earnings above £, and Richard Leonard has said his party would not support raising that level.Mr McDonnell said: “Richard Leonard, quite rightfully because taxation is devolved, put forward the Scottish Labour Party proposals.“The intellectual basis is this – we all agree on the common principles of a fair taxation system. That has to reflect the demographic that we represent and also it has to reflect the devolved nature of our decision-making in our country at the moment.“The Scottish Labour Party has actually come forward with their tax proposals which are based upon fairness, based upon raising additional monies that will be put into public services.“That’s exactly the tax proposals and principles that we’re putting forward here.”People in Scotland earning over £, pay more tax than those in rest of the UK.Some people on lower wages north of the Border are taxed less.UK Labour’s position is to make the top % of earners pay more, Mr McDonnell said.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824342.1541361489!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch don t ban him from tv here s how to tackle arron banks","story":"Arron Banks# appearance on Marr should hasten his interview by the real experts writes Lesley RiddochAre the viewing public any the wiser about Arron Banks and the real source of the cash he donated to Leave.Eu, after yesterday’s grilling by Andrew Marr on BBC  Does the BBC’s political flagship emerge smelling of roses after giving airtime to a man under investigation by the National Crime Agencyafter the Electoral Commission decided there were reasonable grounds to suspect Banks was “not the true source” of his £million donation If the answer to either question is no, why did the Marr programme fan the flames, allow Banks to spread yet more mis-information, further bolster the  cult of personality in British politics and run the risk of interfering with the legal process Banks’ willingness to be interviewed live undoubtedly boosted viewing figures, and must have seemed like a bit of a coup for the programme. After all, the billionaire has tended to avoid scrutiny. He walked out of a Select Committee in June after more than two and half hours, saying he had a lunch appointment.The desire to leave was probably enhanced by the line of questioning. Banks was appearing before MPs after newspaper reports of repeated contacts with Russian officials during the referendum campaign, centring on a potential business deal involving six Russian gold mines. Banks told the MPs no money from his overseas business interests formed part of his political donations and he was “crystal clear” about the rules. “I pay a shed-load of tax, probably more than the entire committee put together,” he said, before discovering his ill-timed lunch appointment beckoned. But not before admitting he had “led people up the garden path” and used “alternative methods” to influence the Brexit vote.This pattern of denial, obfuscation and stunningrevelation was repeated on Sunday’s Marr programme where Banks denied that his firm Rock Services was just a “shell company” without sufficient funds to hand cash to Better for the Country , which ran Leave.EU. When Andrew Marr put this to him, Banks said the company has “all sorts of revenues” but wouldn’t detail them, saying merely “We insure half a million people. I know it’s complex for journalists to understand but … this is about … undermining Article  and the Brexit result.” And true to form, he bowed out with an astonishing googly, claiming he would now back Remainthe European referendum was re-run.“The corruption I have seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over …selling out [Brexit], means thatI had my time again I think we would have been better to probably remain and not unleash these demons.”Now, there’s no question this was interesting stuff, and since there is no arrest, warrant or summons the interview probably doesn’t offend English law under contempt of court. That however wasn’t the real question.Firstly, was Marr the right interviewer  Arron Banks used legal jargon and made hard-to-challenge assertions about business behaviour, which would have needed a skilled business journalist to pick apart. Indeed, maybe that’s why Banks’ PR company decided to “reveal all,” to Marr, handing over redacted and very partial company accounts. It would have been far more interestingthe veteran Scots interviewer had made way for investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who along with Scots-based Peter Geoghegan has done all the donkey-work uncovering the dark money links that lie behind the Brexit campaign. She writes for pressure group Opendemocracy and the Observer newspaper, and of course, to card-carrying Leave supporters, those connections inevitably sound fishy making it easy for Banks to insist the campaign against him is politically motivated.Indeed, it is a sad reflection on the state of British democracy, that the important civic job of investigating Arron Banks has been left to freelancers backed by an online crowdfunder. But this weekend OpenDemocracy published information supplied by whistleblowers from Banks’ insurance company, which suggested that he lied to MPs  failed to declare Brexit expenses. Banks refused to answer questions from Cadwalladr on Friday, prompting her to tweet just before Sunday’s Marr interview “I think he should be questioned. But #Marr is the outlet his PR has chosen.” In other words, a soft touch interview. Since very little emerged from the interview, she might be right.Secondly, and more damagingly, Banks was able to put his own account of proceedings on the same level as the Electoral Commission and the Select Committee – both of whom he accused of political bias. Jo Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project commented“How robust Andrew Marr’s questioning is – and he is a good interviewer – is completely beside the point. The interview is an invitation to viewers to choose between what the independent regulator has said and what Arron Banks says. That is a  and dangerous equivalence.”This indeed is the nub of the matter. The Brexit vote surged on the back of a deep-rooted suspicion of the professional classes by marginalised voters. In the opinion of many poor folk, self-important, well-paid upholders of the public good have done nothing to protect the average man and woman and everything to feather their own nests. That means there are two entirely separate audiences for Arron Banks extraordinary claims. For professionals it’s self-evidently outrageous that a billionaire can impugn the bona fides of the Electoral Commission.For folk stuck at the bottom of a society without social mobility, money, sympathy or hope of change, independent commission and government quangos are all the same - staffed by the same set of well heeled professionals – and are therefore fair game.This is the genie that jumps out of the box every time Arron Banks gets airtime. In truth though, the best way to lessen his corrosive impact on democracy is not to ban him from TV, but to ensure he’s up against truly expert interviewers, to change the composition of democracy quangos so they look less alien to working class voters, and to make sure nothing delays Banks’ next interview with the real experts - the National Crime Agency which has the ability to fully investigate his financial transactions in the Isle of Man. With any luck, that will get underway before the Brexit deal is signed, sealed and delivered andit undermines the result, Banks will have a lot more explaining to do. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824279.1541321426!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may strikes secret brexit deal over customs union","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May is hopeful of keeping Britain in a customs union and avoiding the need for a hard border in Northern Ireland after receiving #private concessions# from the European Union, according to reports.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8692154.1541176569!/image/image.jpg","title":"mid and east antrim residents asked for views on outdoor recreation","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is calling on residents to have their say on an outdoor recreation strategy for the area.The council wants as much response as possible from clubs, groups, and lovers of the great outdoors to take part in a public consultation as they draw up proposals that will see which natural assets can be used for the benefit of residents and attract visitors to our borough.With coastline, rivers, uplands and low lands, forests, parks and open spaces, Mid and East Antirm has some of the most fantastic natural assets just waiting to be developed.To get involved, come along to one of three public consultation events, which are being led by Outdoor Recreation NI.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"historical treasure trove revealed at clifton house","story":"THE BELFAST Charitable Society has uncovered a suitcase of letters and material from World War One while preparing for its autumn series of lectures. letters tell the story of Irish Pfficer Patrick Dixon’s le at the front during the war through correspondence with his parents in upper middle class Dublin.Paula Reynolds, CEO of the Belfast Charitable Society, said: “Our colleague and volunteer, Jim McFerran, has been tirelessly working his way through the Dixon family papers ensuring they are all documented and sorted appropriately.“When our Archive and Heritage Officer unearthed the letters we were astonished at first of all the amount of the material, as well as the condition of it.” Aaron McIntyre, Archive and Heritage Officer at Clton House, said: “These letters and material are of great importance and we are very excited about their signicance. It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time.

There was never any justication for violence. “Lofty speeches about ato the borders of the s and s are not based on fact and only serve to add succour to men of violence.”She added that placing any new barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain “would be catastrophic for our economy” after it was reported that Theresa May had secured a deal that will see the UK remain within a customs union with the EU.The Sunday Times claimed that preparations for a deal are more advanced than had been anticipated, with a detailed document in the works.Since Brexit talks began the EU has insisted on an agreement which would see Northern Ireland remain part of the customs union and the single market in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic in the event of no deal.Under the latest proposals, the EU would write a UK-wide backstop into the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement, meaning a backstop solely for Northern Ireland would not be needed.Responding to the report, Mrs Foster told the Belfast : “We are seeking an outcome that works for NI, the UK and the EU. “That would be a sensible deal.  “An outcome that effectively redraws the border and moves it to the Irish Sea is not sensible for the Northern Ireland economy or in a political sense, for the Union.“The Prime Minister knows that we have had one red line in this Brexit process. We will not tolerate the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK being undermined by any deal.”Mrs Foster said that “% of all goods leaving Belfast Port are destined for GB and % of goods coming into NI are from GB. To place any new barriers between NI and GB would be catastrophic for our economy”.“We are living through incredibly historic days. The decisions made in the next few weeks will dictate the kind of UK our grandchildren experience,” she continued.Mrs Fosteradded: “I am heartened by the support throughout the UK for our position. Unionists in England, Scotland and Wales recognise that placing a trade border between NI and GB would totally undermine the integrity of the UK single market.” Former Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire, appearing on Sky’s Ridge On Sunday, was askeda deal was close. He said negotiations are still very firmly continuing, adding: “We are % of the way there in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement. “Obviously still having this issue in relation to the insurance arrangements for Northern Ireland and Ireland, and that very much remains our focus and attention in getting that deal.”A Downing Street spokeswoman added: “The Prime Minister is clear we are leaving the customs union.“We are making good progress on the future relationship, and % of the Withdrawal Agreement has been settled. Negotiations are ongoing.”Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the article was written with a British audience in mind and such “running commentary” isn’t helpful.“The EU has been united through the Brexit process. The UK has given written commitments last December and March that the Withdrawal Agreement will give a legal guarantee of noto a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance — this is the backstop,” Mr Coveney said.“In March the UK agreed this backstop will apply ‘unless and until’ a close future relationship eliminates any need for border infrastructure or related checks and controls. “We want the EU and UK to get to negotiating that close future deal but the UK must first deliver on the commitments of leaving. “The EU support to Ireland has been and remains unwavering. The negotiators are working hard and a running commentary isn’t helpful. “However Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, Jean Claude Juncker and indeed Theresa May herself have all said there will not be a deal without a legal guarantee of no hard border in Ireland. “We hope a deal can be done but we’re not there yet.”The Sunday Times article also stated thatan all-UK customs arrangement is written into the Withdrawal Agreement, the backstop proposed by the EU, which treats Northern Ireland as dferent from the rest of the UK, will no longer be required. It also claimed Theresa May is on course to securing a Canada-style trade deal.A senior Whitehall source told the paper: “The PM will be able to say there’s no more backstop, we’ve got rid of that — success. There’s an exit mechanism — success. “And you’ve got Canada — success. The small print is that Ireland is f*****.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no answer to irish issue tony blair","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On that day I posted a blog on Eamonn Mallies website challenging both of you to sort out your dferences and to get back into Government..pushI have been encouraged by the response to the blog from right across Northern Ireland, the Republic and GB and I now want to personally challenge you to do the right thing, to show some of the courage that your predecessors demonstrated and end this stalemate.I have no interest in the blame game as I believe it to be disruptive and unproductive. The real issue keeping the DUP and Sinn Fein from sharing power is attitude. With the right attitude nothing is insurmountable.In my blog I cited an example of when I moved into a mixed area from a Loyalist housing estate. It was about two years after the bomb and the move was prompted by a desire for my daughter to get to know little Catholic girls.It worked as she became best friends with two sisters that lived across the street. One Eleventh Night as I was getting ready to go round the bonfires in my old area, their parents called over and invited me to a barbecue at their house. I accepted the invitation and called over before going round the fires.What happened next has stayed with me for a long time and has served as a reminder of the kind of Northern Ireland I want to live in. When I arrived at their house they had built a small bonfire in their back garden, just for me.There were no flags on this fire and no effigy to be burned. I sat around the fire, drinking beer and eating a burger. We talked about everything and anything as our kids laughed and played together in the garden. Later on as I stood watching another Irish Tricolour burn on another Loyalist bonfire I thought about what had just happened in my Catholic neighbours house and wondered why it couldnt be like that all the time.Thats the kind of Northern Ireland I voted for in  and its still the kind of Northern Ireland I want to be part of in . But I need you guys to make it happen and you canyou show genuine leadership instead of entrenched opposition.I want both of you to tell those of us who have to live together in this small place what does it mean to be a good neighbour in this society.What could you do for the other that would make them feel welcome and their culture and traditions valued  How much is good neighbourliness a factor in your thinking This is the challenge that I want you to meet - for me, for the people of the Shankill, the people of Greysteel and for people all over Northern Ireland.I challenge both of you to a live debate with me on the issue of being a good neighbour. There is no need to bring a facilitator in from amongst the great and the good, just a live televised interview with an ordinary guy who lost his we in a bomb.I want to hear you explain to the people of Northern Ireland what you are prepared to do to make this country work, in what way will you be a good neighbour. I dont need you to rehash the problems that you face as most of the country is weary with that debate. I need to see how youre going to fix it and when, and I think that will only start when we hear for ourselves that you accept each other as good neighbour."},{"url":null,"title":"james mcclean poppy decision stop pretending to be offended says sdlp leader eastwood","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ies at dferent times of the year and in response to dferent political climates.”Lead solicitor on the case, John McShane, of McCartan Turkington Breen , represented nine of the  police officers, for whom the Chief Constable George Hamilton is answerable, and two civilian staff claimants, for whom the Police Authority is answerable.He said: “The Chief Constable’s failure — and continued failure to date — to pay staff in accordance with the legal requirements resulted in the need for police and civilian staff to incur the cost of pursuing legal proceedings to seek redress for their lawful entitlement to be properly paid whilst on annual leave.”Mr McShane explained that PSNI holiday pay had been based on working basic contracted hours and hadn’t accounted for any additional hours required. A high profile case in Great Britain four years ago, however, had determined that pay whilst on annual leave should include an average of overtime and other allowances.“Cases were pursued here because the PSNI had not sought to comply with these legal obligations,” he said. “The cases also addressed to what extent arrears of these unlawful deductions of wages, backdated to , could be claimed.“In England and Wales, legislation was introduced to limit any arrears claim to two years. No such equivalent legislation was passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly.”Mr McShane pointed to Judge Kelly’s ruling that “a failure to provide the right to paidannual leave... is an extremely serious matter going to the heart of one of the fundamental rights of the European Union.”The employment judge added: “An employer is not allowed to sidestep or to avoid the rights guaranteed under a European community directive. In the present claims, the position has been clear to all parties since .“Overtime payments and allowances should have been included, on some basis within the calculation of holiday pay. “The present claims appear to highlight a situation where a clear entitlement under the Working Time Directive has been effectively ignored and avoided for a signicant period of time and continues to be avoided. It is particularly concerning that this has been done by a public authority.”Mark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, praised the ruling saying it “corrects a long-running disadvantage and delivers signicant back payments to officers”. “The Police Federation represented , officers at no cost to themselves,” he said. “A further  were engaged in a private action which they had to fund. The cost to the PFNI was over £,. “Legal counsel was shared with the other officers who pursued the private action.”Mr Lindsay said the ruling “will give officers what they are entitled to” and he called on government “to step in to meet the claim rather than allow it to become a burden on the existing financial allocation”.“The federation is aware of the financial implications of the ruling,” he added. “Paying what officers are due should not be allowed to adversely impact on the PSNI budget which is already under strain.”Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: “We are considering the findings of this legal judgment which is complex and signicant. We continue to be involved in the legal process and as such it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uvf tell irish government to tone down britbashing reports","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a range of other figures from within civic nationalism.The signatories include Republic of Ireland international footballer James McClean, actors Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin, film director Jim Sheridan and folk musicians Tommy Sands and Colm Sands.Two similar letters have been penned to the Taoiseach in the last  months, one from a number of nationalists based in Northern Ireland and one from nationalists residing south of the border.Brexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guaranteesLetterFacebookTwitterThe latest, which was sent on Friday and published in the Irish News on Monday as a two-page advert, has the largest number of signatures and is an all-island endeavour.The letter welcomes Mr Varadkar’s pledge to defend the interests of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland through the Brexit process but blames the Stormont powersharing impasse, which has seen the region without devolved government for almost two years, for “denying” certain “rights” to people north of the border.It highlights Democratic Unionist opposition to same sex marriage and an Irish Language Act as two key issues of concern.The letter adds: “As you know these rights are now taken for granted by citizens in other parts of these islands.“The British Conservative government has rendered itself unable to effect any progress on these rights issues due to its dependence on the DUP.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Footballer James McClean is among the signatories “Brexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guarantees.”On Brexit, the letter raises concerns about access to free healthcare in EU countries a potential hike to the cost of attending university in the Irish Republic and the fact Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will no longer be represented in the European Parliament.The letter continues: “There is a very real potential that partition could be reinforced, and our country and our people further ided.“This is a source of grave concern to all of us.“We, as Irish citizens, urge you to adhere to your commitment that we would ‘never again be left behind by an Irish Government’ and to redouble your efforts, and the efforts of your government, to ensure that our rights are protected.”Plans for the latest letter were first reported last month by the Co Fermanagh-based newspaper, the Impartial Reporter, which interviewed Enniskillen born actor McMenamin about his rationale for signing it.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The letter was sent to Leo Varadkar He told the paper he was concerned that the imposition of a hard border post-Brexit could spark violence.“Brexit and a border causing violence is a possibility and one that should never be overlooked but Brexit and a border causing economic chaos is a fact and one that is being totally overlooked by the DUP,” he said.“It won’t make anyone more British, it will just make everyone poorer.”Belfast lawyer Niall Murphy, who has been involved in compiling the letter, said every section of nationalist civic le was represented among the signatories.“That this letter is signed by over a thousand leaders from the nationalist community is a testament to an evolving earthquake in terms of an awakening of nationalist confidence,” he said.“The , names are symbolic, the letter is not a petition, but a representative sample of the views of hundreds of thousands of people across the north and indeed across the entire island.”"},{"url":null,"title":"foreign nationals to be allowed into armed forces without having lived in uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

He had spent time with his mother but when it came to being independent he failed. He just didnrsquot know how to eat fish. It took us about a week to show him how.After an initial assessment, each seal began their journey to rehabilitation receiving extensive medical care, to ensure infections were kept at bay and housed in hospital pen whilst learning how to eat fish.Once they reached about kg and could self-feed, they were moved to the outdoor pools where they learnt how to socialise with other seals.At this stage, all human contact was kept to a minimum to ensure a successful re-introduction to the sea.Two days before their release, the seals were discharged from the seal unit as they had successfully reached their target weight of over kg and were in good health, ready to take on adult le in the wild.Ms Robinson said that Knockinelder Cove provides a great area for the pupsrsquo first few hours to get used to having no walls as they swim.ldquoWe never release a seal on its own and through our weekly weigh-in, we can identy release lsquoteamsrsquo such as Loki, Freya and Juno being our first for this season, she added.Ahead of the release all seals are tagged on their rear flipper to help identy them.Over time this will be used to see how rehabbed seals influence the wild population through breeding.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Leo Varadkar He was responding to comments made by Mr Varadkar on Saturday, in which he claimed that Brexit is undermining  years of peace in Northern Ireland.Speaking on RTE Radio One’s Marian Finucane programme, the taoiseach said: “Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and it is fraying relationships between Britain and Ireland.“Anything that pulls the two communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship.”His comments came two days after Nobel peace prize winner and Conservative Lord Trimble accused Mr Varadkar’s government of “riding roughshod” over the  agreement.   UUP leader Robin Swann Responding to the Irish premier’s remarks, Mr Swann said: “The tone of the language coming from Leo Varadkar at the weekend is, at best, disappointing and, at worst, a deliberate attempt to heighten tensions. “His words and tone are in direct contradiction to the approach adopted by his own Foreign Minister Simon Coveney at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.“If not handled properly, Brexit could undermine relationships between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, but I certainly didn’t expect the prime minister of the Republic to be directly involved in attempting to enhance the deterioration of those relationships. His words have a direct impact in Northern Ireland and not in a positive sense. “Instead of grandstanding to a domestic audience with one eye on an Irish general election, the taoiseach should start listening and taking advice rather than attempting to put his spin on the negotiations.” Backing Lord Trimble’s comments, Mr Swann added: “Whenever a Nobel peace prize winner tells the taoiseach that his government is riding roughshod over the Belfast Agreement, perhaps it’s time he started listening instead of talking. Perhaps it’s time he started concentrating on getting a deal for the benefit of everyone.”Serious assault: Man suffers suspected broken leg Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Inside the bell are the remains of an iron ‘clapper’ which struck the side to make the bell sound, but as it has corroded the bell is now silent. The new display has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has also enabled a community engagement programme around the item of shared heritage to take place.Dr Greer Ramsey, curator of archaeology at National Museums NI, explained the bell’s signicance, saying: “Along with religious books and the hooked staff or crozier carried by a bishop, bells became potent symbols of the Christian faith and even feature on stone carvings from this period.“Many hand bells were reputed to have connections to early saints so it was common for people to believe bells like this had miraculous powers.”To mark the recent discovery and display of the Ballyclog bell, there will be a special event at the Ulster Museum on November .Entitled, ‘Early Christian Ireland: Hand Bells, High Crosses, Music and More’, a series of talks will look at le in early Christian Ireland, at the use of church hand bells and at the identity of a mysterious musical instrument.

has said the party is considering potentially running candidates in local elections in Northern Ireland.Brendan Howlin said he had written to SDLP leader Colum Eastwood last week seeking clarication about a possible merger between Fianna Fail and the SDLP.Fianna Fail, which is currently the main opposition party in the Irish Republic, is currently in talks with the SDLP and is expected to run a number of candidates in next years elections.Speaking at the culmination of the Labour Partys national conference Mr Howlin said he would like to hold discussions with members of the SDLP to see how they \"could construct a slate of candidates that would allow people who want to express Labour values to have the option of voting for Labour candidates\".Mr Howlin said his party had worked with the SDLP \"as comrades\" within the Party of European Socialists for decades.\"I think there are an awful lot of people in the SDLP who remain very loyal to Labour values,\" he said.\"Thats what brought them into the SDLP in the first instance and I dont think they should be abandoned to simply have to join Fianna Fail.\"In a bizarre set of events last month Fianna Fail had to insist it had not selected any candidates to stand despite a member of the partys ruling executive maintaining Sorcha McAnespy had been chosen as a candidate to run in next years local government poll.Flanked by frontbench Fianna Fail TD Eamon O Cuiv and party senator Mark Daly, Ms McAnespy was unveiled as a Fianna Fail \"candidate\".But on the same evening as she was being unveiled as a candidate at a meeting in Omagh the parliamentary party said it had not selected anyone to run for election.Ms McAnespy claims party leader Micheal Martin had personally told her she had been chosen as a candidate.In a speech to Labour party delegates in Dublin on Saturday night Mr Howlin said the Labour party would step in to ensure a \"pluralist option\" was available to voters in Northern Irelandthe merger between the SDLP and Fianna Fail went ahead.The Wexford TD said the Labour party wanted a \"New Ireland\" where everyone on the island of Ireland had a decent standard of

Military personnel, veterans and family members gathered at St Annes Cathedral for the Royal Irish Regiments annual service of remembrance. Pic by Matt Bohill, Pacemaker The Service of Choral Evensong, which featured music from The Band of The RIR, included an act of remembrance and laying of wreaths. It was attended by all ranks of the regiment and a number of veterans and bereaved families.Giving the address, the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, the Most Revd Dr Richard Clarke, said it was “a genuine privilege” to have been invited to preach at a service for a regiment with such “a distinguished history”.He spoke about human dignity in the context of remembrance and the reality of hope and peace through following and experiencing the presence of Jesus Christ.Taking his theme from the RIR’s regimental motto ‘Faugh a Ballagh’ , the Archbishop highlighted its resonance with swords being beaten into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks: “This was the honest hope of many who volunteered to fight in the First World War, that this was a war that would destroy war for all time.” “Clearing the way’, in biblical terms, is not simply about retaining our humanity even in the most terrible of circumstances, in the horrors, deprivations and torments of violence. It takes us further. It is also about clearing the way for a future that is better than what we wish to leave behind,” he said.He recalled how the war poet Wilfred Owen, who was killed in action  years ago to the day, affirmed humanity even in the midst of the war that would claim his le.“Owen’s most important contribution, not simply to poetry but to our understanding of war even one hundred years later, was his determination that humans should never lose their humanity, regardless of the dreadfulness of their circumstances, even in the mud and terror of war that he was experiencing at first-hand,” he continued.The Archbishop concluded: “‘Clear the way’ has of course a distinctive military meaning – removing whatever is obstructing an advance. But it has, as I have suggested, a spiritual dimension as well. Clearing from ourselves all that stands between us and the le that we could live, the le that allows us to reach our full potential, our full stature – as the Scriptures put it – as children of God.”Brexit: UUP ‘disappointment’ over Leo Varadkar’s tone Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

The Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary James Brokenshire, who was formerly Northern Ireland secretary, speaking to host Andrew Marr, during the BBC current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. Photo: Jeff Overs BBC PA Wire In a major intervention on the controversial backstop, amid reports that the government plans to keep Northern Ireland in aspects of the EU trade structures, Mr Davis said it was “pretty clear there is genuine and signicant concern regarding the implications of any fresh backstop text”.Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Davis said: “It was an unwise decision to accept the EU’s language on dealing with the Northern Ireland border. “I said so back then and I’m still concerned now. Downing Street officials misled ministers at the time. “The Democratic Unionist Party is rightly worried about the future of the Union and many Conservatives are too.Mr Davis said: “If the attorney-general has warned — as has been reported — that the UK will not know when the backstop would end and compared it to being stuck in Dante’s first circle of hell, then it’s time to put an end to this nonsense once and for all.”Mr Davis said: “We need the cards laid on the table so we can form a judgment.”The Conservative MP said that Tony Blair’s failure to publish his own government’s legal advice from its then attorney-general on the Iraq war meant that the Labour prime minister’s reputation “never recovered”.In other developments on Brexit yesterday, the former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said that negotiations were ongoing,amid reports that major concessions had been made by Brussels.The Sunday Times reported that the EU would allow the creation of a whole-UK customs union that would avoid the need for a Northern Ireland border “backstop” that has been at the heart of the impasse in negotiations.At the same time, it reported that the prime minister was on course to agree a future economic partnership that would leave open the possibility of Canada-style free trade deal sought by Brexiteers.Mr Brokenshire, appearing on television, was askeda deal was close, replying: “Well, we want to get that deal, we’re obviously working hard to see that that happens.“Negotiations are still very firmly continuing, and therefore we are % of the way there in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement.Brexit: UUP ‘disappointment’ over Leo Varadkar’s tone Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Obviously still having this issue in relation to the insurance arrangements for Northern Ireland and Ireland, and that very much remains our focus and attention in getting that deal.”A Downing Street spokeswoman added: “The prime minister is clear we are leaving the customs union.“We are making good progress on the future relationship, and % of the Withdrawal Agreement has been settled. “Negotiations are ongoing.”A spokesman for Ireland’s Tanaiste Simon Coveney said: “The UK has given written commitments last December and March that the Withdrawal Agreement will include a legal guarantee of noto a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance.“In March the UK agreed this backstop will apply ‘unless and until’ a close future relationship eliminates any need for border infrastructure or related checks and controls.“While we too hope the Northern Ireland backstop will never be required to be used, it will be required to be written down in legal text.“This has been committed to by the UK in order to have a Withdrawal Agreement. “We hope a deal can be done but we’re not there yet.”It came as more than  business leaders backed a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, warning that the UK faces “either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit” that would be bad for both firms and jobs.Waterstones chief executive James Daunt, ex-Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King, Lastminute founder Baroness Lane-Fox and Innocent Drinks co-founder Richard Reed were among signatories of a letter calling for a People’s Vote on leaving the European Union.The letter argues that both the government’s current plans for Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit, would leave the country worse off than they were being in the EUthe country left in March.Other people who put their name to the letter include Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria, the former Marks and Spencer chairman and ex-Labour peer Lord Myners, Alex Chesterman, the founder of the Zoopla property website, and Sir Simon Robertson, the ex-chairmanof Rolls-Royce.• Morning View: We need to see full legal implications of NI in single market Johnston

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

defend irish citizens in northern ireland over brexit","story":"The letter to Leo Varadkar has been signed by actors, academics, professional athletes, entrepreneurs, lawyers, teachers, doctors and a range of other figures from within civic nationalism.The signatories include Republic of Ireland international footballer James McClean, actors Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin, film director Jim Sheridan and folk musicians Tommy Sands and Colm Sands.Two similar letters have been penned to the Taoiseach in the last  months, one from a number of nationalists based in Northern Ireland and one from nationalists residing south of the border.The latest, which was sent on Friday and published in the Irish News on Monday as a two-page advert, has the largest number of signatures and is an all-island endeavour.The letter welcomes Mr Varadkarrsquos pledge to defend the interests of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland through the Brexit process but blames the Stormont powersharing impasse, which has seen the region without devolved government for almost two years, for ldquodenying certain ldquorights to people north of the border.It highlights Democratic Unionist opposition to same sex marriage and an Irish Language Act as two key issues of concern.The letter adds: ldquoAs you know these rights are now taken for granted by citizens in other parts of these islands.ldquoThe British Conservative government has rendered itself unable to effect any progress on these rights issues due to its dependence on the DUP.Footballer James McClean is among the signatories ldquoBrexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guarantees.On Brexit, the letter raises concerns about access to free healthcare in EU countries a potential hike to the cost of attending university in the Irish Republic and the fact Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will no longer be represented in the European Parliament.The letter continues: ldquoThere is a very real potential that partition could be reinforced, and our country and our people further ided.ldquoThis is a source of grave concern to all of us.ldquoWe, as Irish citizens, urge you to adhere to your commitment that we would lsquonever again be left behind by an Irish Governmentrsquo and to redouble your efforts, and the efforts of your government, to ensure that our rights are protected.Plans for the latest letter were first reported last month by the Co Fermanagh-based newspaper, the Impartial Reporter, which interviewed Enniskillen born actor McMenamin about his rationale for signing it.The letter was sent to Leo Varadkar He told the paper he was concerned that the imposition of a hard border post-Brexit could spark violence.ldquoBrexit and a border causing violence is a possibility and one that should never be overlooked but Brexit and a border causing economic chaos is a fact and one that is being totally overlooked by the DUP, he said.ldquoIt wonrsquot make anyone more British, it will just make everyone poorer.Belfast lawyer Niall Murphy, who has been involved in compiling the letter, said every section of nationalist civic le was represented among the signatories.ldquoThat this letter is signed by over a thousand leaders from the nationalist community is a testament to an evolving earthquake in terms of an awakening of nationalist confidence, he said.ldquoThe , names are symbolic, the letter is not a petition, but a representative sample of the views of hundreds of thousands of people across the north and indeed across the entire island..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Taoiseach urged to defend Irish citizens in Northern Ireland over Brexit article_url   content_id

The works involve the strengthening and resurfacing of a .km stretch of the road and hard shoulder along with associated ancillary works. The scheme which will improve the structure of the road is due for completion by December .Due to the nature of the works it will be necessary to operate a speed limit of mph and to prohibit overtaking on the road from its junction with U Mullaghbane Road to a point  metres North East of its Junction with the A Drumman Heights Roundabout. Traffic using the road during the works will be subject to a speed restriction and an overtaking restriction and traffic signs indicating the nature and extent of these restrictions will be in place during the works. The public is asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive, cycle or walk with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of the works. Local access for residents and businesses will be maintained at all times during the works.The Department has carefully programmed the works operations and traffic management arrangements in order to minimise any inconvenience to the public.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in .
