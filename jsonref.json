April. The Government was criticised for the Randox deal after it came to light that Tory MP Owen Paterson receives a six-figure salary from the firm to act as a consultant.Randox\u0027s tests can

US.But nearly 30,000 of the swabs had to be discarded because they took to long to arrive.Samples have to be tested within 72 hours of the test being taken, which means that any delay in their processing could leave people with symptoms unsure if they have the virus. In a statement, Randox said: \u0027As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batchsupplier of swabs. \u0027This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business which uses a different supplier of

and what could happen to jobs and house prices.\u0027Pablo Shah, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, added: \u0027Consumer credit dried up in the second quarter, with lenders\u0027 assessments of unsecured credit availability falling to their weakest ever level.\u0027With unemployment projected to spike as the furlough scheme is wound down, default rates are also expected to rise, suggesting we could be approaching a credit crunch towards the end of the year.\u0027The proportion of consumers defaulting on their loans, or becoming unable to pay back the debt, was already on the rise in the three months to May.And earlier this week, Treasury body, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), warned as many as 1.9m of the UK\u0027s 9.4m furloughed workers may not get their jobs back, raising the prospect of even more defaults.The gloomy outlook has deterred banks from handing out loans, as they attempt to bolster their own books in the face of the economic downturn.The picture was mirrored across corporate loans, where default rates are also rising.The OBR has predicted that 40 per cent of small companies who have taken emergency taxpayer-backed loans under the Government\u0027s Bounce Back scheme could end up defaulting.The default rate for other schemes, such as the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, is likely to be lower.But they will still leave banks with a chunk of bad debt sitting on their books.A report from lobby group The City UK and accountant EY has suggested the Government set up a UK Recovery Corporation to help prevent toxic debt from holding back the country\u0027s economic recovery.Businesses which took emergency loans, but become unable to pay them back, could apply to be part of the corporation, the report said.Depending on their size and prospects, they could then either repay the loan more slowly as a tax on their profits, or have the government-backed debt converted into special financial instruments such as preference shares. Fast-growing businesses, meanwhile, could take investment from a scaled-up national growth fund.The City UK, which has been consulting on its proposals with the Treasury and the Bank of England, thinks that 3m jobs could be lost as a result of unsustainable business debt if no steps are taken.

By now it’s likely you’ve been out to visit a park or garden space with your family and friends. And, as the UK continues to reopen the doors and gates of its National Trust properties and other spaces to visitors, you may assume it’s easier to control crowds and distancing when you have plenty of room and it’s all outdoors.But there are myriad challenges for these venues – from “pinch points” on the grounds of stately homes, to animal interaction at wildlife parks.For visitors, checking that places and areas are safe to visit before embarking on a trip (visitbritainknow-before-you-go) is a must-do. While introducing measures and restrictions such as ticketed entry, limited visitor numbers, relocating gift shopsto larger rooms and increasing the sanitisation around the venue in areas such as toilets and food outlets has been key for managers at properties across the UK.‘The approach is to inform before arrival as much as possible’Andrew BruceWootton, CEO, Atholl EstatesReopening an estate with gardens may seem an easier prospect than, say, an indoor venue, but there was still plenty to consider for Atholl Estates chief executive Andrew BruceWootton and his team at Blair Castle and Gardens. Measures have included relocating the shop and a highly increased sanitising regime.“The approach is to inform before arrival as much as possible different people will be in different circumstances,” he says. “Because we are a large venue, people will often want to sit down, so we’ll be cleaning benches every couple of hours, but if people want to bring disinfectant with them, then please do.“It’s about trying to keep the venue as normal as possible, and clear and unfettered, so you’re not arriving to a hall of mirrors and every turn you come to you’re confronted with another sign.”As the grounds cover a rather large area, with a 3.5-hectare walled garden, arboretum, open areas of grasslands and a deer park, BruceWootton says the attraction can accommodate a large number of visitors safely under the new guidelines. “We’ve moved our shop to the ballroom, again looking at how we can make the visitor experience as relaxed as possible given that shops are by nature rather confined spaces,” he adds.‘The wellbeing the garden gives is really important’Stuart Stanbridge, chief visitor experience officer, Erddig – National TrustIn Wales, the 18th-century house and gardens of Erddig have opened with pre-booking at a reduced capacity to control numbers.“What we were looking forward to and what I think has been proved is the fact that we’ve been able to really enjoy the space. What’s so special about National Trust places in general, and Erddig in particular, is that they’re a place where people can go and escape from whatever problems they’ve got. The feedback from visitors is that they’re pleased to be back here. Because it is very peaceful and close to large populations, that outdoors space, the wellbeing that it gives, is really important.”Head gardener Glyn Smith maintained the grounds and historic plant collections, while Stanbridge helped with tree maintenance and even the venue’s shire horses and donkeys.“I’ve helped to pleach the lime trees, I’ve really enjoyed it,” says Stanbridge. “We’ve got two shire horses and donkeys – I’ve been looking after those as well. It’s been beautiful. It’s always quiet on the estate, but during lockdown there hasn’t been the traffic and pollution, so it’s been peaceful.”For ZSL Whipsnade zoo chief operating officer Owen Craft, it wasn’t just about the staff and grounds – there were some very specific large animals (and small ones, too) to think about. The park has reopened in phases, of which they are now in the second of four.“Our proposition is about authenticity and adventure, with vast open spaces and large herds of animals from elephants to rhinos, lions, tigers and bears,” he says.“We have smaller immersive up-close experiences such as a butterfly house, so it’s a nice blend. The key thing when organising this was to control the numbers when coming in. And the best way of doing that is pre-booking, only with morning and afternoon slots to stagger flow.”But some areas of the zoo remain closed off. For humans to go near the primates, for instance, visitors would need PPE because primates are more susceptible to Covid-19 transmission.“On arrival and in and around the site, we’ve got 2-metre pawprints everywhere,” says Craft. “The queueing system starts from the car park. Anywhere you funnel into a smaller viewing area we have to control queues, so we have pawprints for those as well.”Each of the zoo’s first two phases of reopening was in line with UK government adviceand the next two stages will be as well. “Phase three is about indoor play,” adds Craft. “Certain experiences we’d look to bring back as well as looking at how we can do an indoor restaurant offering. Phase four is about our overnight accommodation lodges, they’re seasonal and not open at the minute. We have nine glamping pods up on the downs and we run that from March to October ... so we will reconvene those in 2021. But the core day-visitor experience is open and running.”Again, it’s about the wellbeing element of what the venue offers, he says. “As we’re easing out of lockdown, people want that connection with nature – and I think Whipsnade being reopened is not to be underestimated, really.”‘People have come back to a wilderness and they’re loving it’ Tammi Peek, partnerships manager, Mount Stewart – National TrustWith large manicured gardens and its own lake, Mount Stewart is a neoclassical home and National Trust property in County Down, Northern Ireland.For partnership manager Tammi Peek and the team, the focus so far has been on installing low-key signage and one-way systems, as well as setting up a pre-booking system. Above all, their aim is to ensure that people would feel safe bringing their loved ones.“The first challenge was to think through how we get people on site,” says Peek. “People tell us when and what time they’re coming. Members are free and non-members can pay online. We get a list and print that off each day and know the surname and arrival time. When they arrive, we give them a brief description of how the property is now working. And we’ve found that while at first there was frustration, because you can’t be spontaneous any more, once people arrive, they are loving the security of us knowing how many people are on site.”The venue has slowly increased daily visitors and reopened its tearoom. Being measured and cautious has helped, says Peek.“We’ve found people have respected each other’s space. On site, we’ve got one-way systems in operation, which we’ve tried to make as intuitive as possible.”The property now runs with what Peek describes as a “skeleton staff”, with 20 workers brought back from furlough, but not all on a full-time basis. “Lots of us are doing jobs we might not normally do, but our priority is get folk in,” she says. She adds that they’ve tried not to be “overly covid signposted”, but that visitors do want to know which routes around the property will help them best adhere to social distancing. And there have been some lovely surprises for return visitors, too.“They’ve come back to see a wilderness in some places and they’re loving seeing the long grass and the way the breeze goes through it and the increased numbers of butterflies.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Henri Kisielewski is the 2019 recipient of the Joan Wakelin bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyFado is Lisbon’s urban folk music, born in and around the brothels, alleyways and ​tascas ​of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. Fado is to Lisbon what the Blues are to the Delta. Written records trace it back to the early 19th century, though some argue it is much older, connecting it to oral traditions imported from across the Portuguese empire.At the heart of fado is ​saudade.​ This elusive word – apparently untranslatable from the original Portuguese – broadly refers to a sense of sorrow, of yearning, and a resigned desire for what once was. This is the underlying emotion of all fado and perhaps of Lisbon itself.Alfama is Lisbon’s oldest surviving neighbourhood: a maze of medieval and moorish architectures arranged in a patchwork of steep cobbled alleyways and red-clay roofs, rising up from the Tagus river. Once a close-knit fishing community, it is now the heart of Lisbon’s tourist industry.A decade ago, struggling to recover from a deep recession, Portugal’s government turned to tourism and opened the real-estate market to foreign speculation. Today, more then half of all accommodation in Alfama is destined for tourism and thousands of long-standing residents have been priced out of the city centre. One after another, the shops that catered to the local community closed to make way for tourist-facing businesses – many of which are “fado restaurants” – and now Alfama feels more like a theme park than a living neighbourhood. This touristification is affecting much of the city​.​ If things keep going the way they are, one journalist wrote in 2016, Lisbon will soon have to hire extras to play Portuguese people in its streets.In 2019, I spent a month in Lisbon exploring the complicated relationship between fado and tourism. On one hand, fado is often upheld as the essence of Lisbon, an incorruptible mainstay in a rapidly changing city. On the other, it is the main attraction for many of the city’s 4.5 million visitors and is increasingly commodified to meet this demand.A recurring feature in many fados is Lisbon itself, in particular what it used to be. In its long history, many forces have played a hand in altering the city and its social fabric, the destructive 1755 earthquake being a key example. Today’s aggressive touristification is another seismic event, the full impact of which is yet to be fully understood.In many cases, the allusions within fado’s poems refer to both a real and an imagined history, both a concrete remembrance and an imprecise, idealised version of the way things were. In fado, truth and fiction coexist, history and myth are tangled.There is a parallel between this ambiguous relationship to the city, past and present, and the experience of modern tourism. In ​Invisible Cities,​ Italo Calvino describes travellers visiting the fictional metropolis of Maurilia. They are invited to accompany their experience of the present with the help of old postcards that depict how Maurilia once was, the “postcard city” being key to appreciating the city as it now stands.Travellers​ arrive in a location hoping that it will live up to what they had imagined, and are quicker to see the postcard city than the place itself. Over time, the place changes to fit this imagined expectation. It’s paradoxical, wrote the mayor of Barcelona in 2014, but uncontrolled mass tourism ends up destroying the very things that made a city attractive to visitors in the first place.This is particularly obvious in Lisbon, where the sheer speed of change and lack of oversight have magnified the problem. Once the locals have left, once all the menus are in English and, when looking down the ancient, winding alleyways to the waterfront, one is more likely to see the hulking mass of a cruise ship than the water of the Tagus river, what remains is a longing for what has been lost – whether real or imagined. What remains is saudade​.In an anonymous back street, far from the tourist gaze, there is one establishment like no other: a small fado house in a former Italian restaurant where fadistas meet once their tourist-facing engagements are done with. It’s an institution in Lisbon’s underground scene, open from midnight to 6am, and not featured in any guidebooks. I have been asked not to name it for fear that a surge in popularity might affect its delicate ecosystem.Inside, old fado legends glance out from yellowed posters in crooked frames and black funereal shawls – traditionally worn by female fadistas – hang proudly among them like team scarves in a football clubhouse. Thick red curtains cover the windows and the blue formica floor tiles have turned a minty green from decades of bleach and wine.This is the home of​ fadovadio,​ where amateurs and professionals take turns interpreting the canon. It is not uncommon to see a performance by a taxi driver followed by a well-known fadista, and then a butcher’s wife. One regular performer is a respected professor of Medieval bureaucracy.Any mention of this place elicits amused disdain from the owners and staff of the more “respectable” fado houses f​adovadio ​is not serious, they will say.​ ​But it is known to them all and they, too, can be spotted here on occasion, drinking from the source.Manuelo is the master of ceremonies, a prickly and charismatic octogenarian who made a name for himself in fado circles in the mid-60s. Donna Lena, his Russian wife, is a striking blond of ferocious energy. She spends each night serving drinks, making food and tending to the guests’ every need. Donna Lena and her husband are the adoptive parents of Lisbon’s fado community. The story goes that she ran away from the Soviet ballet to marry him when on tour in Portugal. But, here too, myth and history are tangled.At 2am, the performances are about to begin and the air is thick with smoke and anticipation. Beyond the laughter and chatting, one can make out the gentle cacophony of string instruments being tuned.During each set, the fadista performs four or five pieces. Lulled by wine and the red-tinged darkness, the audience is gradually swept up by the music, taken on a hazy voyage that evokes homesick sailors, despairing lovers and death. Some rest their heads in their hands, others stare wistfully into space. There is always at least one person who closes their eyes and falls into a deep sleep.One Saturday, around 5am, Marta Rosa appeared at the door with her small entourage. We had been introduced early in my stay and she proved invaluable in helping me navigate the intricacies of Lisbon fado.Donna Lena was tallying up the night’s damage for a customer with wine-stained lips. An old woman was handing Manuelo a framed picture of herself for the wall.Aside from the table of white-haired men arguing over a card game, the fadistas had the place to themselves. Marta joined the others in the back an L-shaped section of the room that is the domain of the performers.Five or six musicians and a handful of singers were sitting around the wonky tables that had, over the years, been demoted from the main room. By pivoting my chair I was now on the fringes of this new circle. I remember thinking it was a fitting place for me: neither a fadista nor a guest an interloper of sorts, a tourist who looks down on other tourists.There was a loud dissonant jumble, like a music lesson before the teacher arrives. Marta removed her coat and stood with her chin raised, her hands clasped tight in front of her. Then someone played the opening melody of Amália Rodrigues’ Ai Mouraria,​ and the cacophony fell silent. Donna Lena switched off the lights and accompaniment soon came from two sides as Marta began to sing.Her voice was soft to begin with. She floated through the high notes with a plaintive vibrato, squeezing emotion out of every drooping cadence. Then her song grew more forceful. By the end, it filled the whole room as she raised her chin higher, revealing the taught muscles in her neck.Almost as soon as the piece was over, amidst a few friendly heckles, a new one took off on another table. Poems succeeded each other in this frenzy into the early morning with different permutations, styles and rhythms, each singer owning the room in their own way. Occasionally, during a song, the words ​“O Fado” escaped someone’s mouth like a libation, in a voice both hushed and loud. This, I came to learn, was the signal that fado was happening.​Ricardo Ribeiro, one of the icons of modern fado, had explained it to me as a “manifestation”, a moment when everything comes together and all present share a sort of metaphysical communion. When the instruments disappear to leave only music, he had said, and the words disappear to leave only feeling, that is fado.On my last night in Lisbon, I walked down towards the centre of Alfama. I passed a wall near a shuttered restaurant where the words “Locals Welcome” had been thinly painted over and new grafitti had appeared: “Welcome Locals”.During my stay, I saw fado in cramped apartments and concert halls, street corners, ballrooms and sticky-floored taverns where tourists queued at the door. I visited evening classes in a suburb of tower blocks where a new sense of community has formed around fado. I attended a fundraising concert for a disabled girl where fado was the order of the day.The roots of fado run deep in Lisbon and that doesn’t seem likely to change. More than once I heard of the three F’s that make up the Portuguese spirit: Fado, Futebol, Fátima.Just as it survived the censorship and co-opting of the Salazar regime, fado’s essence will likely survive the effects of mass tourism. In fact, singing a more predictable version to tourists allows the majority of fadistas to live from their craft and in turn, allows “real” fado to survive.Trying to make sense of it all, I kept coming back to what Ricardo Ribeiro had said. He wasn’t interested in the distinction between “real” fado or tourist fado, commodification or authenticity only that once in a while, wherever it might be, fado h​appened.​Beside the church of Sao Miguel, the terraces of three restaurants share a sloping square around an old palm tree. In a doorway, a large woman was singing an epic fado about desire, loss and revenge, but her heart wasn’t in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc95c063480b5c40bbedcf0c447138888d605110/226_380_3003_1803/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c8db6717f4d05be83bf0e2789d631fa","title":"new horizons the living landscapes of don mccullin in pictures","story":"From the freezing Arctic and tombs ravaged by Isis to the beauty of his Somerset home, a new exhibition shows another side to the renowned war photographer Photographs: Don McCullin, courtesy of Hauser \u0026amp Wirth"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87891d7177e143a114c6fe505a7b9a09b2c4b00a/0_362_5464_3278/master/5464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06d01a4f2be6440c5d3a0f02c21db115","title":"a week of high swells in pictures","story":"As a large low-pressure system deepened over the Tasman Sea this week, large swells hit the east coast of Australia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe2a930ba05f08f45ab3316179dc8f243d1df4f/0_1104_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06c3dfce895e9a0f05136b9d87fdf920","title":"munroe bergdorf receives landmark book deal for trans manifesto","story":"Model and activist signs six-figure contract to publish Transitional, ‘a manifesto for how I see society changing for the better, bringing us all closer’The first book by Munroe Bergdorf, a manifesto on gender by the black transgender activist and model, has been bought for a six-figure sum after a bidding war between 11 publishers.Bergdorf’s Transitional will be published by Bloomsbury in 2021. Exploring six different facets of human experience – adolescence, sexuality, gender, relationships, identity and race – the book will draw on Bergdorf’s own experiences, including growing up in a mixed-race family, going to an all-boys school and starting her transition at the age of 24. In it, she will argue that transition is an experience every person faces in every phase in life, “and that only by recognising this can we understand times of change”.Bergdorf told the  that she envisaged the book as “a manifesto for how I see society changing for the better, bringing us all closer”. The trans experience, she said, is “thought of by a lot of people as this far-off idea that isn’t that relatable. I wanted to drive home the fact that we all transition in one way or another. None of us stays the same. We’re all on a journey, and a transition with regards to gender is just one of many we all experience as human beings.”The book will also take in current discussions around gender and sexuality, “because even though it looks like we’re living in a progressive society, how progressive is it when we’re still fighting against conversion therapy, and Boris Johnson is trying to wind back trans rights?” she said.The deal’s announcement comes after Black Lives Matter protests have forced a global reckoning on race, with the newly formed Black Writers’ Guild renewing calls for sweeping change in the overwhelmingly white UK publishing industry. But Bergdorf’s deal was actually struck last year, when she presented an 80,000-word proposal for the first time. It was an “incredible” feeling, she said, to have 11 publishers bidding to publish it, and she was “blown away” by Bloomsbury’s associate publisher Alexis Kirschbaum, who eventually acquired it in what the publisher said was likely to be the biggest book deal for a black, trans woman. Kirschbaum praised Bergdorf for having “a point of view that is exceptionally wise and humane, and the life experience to back it up”.As a model and an outspoken activist, who was hired and fired by L’Oréal in the space of a week in 2017 over comments she made in response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bergdorf said she felt that, until now, “my intelligence has been undermined, and I’ve been underestimated a lot in a lot of different instances”.“I’m looking forward to sharing a piece of work where people can actually read what I’m about firsthand, instead of seeing me when I pop up in the papers every now and again,” she said. “If I can change people’s minds about how they view people who aren’t like them, and how they view human difference, than that is a job done.”Gen Z, she said, “take a much more fluid approach to gender and sexuality … and I think that that’s where we need to go. We need to stop labeling ourselves with archaic definitions of humanity because we’re not simple. Humans are complex and you can’t label everything and you can’t label everybody else either. I feel like we need to widen how we see ourselves, and widen how we see each other, because then you realise that we all want the same thing.”Bergdorf has spoken out recently about fellow Bloomsbury author JK Rowling, whose recent comments about transgender rights Bergdorf described as transphobic. She also referred the UK peer Emma Nicholson to the Parliamentary Standards Conduct Commissioner, for her posts on social media about the trans community.“It’s such a shame, especially with these gender critical feminists like JK Rowling and Baroness Nicholson,” she said. “I think if they actually sat down with me and communicated in a respectful way instead of posting things about our community that are detrimental to the mental health, physical wellbeing and emotional wellbeing of trans people, they would see that trans people want what’s best for cisgender women, too. One group of society’s rights isn’t to the detriment of anybody else’s – equal rights are equal rights. It means equality, it doesn’t mean less for some, and more for others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d4bad20eb33a4ff632fdd5926e8312ae4d9bcf/0_263_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05715292a625f3f3fa70c52ee706c0fd","title":"british gas owner using covid 19 as smokescreen to alter staff contracts","story":"Trade unions accuse Centrica of forcing employees to accept worse conditions or lose their jobsTrade unions have accused the owner of British Gas of using the Covid-19 pandemic as a “smokescreen” to force its 20,000 employees to accept worse employment contracts – or lose their jobs.Centrica is in talks to “simplify” the wide range of employment contracts used across its 20,000-strong workforce, having announced plans last month to axe 5,000 jobs.But talks between Centrica’s management and trade union representatives have reached breaking point over so-called “fire and rehire” plans, which unions fear could erode the employment terms of thousands of workers.British Gas was forced to assure employees this week that the company would only seek to terminate existing contracts and offer fresh terms, known as a section 188 notice, as a “last resort” if the “challenging” talks with unions fell apart.Unions have accused the company of raising the possibility of a section 188 notice in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak to “blackmail” staff into agreeing to lower pay and tougher contract terms, following record losses at the company prior to the pandemic.Unite said the “smokescreen” was part of a “disturbing trend” among some of Britain’s biggest employers and called for Centrica’s management to undertake an “urgent rethink” of their plans.Referring to proposals by British Airways to change terms and conditions for thousands of staff under a section 188 notice, Mark Pettifer, the regional officer for Unite, said: “Centrica is adopting the same tactics as British Airways and is using Covid-19 as a smokescreen to cut jobs of loyal and dedicated staff who have worked through the lockdown providing energy to the nation.“Unite urges the Centrica management to have an urgent rethink and engage constructively with the trade unions to tackle the specific issues facing Centrica and, more generally, the UK energy sector post-Covid-19,” he said.Centrica crashed out of the FTSE 100 earlier this year after more than five years of decline, due to rising competition in the energy market from a string of low-cost energy supply start-ups.The owner of Britain’s biggest energy supplier has lost about 1 million customers in the last two years and reported a £1bn loss for 2019 before scrapping its shareholder idend and warning investors there would be a steep slump in revenues in 2020.The company’s share price has fallen to a tenth of its value in 2013, and its market value reached record lows in April just weeks after the company replaced its chairman and ousted its outgoing chief executive with immediate effect.Matthew Bateman, the managing director of British Gas, told employees via a video meeting this week that there was a possibility that the company may need to give notice to all employees that their current terms and conditions would be ended and new terms offered.Bateman added that the section 188 notice was “a normal legal step” which was “really, firmly our backstop position” to ensure that the talks with union representatives “don’t take too long”.“We know this is an emotive subject and we also know that it will cause further anxiety for our teams,” he said.A spokesperson for Centrica said: “We’ve been open about the changes we need to make to win back customers, grow our company and protect jobs in the long run. Our employees’ base pay and pensions will be protected but simplifying and modernising their terms is essential if we’re to become more flexible and price competitive.“We understand the impact this will have on colleagues and this is not an option we want to use but we must make these changes and we must conclude these talks before the winter period,” they added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce5c0104b3d9f09a0bcbc45d898819123000ce5e/0_343_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b60f6170a35076d27743b3765705d629","title":"dollar 11bn in imf covid 19 money being used to service debt says group private lendwers poorest nations","story":"Fund is accused of effectively bailing out private lenders to some of world’s poorest nationsThe International Monetary Fund has allowed some of the world’s poorest countries to use almost £9bn of Covid-19 bailout cash to pay private sector lenders in breach of its own rules, according to a leading anti-poverty campaign group.Hard-pressed countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia that went into the crisis with high levels of debt have used IMF funds intended for health budgets and food imports on loan interest payments, the Jubilee Debt Campaign said.In a report before a meeting of G20 finance ministers this weekend, the group said private lenders should be forced to reduce loan payments as the price of bailout funds to prevent poor countries from becoming caught in a cycle of debt.G20 finance ministers, including the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are to discuss at their online meeting how to reduce developing world debt and as a result increase the level of IMF support directed to vital services.Under its own rules, the IMF must refuse to lend funds to countries it believes have unsustainably high levels of debts unless private sector lenders agree to take a financial “haircut” that reduces the size of outstanding loans.Tim Jones, the head of policy at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said 28 countries at high risk of debt default had received $11.3bn (£8.9bn) that would be used to meet private sector debt commitments.He said IMF funding was effectively bailing out private lenders by enabling poor countries to maintain payments.The IMF said in many cases it avoided forcing recipient countries from defaulting on private debts because “in such circumstances it would only precipitate a sudden loss of access to much needed external funding and forestall the economic recovery”.Adding that the private sector is a vital source of funds, it said: “As the economy recovers and market conditions improve, repayments to the IMF are partly made from renewed inflows from private creditors.”Gerry Rice, its chief spokesman, said: “Without the IMF support, countries would often have cut back on other spending in order to continue to meet their external debt obligations, sometimes including to the private sector, which would have undermined their ability to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Our overriding objective right now is to save lives and livelihoods.”He said helping indebted countries deal with severe external payments problems was complicated. “It sometimes involves dealing with private sector obligations and without having the country fall into default, which would incur a host of other problems.”Tim Jones, the head of policy at Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: “We are not saying all IMF funds are paying off private sector debts, but some are. The IMF and G20 need to make private lenders restructure debts so that more public funds can save lives rather than pay private profit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1292e8f0b21670deb0825114f297e1395cb21174/0_272_5931_3559/master/5931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6bf1c82fa388864435169c3a6ee2577","title":"american unemployment 600 weekly boost","story":"Since March, unemployed Americans have received government money to pay rent and buy food – but if Congress can’t agree a new deal, what then?If Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have their way, roughly a week from now, the US will swap an imagined economic problem for a predictably devastating one, economists have warned.To keep people safe at home during the pandemic and to support them during the resulting jobs crisis, Congress in March instituted a $600 boost to weekly unemployment insurance benefits. Unless lawmakers step in, the money stops on 31 July.Republicans, as a result, have warned of hordes of people “disincentivized” from returning to work. But economists say the real crisis is what happens when those same people have $2,400 less each month to pay for bills, rent and groceries.Sara Gard has been furloughed since April from her hospitality job, and said without the $600, she and her two children will be entirely dependent on her husband’s pay.“It’s not going to cover everything, so what’s going to give? The house? The food?” Gard said.Once it is safe to return to work, Gard has a job she loves waiting at a company she admires and has been with for 15 years. But without the $600 boost, she will have to give up the furlough protections to take a new job near her home in Atlanta.“It is such a feeling of being caged and trapped, and every decision I can make is a bad one,” Gard said.Gard, 39, is her family’s breadwinner, and she said she would return to her job for less money if it meant she could continue collecting the $600. An added stress for Gard is that at the same time the $600 expires, she is scheduled to also lose state unemployment insurance because of caps on how long people can collect it.While the benefits deadlines loomed, Gard was also forced to decide by 10 July whether to send her two-year-old and five-year-old children to school or have them take classes online in the fall.She tries to compartmentalize the different issues, but said: “It just stops working at some point, because every possibility ends in: if only someone had done something four months ago, I wouldn’t have to be trying to decide if I give up my kindergartner as tribute or what? Or decide that I’m going to not work, but if I do that, do I lose my house? Everything is one domino touching another. It’s just awful.”The domino effect goes beyond Gard’s family. More than a million people have filed new unemployment claims each week for 16 weeks – women, particularly women of color, are bearing the brunt of the losses. When millions of families have less money to spend, it strains the country’s economy.Abruptly ending the expansion could cost 2 million jobs by the end of the year, economist Jason Furman warned a House committee in June. The Economic Policy Institute estimated 5 million jobs could be lost by July 2021 if it is cut.There is also a public health threat if people are forced to return to work in a pandemic which has killed more than 137,000 Americans because they can’t get by without unemployment benefits.For safety reasons, Samantha Acuna would like to be at home. She is instead working on-call shifts as a cocktail server at a casino pool in Las Vegas where customers are not required to wear masks.She lives with her parents and her mother has asthma, but people can’t turn down the job they had before the pandemic and still collect benefits, unless they meet specific guidelines.Acuna gets the $600 boost pro-rated to the days she doesn’t work, but if that money disappears, she’ll have to find a full-time job so she can continue to pay for rent, her car, student loans and phone bills.“The pandemic is just going to get worse if we don’t pay attention to it,” Acuna said. “So I would just rather keep that income so I could be home and this could all just finish quicker.”Democrats have introduced legislation that would extend the program, with limits. Republicans have said they are against the $600, but have not said what they would replace it with.Both parties have been on a two-week recess which ends on Friday – two weeks before the program’s official expiration on 31 July. For most people, however, payments actually stop a week earlier.The $600 expansion is far from perfect, but it is a welcome solution in a country with antiquated and underfunded unemployment systems, which have left millions without benefits months after filing claims. In Alabama, people slept overnight in a parking lot so they could speak with a representative from the state’s unemployment agency.Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the not-for-profit National Employment Law Project, said: “We’ve systemically gutted every other piece of the social safety net, unemployment insurance too.”Evermore said since the last recession, state governments have made benefits more difficult to access and reduced the amount of benefits. The Cares Act, which included the $600 expansion, papered over these problems.Without it, they are likely to come back in full force.“When systems are set up with the aim of catching people, trapping people, cutting off people, you can’t just turn that around overnight when you want to pay benefits quickly,” Evermore said.She said the persistent myth that people collect unemployment to take advantage of the system ignores how important the benefit is for the national economy. “This is a system that has been undermined for a while, and this is the moment we can use to put in place permanent reforms, now and forever,” said Evermore.In mid-March, Karen Kent was laid off from her job as a cafeteria worker in New Jersey. She has been looking for jobs because without the $600 she will have to find work. But so far, her searches have only turned up jobs with direct customer contact, something she can’t face because she has asthma and a heart condition.The $600 has been a “lifesaver” for Kent, 47. Her husband is still working, but it is not enough to support the family. He also lost a part-time job at a restaurant which he had so his family could get dental insurance.“This was starting to give me a foot back in the door to have hope, I felt like I was working towards something, and they just want to take it away,” Kent said. “I work hard. I am a workhorse.”Kent is a fighter. She corners politicians at public events and rallies people on social media, but she is concerned that the situation she and others face is not reaching the political class. Kent said: “I feel like they need the working class, but we’re getting beaten down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c8a0b3602e71a560c3167da7562eb4b8faa099/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9a984f4fc0d035c11ba07ae55f58d94","title":"cadbury to shrink size of wispa gold and double decker bars","story":"Decision, which also applies to Boost and Bournville Classic, will only affect multipack itemsCadbury is shrinking the size of Double Decker and Wispa Gold bars sold in multipacks so they contain less than 200 calories in an attempt to help tackle obesity, but the smaller bars will cost the same.Cadbury, owned by the US confectionery group Mondelēz International, said multipacks accounted for the biggest slice of its chocolate sales and the change would eliminate 10bn calories from the UK market in one fell swoop.The company said it was offering more portion control options by voluntarily committing to bring all Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks under 200 calories by the end of 2021.

However, there will be no change to the size of the bars sold inidually.A spokesperson for Cadbury said: “The list price for these products will not be changing at this time. Retail pricing remains at the retailer’s sole discretion.”The practice of reducing product sizes but maintaining prices effectively increases their cost per ounce and is known as “shrinkflation”.The confectionery group has already promised to reduce the serving size of treats typically bought for children to under 100 calories by the end of this year with Fudge, Curly Wurly and Chomp bars among those to have already made the switch.Louise Stigant, the UK managing director at Mondelēz International, said: “We recognise we must play our part in tackling obesity and are committed to doing so without compromising on consumer choice.

But the Frugal Four are also talking tough, with Dutch PM Mark Rutte insisting last week he’s ‘not made of marzipan’ (so won’t melt when the heat is on).The FT is also striking a cautious note, writing:Some warn that it will be a tall order for leaders to seal a deal this weekend, with some delegations preparing for a possible return to Brussels before the end of the month.“We are not there yet,” said an EU diplomat. “There are still bridges that need to be built”. Handshaking, back slapping and air kisses will all firmly discouraged at today’s EU summit, our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin reports:Any pre-summit bonhomie smoothing the way to a deal will be limited by social distancing. Leaders are being asked to wear masks on arrival and to avoid shaking hands – advice that appears to preclude the air kisses and backslapping that usually accompany the opening of summit talks.Gathering in the Europa headquarters of the European council, nicknamed the space egg, leaders will meet in a fifth-floor room designed to seat 330 people. This will ensure distancing for 30 leaders (27 national ones plus three from the EU institutions) and three or four senior EU officials.As well as a change to ventilation settings to eschew cheaper and more environmentally friendly recycled air, rooms will be cleaned during every break. Security, catering and cleaning staff and photographers will have to wear masks at all times.Special levers will be attached to toilet door handles to ease opening with an elbow. Each leader will get a sealed box of specially cleaned headphones to hear the interpreters. A doctor will be on site in case anyone starts to feel any coronavirus symptoms.She also predicts a tough meeting:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.No crisis is complete without a crunch European summit. And today, investors around the world are watching Brussels closely as EU leaders try to hammer out a €750bn recovery fund.The special two-day summit will see a classic clash between some of Europe’s ‘frugal’ Northern members, and the Southern states who have been hit harder by the pandemic (and were in weaker shape beforehand, following the eurozone debt crisis).The core of Brussels’ plan is a new ‘recovery and resilience facility’ of €560bn, to provide grants and loans to help countries recover from Covid-19.Crucially, Germany and France are both pushing for the EU to go to the markets to raise the money, backed by its common budget, and distributed towards regions and sectors that need it most after the pandemic. Italy, Spain and Greece could all head the queue for help.But Denmark, Sweden, Austria and The Netherlands have all pushed back -- they don’t fancy shared debt liability, and would favour a smaller package. They would also prefer the money to be doled out as loans, rather than grants.So, we can expect tough - but socially distanced - discussions among the bloc’s leaders, who will also try to agree a new seven-year budget (talks having collapsed back in February).Yesterday, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde tried to sound optimistic, telling reporters: “Our assumption... is that the recovery fund ... will come about and will be a strong mixture of grants on the one hand in larger proportion than loans on the other.”But the markets aren’t too hopeful of a breakthrough in the next couple of days.Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has warned clients not to get their hopes up:Our view here at DB is that although an agreement is still possible this weekend, it would now be a positive surprise, and there’s no indication so far of the differences of opinion between the member states having been bridged yet.The meeting gets started at 10:00 Brussels time, though is scheduled to continue into Saturday, so it’s likely the final news of what’s happened will only be known over the weekend. We are optimistic that an agreement on the European Recovery Fund can be reached. However, recently Hungarian PM Viktor Orban said negotiations will be “very tough” and will likely need to continue throughout the summer. But time is clearly running short, with Europe facing its worst recession in decades. A Summit failure could rock the markets next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b9cad4b6767820281c6a3ceb269278eb5d434d/0_0_3076_1868/master/3076.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=391bc8e4bff2d6f3760ce49aa7258bbe 645w","title":"ministers urged to overhaul early years services in england","story":"Children’s commissioner says whole pre-school sector needs reform as well as more fundingThe children’s commissioner for England has called for a complete overhaul of early years services, plus a government-funded rescue package to prevent mass closures of nurseries and childcare providers that could go under as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.The childcare sector has been hit hard by lockdown, with surveys suggesting as many as one in four nurseries and pre-schools could close within the year, rising to one in three in the deprived areas where children benefit most from early intervention.As well as an injection of emergency funding, commissioner Anne Longfield urged ministers to use the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity for a wholesale review of the sector and to make early years a central building block of a national recovery plan.“Nurseries and early years support play a vital role in helping children prepare for school,” said Longfield, “but coronavirus and lockdown have put many at risk of closure. The consequences could be thousands of children missing out on vital support that sets them on a path to a good education and better prospects.”Her report, Best Beginnings, acknowledges that successive governments have invested more in early years in England, but said the system is disjointed and often fails to target disadvantaged children in greatest need of early intervention, undermining their life chances.Among her recommendations, Longfield calls on the government to develop “a national infrastructure” of children and family hubs that provide a gateway to wraparound support services. The report also suggested a “family guarantee” of support for under-fives and their families to make sure all children have the help they need to be ready to start school, with more health visitors and increased funding for early help and troubled families services.It also recommends an expanded childcare offer of 30 hours universal free childcare and early education for all two, three and four-year-olds, and 15 free hours for all one-year-olds. “The government must make the early years a priority and drive reforms so that all children start school ready and able to learn and progress,” said Longfield.“Alongside high-quality early education, this means making sure that every family is guaranteed the support they need to help their young child to thrive, and to prevent early challenges turning into serious problems.”Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed the commissioner’s call for an emergency recovery package for the sector, as well as a wholesale review of early years, but urged caution on any extension of the childcare offer that could place more pressure on an already struggling sector.“For years, nurseries, pre-schools and childminders have faced a fight for survival as a result of wholly inadequate funding levels. With the coronavirus pandemic placing even more pressure on provider finances, the fact is that many settings simply won’t survive if the government doesn’t take urgent action.”Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, stressed the role of childcare in economic recovery. “Childcare is absolutely essential for working parents and to our economic recovery from coronavirus. But it has been ignored by the government in this crisis, with the early years sector consistently excluded from support packages.“We were already losing hundreds of nurseries and childminders every month before this crisis hit, due to years of underfunding. It’s time for ministers to get serious about supporting families in this pandemic and step in with a proper plan to save the childcare sector.”The Department for Education insisted the government had protected early years settings throughout the pandemic with significant financial and business support, including through the coronavirus job retention scheme.A spokesman added: “We are investing in early years organisations to help them boost disadvantaged children’s development, with grants targeted at improving outcomes for young children at risk of falling behind by age five, and for those with special educational needs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ee7187e855887e0baafe021393daf56ae88aa8/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0c3131ab1e12f6c336061e906502edf5","title":"share your photos from the big butterfly count 2020","story":"As the world’s biggest butterfly count gets underway once again, we’d like to see photos of what you’ve seenToday sees the start of the UK’s annual Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, which asks people to spend 15 minutes in an outdoor space and count the amount and type of butterflies, and some day-flying moths, they see.We’d like to hear about the butterflies that you spot too – and we’d also like to see photographs, if you’re lucky enough to capture them.

Now, the Clockwork Orange star is reconciled to a life of golf, gangster flicks and the odd glimpse of geniusMalcolm McDowell was the insolent prince of early-70s cinema, the Liverpool salesman who stormed the establishment’s barricades. You can see him on screen in Lindsay Anderson’s If…., kickstarting a bloody revolution inside an English public school. You can see him in Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, hanging with his droogs at the Korova milk-bar, making up his rassoodock what to do with the night. The sky was the limit. The world was his oyster. One felt he could achieve pretty much anything.If McDowell’s life was a movie, he would either have gone on to be crowned king or he would have exploded and vanished, ideally before he turned 30. But real life has a way of monkeying with the script, which may explain why McDowell is now a snowy-haired 77-year-old. He is a father of five, an avid golfer and a jobbing Hollywood actor specialising in baddies. His wild youth is behind him. He has made peace with his lot. “I had an incredible first few years,” he explains. “And of course that was the golden age. But you can’t keep playing the rebel for ever.”Every now and then he’ll land a peach of a part. Last year he played Rupert Murdoch in the #MeToo drama Bombshell. But his filmography also includes titles such as Abnormal Attraction and Death Race 2050, Kids vs Monsters and Meet the Small Potatoes. He has appeared in nearly 300 productions, many of which he forgot the instant he walked off the set. “People stop me and say: ‘Oh, we loved you in blah-blah’ and I say: ‘Sorry, that wasn’t me.’ And then they’ll show me on their phone or show me the DVD cover and sure enough, there I am.” He chuckles. “And I have no memory of doing it at all.”In his latest film, The Big Ugly, he plays a London gangster at large in the US, intent on laundering dirty money through the green hills of Appalachia. Billed below Vinnie Jones and above Ron Perlman, McDowell comes weaving through the action with a weaselly menace and a face like a clenched fist. It’s the sort of polished, dependable B-movie performance that must feel almost second nature by now.Happily, McDowell remembers The Big Ugly. They shot the film in Kentucky, deep in the boondocks at the height of summer. He recalls boarding at the Motel 6 and eating biscuits and grits at the local Cracker Barrel. “I had my 14-year-old son staying with me. He got so bored and it got so hot. That steamy southern heat that Tennessee Williams writes about. The only thing to do was drive to Walmart and walk around this big air-conditioned building to keep cool. That was the excitement. That was the big thing to look forward to. Breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then we’ll hit Walmart. After a week, he said: ‘You know what, Dad? I think I’d like to go home and see Mum.’”Just lately, of course, McDowell has been at home a lot, too. He lives with his third wife, Kelley, in a small town near LA but says the effects of the pandemic have largely passed him by. The main drag is that he was booked in to have his left knee replaced but the operation kept being cancelled it’s finally happening tomorrow. “I’ve been winging it for long enough,” he says. “Hobbling about, bone-on-bone.”He was a child of the aspirational postwar working-class. His dad ran a pub in Burscough in West Lancashire, the Bull and Dog. In his youth, McDowell worked at the Planters’ nut factory and as a coffee sales rep before alighting in London. He had a confident swagger and an air of dancing mischief. He went about life as though it were a game to be played, or a set of rules to be broken. “You’re a Brechtian actor,” Lindsay Anderson told him. “They know that you’re acting but the audience believes you anyway.”The collaboration with Anderson was like a marriage, he says. Spats, rows and make-ups. They made three fine films together, chasing the character of If….’s Mick Travis through the capitalist hunting grounds of O Lucky Man to the floundering society of Britannia Hospital. And it was thanks to If.… that he landed the role of Alex DeLarge in the vicious, playful A Clockwork Orange, prancing about Thamesmead in bovver boots and a bowler hat. “Fiftieth anniversary next year,” he says. “Where does the time go?”At the peak of his fame he starred in Caligula, a fevered Roman epic bankrolled by Penthouse magazine. The production sounds hilarious it was basically two films in one. First, McDowell played the mad emperor alongside a classy lineup of actors that included Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O’Toole. Then the producers brought in adult performers to shoot hardcore sex scenes to be deployed as extended cutaways, seemingly at random, so as to give the impression that McDowell was gazing wistfully at a lesbian orgy, or a gladiator getting a blowjob. “There’s quite a good movie in there somewhere,” he says. “But not the porn stuff.”McDowell’s imitation of Gielgud is perfect. He catches the man’s mellifluous delivery and querulous top note. “He’d say: ‘Oh, my accountant says I have to make cutbacks but I don’t see where I can.’ And I’d say, “Well, you’ve got a huge house, John.’ He’d say: ‘Oh yes, but I can’t sell that.’ ‘Well OK, but don’t you have a chauffeur-driven Rolls?’ ‘But, but – how do you think I’m going to get into London?’ ‘How about the train?’ ‘Oh, but I couldn’t do that. The train indeed!’ And I’d say” “Well, that’s why you’re having to do movies like this one, John.’”At the end of the decade, McDowell went to Hollywood to play the role of HG Wells in the film Time After Time. There he met the American actor Mary Steenburgen. The marriage eventually ended but by then he had put down roots. Looking back, he seems more nostalgic for his old London house than for the British film career he abandoned. “It was just off Church Street, near Notting Hill Gate, back of the Czech embassy. Painter’s studio. A unique building. I bought it in 1969 and sold it the first year that Blair got in. And my Aunt Vera lived there for longer than I did. I said: ‘You can stay here, Auntie, I’ll be back in three months.’ Then I went to Hollywood, met Mary, fell in love, had two children. Never went back.”England at the time felt too small, too parochial. Whereas the US was enormous, almost too big to handle. “I was out of my depth,” he admits. “So I played the heavy. The Brit. Which is sort of boring, but unfortunately that’s the way things worked out. When you move to a country like America, you’re a very small fish in a very big pond.”I’m interested to hear McDowell’s side of the story. Reading the cuttings, one gets a different take: the sense of an actor who somehow squandered his promise and let his audience down, possibly out of spite. The critic David Thomson refers to his “strange, thwarted career”. The biographer Roger Lewis describes his later years with an undisguised glee (“his pretty boy looks faded and he was condemned to playing villains in straight-to-video films that turn up on Channel 5”). It’s as though McDowell’s progress offends our collective sensibility. We hate to think of Peter Pan growing up to become a footsoldier in Neverland. The children of the revolution must never ever play golf.I ask whether he is as excited by acting as he was in his youth and he says that he is by and large, it depends on the part. “I still love it, otherwise I wouldn’t do it. Maybe in my forties I didn’t have a good time. People didn’t know what to do with me. I was a useful rebel in the 60s and 70s. But the Kubrick movie was overbearing. Everything was measured against A Clockwork Orange, which gets a little old. But that’s what happens when you work with giants.”Kubrick, in the end, was too controlling, “too brutal”, to properly bond with. But he adored Anderson and was great friends with Robert Altman. Those were his giants. Maybe there are others still out there. From time to time he will overhear his sons discussing new directors they love artists who seem to share the same bold and freewheeling style. “But I’m an old fossil these days. So I sit still and stay quiet.”Far be it for me to moonlight as his manager, but if he hears that there are exciting young film-makers hiding in the woods, why not seek them out? Better that, surely, than another third-billed slot as a photo-fit Mr Knuckles, another film he has forgotten as soon as it is put in the can.“No,” McDowell says, “I’m not going to seek them out. If they offer me something, I’ll do it. But do I want to go parading around actively looking for work? No. Because I don’t have the ambition to be above the title, doing this, that and the other. I really don’t care. I’ve had an amazing run, an incredible career, when you take it all into account.”Maybe this is the arc of most actors’ careers. Maybe it’s not just actors either. We start out looking for the biggest stage, the biggest challenge, the project with the potential to turn the world on its head. We finish up with a different set of requirements: a regular pay-cheque, some half-decent colleagues and a work trip somewhere warm, preferably near a golf course. McDowell – gifted, vibrant actor though he is – once said he would rather hit a home run than win an Academy Award. He tells me that this was partly meant as a joke but that actually he did hit a home run one time and it’s the most exhilarating thing, a feeling that lasts for ever.On top of that, he has never especially been a believer in prizes. It has always struck him as funny, the way the Academy lavishes acting Oscars on the movies with the best script and the best direction, the ones that are already so good that the actor barely makes any difference. The voters, he feels, are coming at it arse-backwards. Those aren’t the films where the real heavy lifting takes place.McDowell casts his mind back over his own long list of credits. The gangster flicks and the sci-fi knock-offs. The kids’ animations that few kids ever saw. He says: “I sometimes think: ‘My God, I’ve just acted in a real piece of shit and I managed to produce a credible performance. I managed to turn that piece of shit into something watchable.’ That’s what’s worthy of an acting award.”The Big Ugly is out on 24 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/705228443d00b72647e7a1be2e019a84d5220f66/291_68_2177_1306/master/2177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c353546a1dc289db9bd83a87dd0b8e4","title":"we have earned this solskjr relishes fate being in manchester uniteds hands","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær has urged his Manchester United side to embrace the challenge of qualifying for next season’s Champions League after a hard-fought victory over Crystal Palace.Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial took their combined tally for the season to 44 goals as they scored either side of half-time at Selhurst Park to ensure United remain behind fourth-placed Leicester on goal difference with two games to play following the earlier victory for Brendan Rodgers’s side against Sheffield United. United face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday at Wembley before rounding off their Premier League campaign at home to West Ham in midweek and travelling to the King Power Stadium on the final day.But having now gone 19 games unbeaten in all competitions to surge into contention for the top four – a run that stretches back until January – Solskjær admitted their destiny is now in his players’ hands.“We need to smile and go into this, we have earned this right,” he said. “No one thought in January that we would be in with a shout for top four. We have done fantastic since the restart. These are the games that matter. That is the thing at Manchester United, you have to step up and show your personality.”The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, questioned the decision not to award Wilfried Zaha a penalty after he appeared to be fouled by Victor Lindelöf just before Rashford opened the scoring, but Solskjær insisted the referee, Graham Scott, had made the correct call and praised his side’s resilience.“Today was about getting three points again,” he added. “We’re at that stage of the season where you don’t get extra points for how it looks.”Writing on Twitter, Parish compared the decision not to award Palace a penalty to a disallowed goal from Mamadou Sakho in last week’s loss to Aston Villa: “Is the VAR broken? Serious question. How can they look at Sakho ‘handball’ for minutes to make their ‘mind up’ and not even give that a glance! It’s a stonewall nailed on penalty even the most one eyed Man U fan knows it.”Jordan Ayew also had a goal disallowed for a marginal offside when United led 1-0 and Roy Hodgson admitted he is no fan of technology after Palace’s sixth straight defeat.“I’m still finding it hard to come to terms with it all,” he said. “It’s not helping my feelings during the game or after the game having to stand here and talk about these type of things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144a52b7a2218ae26ef8b7a4f2b8f762bcd92aca/0_0_2517_1512/master/2517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe8b8535b8184abcff9e2e72a2342ed","title":"coronavirus immigration pandemic new york glasgow","story":"I was used to living in a different country from my family. But the pandemic has made us realise we might not be together for some timeI miss my mother. She lives in Glasgow, and I live in New York City. Before our respective cities got locked down, this distance was business as usual for us. With a parent from either side of the Atlantic, I’ve always had family members living in both the US and the UK. But business as usual was when borders were open. Now, like millions of other people who live in different countries from their relatives, we’re trying to cope with the knowledge that we may not see each other for years.We’ve had the privilege of seeing immigration as a force for good in our families: for opportunity, adventure, variety. But now, we’re reconsidering our choices in ways that we’ve never imagined we would.Like so many of the personal sadnesses of the pandemic, it’s hard to reflect on this without acknowledging the good fortune we have in the grand scheme of things: we’ve stayed healthy, we’re not in danger of losing our homes. Many of us who are struggling with not being able to see our families in other countries are struggling because a huge luck that we’ve long taken for granted has disappeared. When we moved, or said goodbye to our relatives as they crossed borders, we did so under the assumption that we’d always be free to travel. We know that our particular pandemic predicament is far from the worst problem. But it’s still a big problem.For people who’ve always lived near their relatives, it might seem like my family isn’t close. I have two siblings, and at one point we were all living at least 3,000 miles away from our parents. But families like ours will recognize that our inclination towards distance is a kind of closeness in itself: by going away we were being unoriginal, following in the footsteps of our parents, who themselves both were immigrants when they were young. When you grow up with people who are out of place, sometimes there’s nothing more comfortable than being somewhere you feel foreign. My siblings and I had confidence to seek adventure in far-flung destinations because we knew that our parents had flourished when they migrated – and because we knew that we could always go home.I was sad when my mother moved back to Scotland after my father died, but I understood why she chose to. I’d just returned to the US after living abroad for many years, so I could relate to feeling pulled back to the country where you were born. When my mother left, I also understood that we’d visit. She was there when my son was born 19 months ago, just as my Scottish grandmother was present for my birth in New York in the early 1980s, taking her first flight at the age of 74. When I was growing up, return visits were rarer. It was a huge, expensive undertaking to get us all across the Atlantic in that era. My parents cut corners elsewhere in our lives to make it possible: experiencing another country and culture was a gift.I was happy to believe that my son would get to experience that, too. We had it so much easier: flying was less momentous. Phone calls were no longer special treats rationed for birthdays and holidays. There was always the next visit to look forward to.Until there wasn’t. It turns out that not being able to make any plan at all is the crux of the problem. It turns out that having plans were what kept us feeling hopeful, and close, and not filled with longing and terrible thoughts about the future that can’t be said. Why, we ask on our calls, did we do this to ourselves? Of course we know that many families are separated within countries, too, but still the possibility of domestic travel seems more promising. I can picture my family driving 1,000 miles to Florida to see my father-in-law, if that’s what it takes. It’s harder to imagine a world in which it will feel safe for my mum to get on a plane, much less one where the UK is welcoming to visitors from the global leader in Covid-19 cases.We were complacent: that’s the truth. My Jewish great-grandparents, refugees who emigrated to the United States from Russia and Lithuania, didn’t have a hope of ever seeing the family members that they left behind. Their children, my American grandparents, only spoke English: what was the point of learning languages useful in places that they’d never return to? The truth is that before the pandemic there were millions of families making the same excruciating decisions as my great-grandparents. Families like mine felt sorry for them, maybe campaigned for them, or donated money to organizations to help them. But we didn’t relate: to us, immigration was about fluidity, not permanent parting.Since the lockdown began I’ve FaceTimed my mum with my son most days: the bright side of being at home means that it’s easier to find mutually agreeable times to speak than it was when I used to go to the office. Now, my son knows who Granny is: we say her name and he points to my iPhone. We talk about what he’s been learning, and we talk about the weather, and we talk about politics – which government is worse today? Which leader most stupid and careless? We talk about a future in which we’ll be together again, but we don’t really talk about dates, or seasons, or years. My mother is doing OK, under the circumstances. Under the circumstances, so are we.

He says I’m getting taller, and the edge of his fingers tickle and tuck the tissue against the back of my neck. He asks whether my brother is starting to look at colleges, and sprays a soft cloak of mist that kisses my skin, gathers a small handful of wet blond hair and measures and tugs and snips and talks, but I am not listening to a word this man says. The jolt of clippers purring against my skull is electric. I smile and mumble softly: “Wow, I really needed a cut,” and he laughs. I pretend my eyes are sealed to keep them clear of loose hair, but I think we both know I might be somewhere else altogether.I first found touch in a barbershop in Michigan. Between the spray and chaos and chatter of other men. I mean this less in the sense of an introduction and more of an education, the way my mother says she never “heard” music until she encountered Stevie Wonder. Or my friend Alex says he had never “eaten food” until he went to Rome. When something grabs us in such a profound way, it startles us into ourselves, it raises the bar for how we wish to live, and when we’re lucky, it shows us who we are before we are even prepared to find out. Whatever the case, I “found” it first in the intimacy of another man’s hands, which, despite the blades they cradled, pulled the tenderness right out of me. Among the many gifts that queer kids inherit, few are more profound than the capacity to improvise. We waltz through our daily lives with the sensation that what we desire, and how we desire it, is best kept hidden from view. We pay attention to the private encounters that nudge us towards erotic communion, without the danger of sex. And years before I’d come out, before I’d let my body receive and pursue the kind of touch it craved, I thieved it. In Michael’s hands. The barber. The soft scrape of his clipping guard against my scalp. One careful shape-up at a time.As we lurch towards month five of life in a global pandemic, physical touch is all but forbidden. The intimacies we’re depriving ourselves of daily are far graver than the luxury of a haircut. And still, as unprecedented as this moment is, I feel an eerie familiarity, a preparedness – I recognise the challenge of improvising affection. Behind layers of cloth face masks, I nod and say thank you and good morning to strangers. In an ocean current of bike protesters, I sweat and pump my legs into rubber and shout the names of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and Tony McDade and Layleen Polanco and Rayshard Brooks, in concert, in chorus, in rageful communion. In the park after rainfall, I place my sneakers in the footprints of other runners. Hold doors with my elbows in the same spot another’s have been.And who knows what good any of this does, for none of these small thieveries are sufficient. But they do remind me of the hunger that has made me who I am. They remind me that I, like so many of us, possess the tenderness and fierceness to find new ways to show strangers I love them. To study and follow and listen and mind the small, healing gestures. To help us love us through, and to make ourselves again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324f54576ad5ce2a05e225320f1fc8cdd9381e9c/194_844_3445_2066/master/3445.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07686fc447d9e0a672e98c064ebcf613 720w","title":"family fortunes of wealthy increase as super rich ride coronavirus storm","story":"More than three-quarters of the world’s richest people have reported an increase in their already vast family fortunes, despite the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Research into the family offices of the super-rich found that the vast majority were able to “ride out 2020’s storm in financial markets”, while many less wealthy people have lost their jobs and seen the value of their savings and pensions collapse.Of the 121 family offices included in the survey, 93 had met or exceeded their financial targets in the year to May 2020. They achieved this despite most countries in the world suffering their worst economic contractions in decades. Some 24 of the family offices in the survey managed private fortunes of more than $3bn.Josef Stadler, head of UBS’s ultra-high net worth unit, said the world’s richest people had been able to increase their fortunes during the crisis because they had enough money to “embrace and manage risk like no other investor”.“They stick to their plans, even when market volatility makes it uncomfortable. They hold their position. They are disciplined,” Stadler said. “It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss.”The rising fortunes of the super-wealthy come as separate research shows that it is the poorest people in society who are mostly likely to be losing their jobs and suffering the biggest percentage fall in income.Ana Arendar, head of inequality campaigns at Oxfam, said: “Whilst those with great wealth are able to reallocate their investments to insulate themselves from the economic impacts of Covid-19, most poor people in developing and developed countries cannot take similar action to protect their limited wealth.“Wealth inequalities were already too high before the crisis and action is needed to ensure the gap does not grow further.”Family offices – which were pioneered by the Rockerfeller family in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations – are also used by wealthy people to run homes and staff across the world and to look after private jets, super-yachts and other accoutrements.The number of super-rich people continues to grow despite the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person and the founder of Amazon, has seen his fortune swell by $75bn so far this year to a record $189bn.More than 500,000 people in the world are classed as “ultra-wealthy”, with fortunes of more than $30m (£26.5m). That means there are more ultra-wealthy people than the populations of Iceland, Malta or Belize.This week, a group of more than 80 millionaires called on governments permanently to increase taxes on them and other members of the wealthy elite to help pay for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4146b4dd2fb6295819f8b299edb0ca28442ad1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82da8a0f13e16e26a550371e83bbc50","title":"in conversation with benjamin zephaniah and george the poet pocast","story":"Benjamin Zephaniah and George the Poet are two of Britain’s most successful contemporary poets.

We’d been vaguely set up by a mutual friend – my flatmate – and, somehow, our pheromones cut through the throbbing, nondescript house music and nudged us towards the bar for tequila shots and flirtation …It may have been dance music that inadvertently brought us together on the sticky lino, but it was a best of Bon Jovi album back at the ranch that sealed the deal. Our mutual appreciation for this very specific brand of poodle-rock had us sitting on the floor in a corner, duetting the entire album, and oblivious to our friends shuffling out of the room with their bleeding ears.\u0026nbspEnter Spotify Premium Duo, which, while not promising to revolutionise anyone’s sex life, is nonetheless aimed at satisfying cohabiting couples – through the medium of algorithms.Premium Duo is a new monthly subscription service exclusive to two people living in the same household, and takes “the couple that plays together stays together” adage literally. It also works out much better value than if two iniduals take out single subscriptions.I was one of the many free Spotify users who recently decided I needed interruption-free music. I sussed out the subscription options and, since my boyfriend was also a free user, it was a no-brainer to pool our resources on Premium Duo.Exactly like the Premium subscription, the benefits of Premium Duo include ad-free music, ie no enforced shuffle or caps on skipping tracks, while each of you can listen to your own stuff simultaneously and independently – you don’t have to take it in turns.\u0026nbspSigning up is a doddle and you can invite your other half into the account via email, WhatsApp or text. You each have your own login – there’s no shared email or password – and if you’re already Premium subscribers, you can upgrade to Premium Duo and see your music, playlists and recommendations migrate to the new plan respectively.\u0026nbspSo far so easy, but what about the algorithmsplaying-together-staying-together bit? That’s where Duo Mix comes in: a combined playlist put together by Spotify, based on the music each person is listening to. So no more bickering about who’s in charge of the tunes, but a 5050 melange of your favourite bangers, ballads or whatever else tickles your collective fancy.Once registered to Premium Duo, both parties need to join (or leave) Duo Mix either via the app or at www.spotifyaccountduo. Both users will need to listen to their own stuff for a few weeks, to give the algorithm a chance to populate the new, bespoke playlist, then, hey presto, Duo Mix will be located in the Made for You section.What we learned over a couple of weeks of getting to know Premium Duo – and Premium Duo getting to know us! – is that our tastes are pretty aligned, and that there’s a world of music out there to discover and enjoy together. There’s certainly more to us than repressed Bon Jovi fandom and a litany of 90s pop hits. As two middle-aged people, we have a habit of fixating on music that shaped our mid-teens and late-20s, so we both appreciated Duo Mix suggesting contemporary acts in our mix, such as Halsey, Idles, Jake Bugg and Chvrches.We can also tweak our Duo Mix according to the vibe we’re trying to achieve. When we’re working from home, we favour silence and birdsong during weekdays. But when it comes to domestic chores, cooking and Sunday afternoons reading the papers, we can switch between Duo Mix’s Upbeat and Chill playback options, categorising tracks into jaunty or mellow.\u0026nbspSo if you’re at home with your loved one, and listening to different music in different rooms (or on headphones), it might be time to unplug and reconnect. “After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music,” said Aldous Huxley, and, safe to say, for every murmur of a baby boom after the coronavirus pandemic, there are many more couples struggling to get their mojo back.

Miniature flares have been proposed as a theoretical explanation for the so-called coronal heating problem, but until now no telescope has had a good enough resolution to observe the sun’s atmosphere in sufficient detail.The latest footage, taken at 77m kilometres (48m miles) above the solar surface between the orbits of Venus and Mercury, reveals flickering beacons, each ning just a few hundred kilometres across and lasting minutes, before fizzling out again.“The campfires are little relatives of the solar flares that we can observe from Earth, million or billion times smaller,” said David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, a principal investigator on the mission. “The sun might look quiet at the first glance, but when we look in detail, we can see those miniature flares everywhere we look.”The $1.3bn mission was launched in February and will ultimately provide the first glimpses of the sun’s uncharted north and south poles when the probe reaches a vantage point above the planetary plane late next year.As it moves closer to the sun, the spacecraft will be exposed to scorching temperatures, requiring its camera and other instruments to be housed behind a titanium heat shield coated in a substance called SolarBlack, made from charred animal bones. The instruments and camera peer through peepholes that shut whenever there is a risk of them overheating.The latest images show what is happening in the lower layers of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the corona, that extends millions of kilometres into outer space. The coronal temperature is more than a million degrees Celsius, orders of magnitude hotter than the surface of the sun, which is a relatively cool 5,500C. Solar physicists have been trying for decades to resolve the mystery of why the corona is quite so hot. “One of the theories is that you have all these really small solar flares going off all the time all over the sun,” said David Long of UCL’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, a principal investigator on the mission. “What we’re seeing in these images are there are very small brightenings going off all over the sun.”It is possible that the flares could provide enough energy to heat up the corona to its observed extreme temperature. Further observations and analysis are needed to confirm whether this is the case.Solar Orbiter is now on a tour of the inner solar system on the far side of the sun, meaning it is out of everyday contact with the Earth. That will bring it into an orbit about 42m kilometres from the sun over the next two years. By 2025, its orbit will have an inclination of 17° – high enough to take images of the sun’s poles – and if the mission is extended it could reach an inclination of 33°. Mission scientists say that observations of the poles could reveal the processes driving the Sun’s 11-year cycle of activity.• This article was amended on 16 July to correct the date when the Solar Orbiter’s incline would allow it to take images of the sun’s poles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b65c82598612a5ca6c60204893d63ea27bcd41bd/0_0_3746_2497/master/3746.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5a683e32f6a58185aa73b9a79d22b42f 1320w","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"Following news that almost 650,000 people have left company payrolls since March, we would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusThe number of people on company payrolls in the UK has dropped by almost 650,000 since March, as unemployment continues to soar due to the coronavirus pandemic.We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus over the last three months.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

The aim is to help rural economies hit by months of lockdown.“In just a few days our lives changed,” says leading member Gianluigi Bettin, a guidebook writer and sustainable-tourism expert. “We became suddenly aware of our vulnerability.

According to the World Health Organization, about 23 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, and more than 130 are in development.Biotech firm Moderna and the National Institutes of Health said their vaccine provoked a desired immune response in 45 iniduals it will move on to larger-scale testing at the end of the month. The University of Oxford, which has paired with drugmaker AstraZeneca to create another vaccine, said it was anticipating “positive news” on early trials of its drug.The mumps vaccine, widely considered the fastest ever developed, took four years. Experts explain what goes into developing a vaccine – and what comes next.Angela Rasmussen: I’m optimistic. It’s not necessarily going to be the perfect vaccine. We might find early evidence that some of these vaccines are at least partially effective, and that’s enough for now because the need is so great.Rasmussen: Even though it might not provide sterilizing immunity, which is the ability to prevent infection completely, it might provide protection against severe disease.Studies done with Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine suggested that it prevented the disease from forming in the lungs of monkeys that were vaccinated. In that sense, a vaccine that’s partially effective might not be able to prevent transmission or infection, but if it reduces the disease’s severity, that’s still a public-health benefit.Rasmussen: Phase one trials are only looking at safety. You’re giving the vaccine to a smaller group of patients to make sure that the vaccine doesn’t have any negative side effects.A phase two trial is usually testing for a combination of safety and efficacy. A phase three trial is like a phase two trial, except it’s with a lot of people. In this case, we’ve kind of gone straight from phase one into combined phase two and three trials.Rasmussen: You lose the ability to do a complete and thorough phase three clinical trial. You need to wait for people to be exposed to the virus and like they’re not necessarily going to be exposed immediately. Another thing about many vaccine trials is that part of the intent is to see how long antibodies last, and there’s no way to hurry up that process.It’s really good that there are multiple vaccine candidates being developed because even if we have some kind of vaccine by early 2021, it might not be the most ideal vaccine for providing long-term immune protection.Rasmussen: Humans challenge trials are a bad idea for a couple of reasons. One, patients can’t actually give informed consent to participate in a trial like that, because there’s so much that we still don’t know about this virus.Durbin: After you’re infected, cells in your body produce antibodies. When the virus goes away, those cells decrease in number, but you have a memory response. We call that the anamnestic response. I’m not necessarily relying on the amount of antibody in my blood, but rather on my body being able to recognize the pathogen and mounting a response very quickly.Rasmussen: It’s possible we might need a booster for any type of vaccine – and that’s not uncommon. Many vaccines don’t provide lifelong protection.The first vaccine will probably be rolled out on a priority basis, and that is going to be a subject of huge debate and controversy. I would imagine that health workers and essential employees will be among the first to get it.A lot of it will depend on the type of vaccine. The Moderna vaccine, for example, is very easy to manufacture, but the challenge is that that has to be kept very cold. So a vaccine like that might be easy to manufacture, but it’s not as easy to distribute.That being said, I will definitely be taking the vaccine as soon as it’s available."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe4c177ac196e0d48d468fc616fd7c39f49fd8b/19_0_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3fa7e3166ab19e7e0ad061627624e24d","title":"a single use face mask or one like amber heards how i learnt to choose wisely","story":"As more countries make coverings compulsory, Nazia Parveen experiences face mask envy during a work trip to MallorcaParis Hilton likes hers made from mesh, encrusted with rhinestones, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have opted to wear bandanas for their dramatic daily court appearances. Meanwhile, for most of us it’s the disposable versions that can be bought from most high-street chemists.But whether they are bejewelled with diamante or made out of beautiful cotton fabrics, wearing or not wearing a face mask in shops has become the latest polarising debate on social media – with the reaction ranging from the humorous to downright outrage.It will be compulsory to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England from 24 July, with those who fail to follow the new rules facing a fine of up to £100.During a recent work trip to Mallorca, my first foreign excursion since the world hit self-destruct, I was confronted with the prospect of wearing a mask for long periods of time. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200715-53148-gdn.pw.200715.ds.to_mask_or_not_to_mask.mp3 My choice was a Superdrug pack of 10 single-use medical masks hurriedly purchased a day earlier. My mask went on the moment I stepped into Manchester airport and, bar a few short breaks to sip a drink and hurriedly eat a sandwich, it remained on for six hours until I reached my hotel.The following day, walking through the streets of Palma, popping into shops and getting on a bus, I once again donned my three-ply, ear-looped travel buddy, as it is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in stores on the Spanish island.But as temperatures hit 30C the mask got sweaty and, with no escape for the warm air, nausea set in. I instantly started to regret my mask choice, jealously eyeing up those who had obviously done their research. I began to suffer from mask envy.Next came the not-so-attractive steamy sunglasses as my mask flipped about, not quite fitting the bridge of my nose. After hours of wearing the elasticated loops my ears began to chafe, an unusual, but distinct, discomfort behind my lobes.Lessons were well and truly learned, and I will be armed with research before future mask purchases, as more countries globally make it mandatory to wear them in public spaces.The Costa del Sol, where around 2.3 million Britons holiday every year, recently made it compulsory to wear masks in public at all times, in line with the other tourist hotspots of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. Exceptions are made only for sunbathers on beaches and pools, when eating or drinking, while practising sport and while playing a wind instrument. However, in Catalonia tourists are still required to wear masks at the beach or by the pool.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Across the border in France, the rules are slightly less stringent. While it is compulsory to wear face masks on public transport, it is up to inidual shop owners to ask their customers to wear face coverings. This, though, could be subject to change, with the French prime minister, Jean Castex, recently signalling that face mask use in enclosed public spaces was under consideration.Meanwhile, in Italy, although holidaymakers will not receive a fine for non-compliance, it is mandatory to use masks in enclosed public spaces. Flout it at your peril, as mask-less people will be removed from public transport.Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against the virus, followed by surgical grade masks, but they are costly and reserved for healthcare workers. Then there are the homemade reusable cloth versions and the single-use paper ones.Whatever you decide on, face masks are here to stay – for a while at least – so spend the next week choosing wisely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e814766b60ff64f8ee51b9af28f9f297fbaf671/143_465_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a646e2c4cb5c3d3454a84a0889c6bbf6","title":"uk government orders halt randox covid 19 tests over safety issues","story":"Care homes and members of public told to immediately stop using firm’s kitsThe UK government has instructed care homes and members of the public to immediately stop using coronavirus testing kits produced by a healthcare firm after safety problems were discovered.Randox was awarded a £133m contract in March to produce the testing kits for England, Wales and Northern Ireland without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.Under the contract, the kits are sent to the public and places such as care homes and then delivered back to Randox to check swabs to see if iniduals have the virus.On Thursday the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, told MPs: “We’ve identified some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we’ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.“And while we investigate further, we’re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits is paused in all settings until further notice. Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.”The Department of Health and Social Care did not explain the nature of the problem or say how many testing kits have been affected.In a statement, the department said its instruction only “applies to unused Randox test kits, which are clearly marked with that name. Used Randox test kits can still be collected for processing as normal.” Randox said: “As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batchsupplier of swabs. This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business which uses a different supplier of swabs.”Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health minister, tweeted: “Ministers overstated testing figures by 200,000 \u0026amp now home testing kits don’t meet safety standards with use of all Randox test kits paused. Test \u0026amp Trace costs £10 billion \u0026amp increasingly chaotic with private firm after private firm failing to deliver.”The owner of one care home received an email from the NHS on Thursday morning asking them to “store all of your unused Randox kits in a safe place to ensure that they are not used or mixed with other test kits, and one of our team will be in contact over the next week to confirm next steps.”In May the  revealed that Randox had been awarded the contract under fast-track arrangements. These enable public bodies dealing with the coronavirus to urgently award commercial contracts without asking other firms to bid for them.Randox employs the Conservative politician Owen Paterson as a £100,000-a-year consultant. The former cabinet minister and leading Brexit supporter has been a consultant since 2015.Previously Randox has not responded to questions about whether Paterson was involved in securing the contract.  did not receive a response when it asked Paterson for a response.In May, Mark Menzies, the Conservative MP for Fylde in Lancashire, raised the issue of the Randox testing kits in parliament. He said a care home in his constituency where half of the residents had died from coronavirus could not secure testing for other residents.Menzies said: “Six of the remaining residents are displaying symptoms, but they are being told that they will have to wait until mid-June for further tests, following errors made by Randox a few weeks ago.” Hancock said at the time that he would try to resolve the problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a759a82097bcae4e78ee02afb7267136bf0f9057/0_251_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6f8a2e9d103db09fb84bab30f2f817","title":"i am germany berlin alexanderplatz gets new hero in cinematic adaptation","story":"Burhan Qurbani’s hopeful reimagining of Alfred Döblin’s classic novel premieres in Berlin this weekThe story of a man who tried to be good “but then ran out of money”, Alfred Döblin’s classic novel Berlin Alexanderplatz has been described as a parable about the futility of ambition and morality in the twilight years of the Weimar Republic.However, a cinematic reinterpretation premiering in Berlin this week finds more hopeful meaning, pondering if the capital’s seedy underbelly could give birth to a modern, self-confidently multicultural Germany.Qurbani, born in western Germany to parents who fled the Soviet-Afghan war, told the  he was inspired to re-read Berlin Alexanderplatz, a set text at many German secondary schools, after moving to the capital.“That’s when this idea of two parallel societies began to overlap,” Qurbani said. “The damaged first-world-war veteran and the refugee traumatised by his journey across the ocean, both of whom have the hubris to say: ‘I belong not on the fringes, but the heart of society’.”In the novel, Biberkopf sells newspapers, vegetables and shoelaces before drifting into prostitution and organised crime. In the film, opening in Germany with a three-month delay due to the pandemic lockdown, Francis works his up way up the hierarchies of a gang in Berlin’s Volkspark Hasenheide, a 100-acre public green space in Neukölln district where dog-walking pensioners, wannabe acrobats and picnicking families coexist with a regimented network of mostly black men selling drugs.Where Döblin builds a literary montage out of Greek myths, folk songs, news reports and billboard adverts, Qurbani cites William Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt and Francis Ford Coppola. The film’s pivotal scene deliberately echoes the opening line of The Godfather: “I believe in America”.“I am here: black, strong, fearless”, says Francis. “I am wearing an expensive jacket, I drive a German car, I have a German girlfriend. I am the German dream. I am Germany”.When Rainer Werner Fassbinder adapted Berlin Alexanderplatz into a 14-part series for television in 1980, the enfant terrible of New German Cinema made the story of Franz Biberkopf’s short rise and long fall feel like a chamber drama.Qurbani’s film, a UK release for which is currently being negotiated, aspires to the type of epic Hollywood cinema about migration into America told by Scorsese or De Palma – “gangster movies that hold up a mirror to society”, the German director said.While critics have universally praised Qurbani’s ambition, some reviews have bemoaned the treatment of the novel behind the film: Die Zeit complained the director and his scriptwriter had managed to “erase everything that made their source material experimental, or challenging”, by investing too much of our hopes in Francis’ personal struggle.Die Welt, by contrast, was convinced that Qurbani’s reinterpretation “is here to stay like Fassbinder’s”, describing the Portuguese-Guinean actor Bungué’s modern-day Franz Biberkopf as “neither a sneaky asylum fraudster nor a poor victim of globalisation”, but “a modern hero, who has to quickly pick up the rules of an unknown environment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7418f6f1b5cca9f6e5350bcf1fca2649f51e8a8/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=54db9a27922e9e5267bab2aac4715040 2020w","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 2m as more countries re introduce restrictions","story":"US sets highest one-day total for the pandemic so far Brazil cases pass 2m India cases top 1m Mexican authorities to impose local restrictionsOur own Oliver Holmes is reporting Israel has lurched back to lockdown measures following a vigorous second surge of coronavirus infections, imposing stringent weekend shutdowns in which shops, hairdressers and attractions will be closed.The government announced the new measures in the early hours of Friday morning, following a marathon emergency cabinet session called after infection rates climbed close to 2,000 a day.Gyms and fitness studios will also be closed at all times, while restaurants, which opened again in May, will return to takeaways and deliveries only. All indoor gatherings of 10 or more people will be banned.Changes start from this weekend, which in Israel begins on Friday afternoon, the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, and last until Sunday, the first working day of the week. Nurseries will remain open, although closures were being considered.Israel Radio reported full lockdowns, with people again confined to their homes, might be imposed from next weekend, following parliamentary approval.The country of nine million was initially praised for a swift lockdown in March that was credited with reducing daily infections to single digits. However, officials and public health officials say the economy was reopened too hastily and without necessary steps take to control the pandemic.With more than one in five Israelis unemployed, Benjamin Netanyahu has faced mounting public anger surrounding his handling of the crisis, with thousands of protesters holding frequent demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.The Israeli prime minister is also fighting three corruption allegations, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust – accusations he denies.On Wednesday, Netanyahu had presented a 6bn shekel (£1.4bn) package, with payments of up to £175 for iniduals, rising to nearly £700 for families, arguing it would boost spending and “get the economy moving faster”.Returning to the grim news that India has surged past 1 million cases. Given India’s population of around 1.3 billion, experts say, one million is relatively low - but the number will rise significantly in the coming months as testing increases, further straining a healthcare system already pushed to the brink.With more than 600 Indians dying daily, lockdowns are being reimposed across the country of 1.4 billion after an easing of restrictions in recent weeks, reports the South China Morning Post. Now trailing only the United States and Brazil, which have 3.6 million and 2 million infections respectively, the milestone is a deeply concerning one: with almost 1.4 billion people, India’s population is more than double that of the other two countries combined and is squeezed into a smaller land mass. India imposed the world’s most-expansive lockdown at the end of March when it had recorded just 1,000 cases. But as the economy noseed, the government eased distancing measures and numbers shot up.Now the SCMP is reporting that senior members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government have begun telling citizens they must “live with the virus” as they focus on India’s relatively low fatality rate as a marker of success, and try to build capacity to catch sick people early and treat them.So far, three states – Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu – have accounted for the majority of cases. Authorities imposed fresh lockdowns and designated new containment zones in several states this week, including the largely rural Bihar state in the east and the southern tech hub Bengaluru, where cases have risen.But as the SCMP reports, in India’s vast countryside, which is much less prepared and with weaker health care, the pandemic is clearly growing.“The acceleration in cases remains the main challenge for India in the coming days,” Dr Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute told the paper, adding that the vast majority of cases were still being missed.Dr Kapil Yadav, assistant professor of community medicine at New Delhi’s premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences went further. The million cases so far recorded likely left out many asymptomatic ones, he told Reuters. “It’s a gross underestimate.”The South China Morning Post is reporting that a third peak is feared in Hong Kong as more than 60 new cases, a mixture of confirmed and preliminary cases, were reported in the city today. A potential new cluster has emerged in Jockey Club Harmony Villa, a elderly care centre, according to two medical sources. A bus driver has also tested positive. On Monday, he drove four buses criss-crossing the city, along Route 23 which links North Point with Pok Fu Lam. It is the second elderly care home to be infected: the first, at the Kong Tai Elderly Care Centre in Tsz Wan Shan, has so far infected at least 42 elderly residents and employees, with two fatalities.As of Thursday, the city’s overall tally reached 1,655 cases, with 10 related deaths. Since July 6, 120 out of 299 local infections have been untraceable.On that fairly shocking note, it’s goodbye from me, Helen Sullivan, and over to Amelia Hill, who will bring you the latest. Before I hand over, Johns Hopkins has just posted the figure we have been waiting to confirm for the last few hours. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government data, the US has recorded a startling 77,300 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours. This is the highest one-day total for the pandemic so far. The US has consistently broken one-day records in recent days, but this is by a fairly wide margin. 10 July marked the last global record increase, with 67,800 new cases in the US.The US, by far the worst-affected country worldwide in terms of the number of cases and deaths, has 3,576,221 confirmed infections and 138,358 fatalities. Brazil is next highest with 2,012,151 cases (the country passed the sombre milestone of 2m on Thursday) and 76,688 deaths. Here is more on the US specifically: And here is our global report: That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. My colleague Amelia Hill will be taking you through the next few hours of pandemic news. Before I go, here is some Friday inspiration – I’m not sure whether this African clawless otter has grown more comfortable around people because of lockdown, or whether he was just too delighted with the sunshine after a week of rain to care about the camera, but here is a video (taken by my mom) of a very relaxed creature enjoying a sand bath at a beach in Simon’s Town, South Africa: US Democrats have urged elected leaders and party delegates to skip the national convention in August as coronavirus cases surge, the New York Times reported, in what the paper says is “a sign of the ever-shrinking aspirations for their big campaign event in the face of the spreading virus”.In an email to congressional aides, senior adviser to the convention committee Chasseny Lewis wrote: “We have been working closely with state and local public health officials, as well epidemiologists, and have come to the hard decision that members of Congress should not plan to travel to Milwaukee.”Early on Thursday, the Republican National Committee announced plans to scale back its convention scheduled for next month in Jacksonville, Florida. It had moved the event from North Carolina before the surge of cases in Florida, hoping for fewer restrictions on crowds.Meanwhile, around the world, countries are re-imposing localised restrictions as new virus clusters or outbreaks emerge:The known number of Covid-19 infections passed 13.8m on Friday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker , with 13,805,296 cases currently registered.Cases are currently climbing by around 200,000 every 24 hours, with roughly a third of these accounted for by daily increases in the US, which have been surging by around 60,000 per day for at least nine days. Deaths worldwide are climbing towards 600,000, with 589,911 currently registered on the database, which relies on official government data. The true number of infections and deaths is believed to be higher, due to differing definitions (of what constitutes a death caused by coronavirus, for example) and testing rates, as well as delays in reporting and suspected underreporting. These are the ten worst-affected countries worldwide in terms of number of cases: A new video from Ugandan film director Isaac Nabwana is a move away from his previous output – movies heavy on blood and gore and ultra-low on budgets – which is gaining him an international cult following. And he says the pandemic’s impact in pushing film online, with the trend towards all-digital film festivals, has helped.He calls his style “action comedy”, others have called him Uganda’s Quentin Tarantino, but his films have attracted so much attention that fans from around the world visit his Kampala studio and pay to appear as extras, mostly to be killed, in his movies. “We give them a part,” he says, “we have killed more than 200 people that way. We had people come from Switzerland on their honeymoon to take part, they just wanted to die in a movie and they were happy.”On Thursday, health authorities in Urumqi said a 24-year-old woman with symptoms such as a sore throat, fever and headaches, tested positive for the virus. Three people with whom she had close contact tested positive but did not show symptoms.Also on Thursday, the eastern province of Zhejiang reported an asymptomatic case involving a traveller from Xinjiang.The tally of mainland China’s confirmed infections is 83,622 by the end of Thursday, with deaths unchanged at 4,634. Another 104 asymptomatic patients are under observation.Beijing, which suffered a fresh outbreak last month, reported no new cases for an 11th consecutive day.Winston Peters, New Zealand’s deputy prime minister, has voiced his anger at the “looseness” of Australia’s leaders in handing the latest coronavirus outbreaks, and offered to give Victoria the benefit of Kiwi experience in fighting Covid-19.“I am looking at the premiers of the states in Australia, at Scott Morrison and I feel a great deal of regret that looseness allowed this thing to get out of control in my view, in Australia,” Peters told the Today Show on Friday.“I do hope you get on top of things in Melbourne. It’s a great state but boy ... what can I say. If we can help, give us a shout.”Victoria endured another record day of new coronavirus cases on Friday, with more than 428 people diagnosed and three deaths. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Friday that 370 of the new cases discovered over the past 24 hours were under investigation, while 57 were connected to known outbreaks.The fresh outbreak has further delayed long-mooted plans for a trans-Tasman travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand:More on Israel from Reuters: Israel imposed a new weekend shutdown on Friday and tightened a series of coronavirus curbs to lower infection rates, amid growing public anger over the government’s handling of the crisis, Reuters reports. People would be allowed to leave their homes this weekend but malls, shops, pools, zoos and museums would shut from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, the government said in a statement.Full weekend lockdowns that could confine people to their homes may be imposed by 24 July, after the government gains parliamentary approval for that, Israel Radio reported. Weekends in Israel begin on Friday afternoon, the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, and last until Sunday - a working day.On all days, gatherings will be limited to 10 people indoors and 20 outdoors and restaurants would be allowed to serve take-out only, the government said. A further decision on whether to keep summer schools and nurseries open would be made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Benny Gantz.Israel, with a population of 9 million, has reported more than 44,000 coronavirus cases and 377 deaths.Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Malta marked a week without new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the first since the virus was detected there for the first time on 7 March, Reuters reports. Health Minister Chris Fearne confirmed in a tweet that no new cases had been detected for a week. The last was a single case on 9 July.“We must continue to be prudent to maintain our success,” he said.Around the world, countries are re-imposing localised restrictions as new virus clusters or outbreaks emerge. In Mexico, authorities imposed local restrictions on mobility, commerce, and leisure, particularly in popular tourist destinations, even as the government seeks to revive the battered economy. Mexico has 317,635 cases and 37,574 deaths.In Spain, officials in Catalan said on Thursday that residents in three districts in the Barcelona suburb of L’Hospitalet de Llobregat must stay indoors amid a resurgence in cases. Wednesday saw residents told to stay at home in an area in and around the north-eastern city of Lerida, a measure affecting around 160,000 people. They are allowed to leave to go to work, buy food or medication, or to exercise.The Israeli government is reported to be considering a full national lockdown at weekends and plans to shut all kindergartens. Israel has 46,059 cases and 384 deaths.In India, new restrictions have been introduced in the western city of Pune and other states including Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, badly hit Tamil Nadu and Assam. The northern Indian state of Bihar, with a population of around 125 million people, started a 15-day lockdown from 16 July.

They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.In the pre-clinical stage of testing, researchers give the vaccine to animals to see if it triggers an immune response. In phase 1 of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune response it provokes. In phase 2, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people so scientists can learn more about its safety and correct dosage. In phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm its safety – including rare side effects – and effectiveness. These trials involve a control group which is given a placebo.

US visitors were the largest international group and made up one-third of the total figure.The new visitor centre is part of the Old Library Redevelopment Project which also includes the refurbishment and alteration to both to the Old Library built between 1712 and 1732 and to the Berkeley Library on the TCD campus.‘Conservation challenges’A spokeswoman for TCD stated: “The Old Library faces a number of conservation, structural and environmental challenges which need to be urgently addressed in order to safeguard the building and its contents for the next century.”She stated: “The pandemic and recent events go to further highlight the importance of preserving this national historic site and improving visitor facilities in keeping with health and safety protocols.”The redevelopment plans recently lodged with Dublin City Council have been two years in the making, led by architects Heneghan Peng, and were concluded just before the Covid-19 lockdown.Documentation lodged with the plan states that the proposal aims to protect the library collection against further deterioration and to improve facilities for visitors and enhance the visitor experience.Crowd managementThe visitor centre welcome and ticketing area is to be located underground while planning documentation shows that crowd management technology is to be installed.TCD wouldn’t be drawn on the costs of the project. The TCD spokeswoman said: “Funding for the redevelopment project is under consideration. The focus on the coming year will be on planning and developing the detailed design and securing planning permission.” On the timescale of the plan, the spokeswoman said: “This is a complex project and its overall duration is currently under consideration. It will depend on a number of factors including the overall planning process and funding for its development.”A decision is due by the city council on the plan at the end of next month.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306474.1594938276!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 wage subsidy scheme may remain to end of year under july stimulus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar arrives at the Convention Centre in Dublin for a Dáil session on Thursday.  Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTánaiste Leo Varadkar has said continuing the wage subsidy scheme, and commercial rates waiver, until the end of 2020 will be central considerations of its major July stimulus to be announced early next week.Mr Varadkar has also said he will consider extending the wage subsidy scheme – which is due to come to an end on October 31st – to seasonal workers and others who might not have been on the payroll last February. He also indicated a reboot of the already-operational restart grant for businesses. He told the Dáil it had been “very beneficial for many businesses” but some other businesses did not qualify who perhaps should have. He also accepted that the grant north of the Border was “more generous than it is here”.The July stimulus is the Government’s centrepiece policy to try to restoke the economy after four months of near standstill during the coronavirus pandemic. It will be signed off by the Cabinet on Monday and launched on either Tuesday or Wednesday next week.The Tánaiste also gave a strong indication he will not introduce a voucher scheme for the tourism and hospitality sectors as a stimulus measure. He has said, however, that the multibillion-euro package will include stimulus measures for these sectors which have been amongst the most adversely affected throughout the course of the Covid-19 restrictions.He said that vouchers had their limitations and would be “no good to a pub that is closed or a nightclub that is closed or a wedding venue that can’t hold weddings of more than 50 people”.‘Shopping list’Sinn Féin had proposals to launch for the July stimulus package and Mr Varadkar told the party’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty it would be a “very long shopping list”. Mr Varadkar argued that State borrowing needed to be limited to €30 billion in 2020, which was already the biggest deficit in the history of the State.Both Sinn Féin and Labour published their own July stimulus proposals on Thursday ahead of the Government announcement next week.Sinn Féin’s enterprise spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly announced a package of measures worth €8.5 billion. It includes the tourism and hospitality voucher of €200 for all adults, and €100 for all children. The cost of the scheme would be €860 million.The party has also proposed a €1.5 billion scheme that would allot grants of between €12,000 and €25,000 to small and medium enterprises. Ms O’Reilly also proposed a €2 billion back-to-business loan scheme. Businesses could borrow up to €800,000 with zero interest and no repayments for the first 12 months, and low interest rates thereafter.Sinn Féin has also called for a reduction in VAT to 9 per cent in the tourism and hospitality sector, as well as for the Government to continue waiving commercial rates, and paying the wage subsidy scheme, until the end of 2020.‘Five tests’Labour’s Ged Nash, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, Marie Sherlock and Rebecca Moynihan released the party’s paper titled “Five tests for the July stimulus”.It has called for stimulus spending of at least €10 billion between 2020 and 2022 with a tripling of spending on training and reskilling, to re-employ people in those sectors where jobs disappeared during the pandemic.Its proposals include short-term working schemes, a €10 increase in core welfare rates, a 2 per cent cut in VAT rates, investment in State enterprises to create sustainable jobs, and more investment in schools and education to ensure a safe return in September 2020.“With borrowing costs at record lows, now is the time to invest in our future, restore productive capacity, address our infrastructural deficit, and triple spending on training and reskilling,” said Mr Nash.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306524.1594964912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eamon ryan appeared to be asleep in d%C3%A1il as vote on lower paid workers called","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEamon Ryan (centre) appeared to be asleep in the Dáil  when a vote was calledGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan appeared to be asleep when a vote was called on legislation relating to lower-paid jobs.

Staged deadlines now might look impressive politically but would be unfair to those living in the centres, he adds.The current system has “always been ad hoc” and was never properly planned, he says. “So-called improvements” have been made over the years, but no consistency has been maintained. “Ending direct provision is a key priority,” he says.The coalition’s programme for government states direct provision will be replaced with a “new international protection accommodation policy centred on a not-for-profit approach”, backed by a properly funded current and capital budget.So far O’Gorman has met with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee to discuss the handover of the direct provision portfolio from the Department of Justice to his new department, but both will have to continue to work closely together. A “fairly substantial” number of Justice staff will have to move.Community supportThe support of local communities for the changes to come after the ending of direct provision will be vital, says O’Gorman: “Engage early, engage accurately and engage comprehensively.“The earlier you start speaking to people, the more information you give them and the more correct that information is, the less chance you have for far-right groups to spread malicious lies.”“As soon as a State body is seen to try and be quiet or mysterious, it allows conspiracy theorists on the far right to fan the flames of public concern,” says O’Gorman, who points to the lessons that must be learned from last year’s protests in Oughterard.Asked if he is worried that an Irish pledge to offer own-door accommodation to asylum seekers will spur more arrivals, he says people quit their homes because of violence and persecution in their home countries.“When you look at the dangers people are fleeing – violence, civil war and climate catastrophes – the push factors are massive. It’s these push factors that are going to determine the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland. I don’t think it’s the pull factors primarily.”The new system may “not satisfy everyone’s demands”, he accepts. But if asylum decisions are made in a shorter time and people can live in a more dignified way, he will feel “we’ve achieved a lot”.The Government could also be “a bit more outspoken about the quiet dictators who through their actions and repression of human rights in their own countries are generating asylum seekers”, he adds.Driving licenceMoving people out of emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB accommodation is a priority to ensure that they get proper supports, while special support services for victims of sexual violence will also be considered, he says.A 2018 attempt to let asylum seekers find work was “embarrassing and complicated”, he says. “I think taking that meanness out of the system is something that we need to look at those small things like making it really hard to get a driver’s licence.”Decisions on asylum applications should be made within nine months to a year, rather than the average 15 months that applied before the pandemic, while asylum seekers should not have to wait nine months before being able to work, he says.Last week’s Ombudsman for Children’s report raises “concerning” information about widespread racism, bullying and exclusion experienced by asylum seeker children in schools throughout the State.“We see from other countries if a gap grows up in that trust ... that creates the potential for trouble in the future.” O’Gorman has himself been the target for social media trolling in recent weeks.However, he declines to debate matters again, saying he has paid “precisely zero attention” to a protest outside Leinster House last Saturday that called for his resignation because he had marched alongside British activist Peter Tatchell at Dublin’s Pride march two years ago.“My focus is on doing this job and I’m not going to be distracted by a small minority no matter how vocal they might be,” he says, adding that he had attended a commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre that day."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers

Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306880.1594971178!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us reports world record number of covid 19 cases in one day","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Teacher Brittany Myers stands in protest in front of the Hillsborough County Schools District Office in Tampa, Florida on Thursday.

The US has consistently broken one-day records in recent days, but this is by a fairly wide margin.The US, by far the worst-affected country worldwide in terms of the number of cases and deaths, has 3,576,221 confirmed infections and 138,358 fatalities.Brazil is next highest with 2,012,151 cases (the country passed the sombre milestone of 2m on Thursday) and 76,688 deaths.India’s cases of novel coronavirus crossed the million mark, the health ministry data showed on Friday, as infections spread out into the smaller towns and the countryside following the lifting of a vast lockdown.USMore than half of all states –30 out of 50 – have reported record one-day increases in cases this month. Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours on Sunday, as the Trump administration renewed its push for schools to reopen. If Florida were a country, it would rank fourth in the world for the most new cases in a day behind the United States, Brazil and India, according to a Reuters analysis.Democratic officials have instructed senators, members of Congress and party delegates not to physically attend their national convention this summer, a sign of the ever-shrinking aspirations for their big campaign event in the face of a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States.The directive, issued Thursday, ensures that little will happen at the convention site in Milwaukee beyond speeches from former vice president Joe Biden, his vice-presidential nominee and a handful of other top party leaders. The remainder of the events – state delegation meetings, parties, voting on the party platform and on Biden’s nomination – will happen virtually or not at all.“We have been working closely with state and local public health officials, as well as epidemiologists, and have come to the hard decision that members of Congress should not plan to travel to Milwaukee,“ Chasseny Lewis, a senior adviser to the convention committee, wrote in an email to congressional aides. “No delegates will travel to Milwaukee, and Caucus and Council meetings will take place virtually.”The Democrat convention announcement came on the evening when Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, would have been delivering his acceptance speech for the nomination, underscoring how profoundly the coronavirus has upended the campaign. Earlier this year, shortly after the spread of the virus shut down many states across the country, the Democratic National Committee postponed its event by a month.Traditionally, conventions have marked the start of the heated autumn campaign season, giving parties a chance to energise their supporters and sway undecided voters with days of pageantry and largely uninterrupted media coverage. Party officials have been consulting regularly with doctors and epidemiologists and say they are following the recommendations of the medical establishment. Their decision comes as president Donald Trump has made clear he wants the Republican convention to go on. Party officials moved it to Jacksonville, Florida, from Charlotte because North Carolina state officials said they would have to abide by social distancing rules.On Thursday, the Republican National Committee announced new details about the convention, confirming a New York Times report this week that the party was planning to shift some events to take place outdoors. Ronna McDaniel, the committee’s chairwoman, said that “a number of indoor and outdoor venues” in Jacksonville would be used, including the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, where the indoor programme had been scheduled to take place, as well as several other locations. For the first three days of the convention, attendance will be limited to regular delegates, while a broader group will be allowed on the final day when Trump accepts the party’s nomination.Many top Republicans are skipping the event, flouting Mr Trump’s desire for an elaborate event attended by large crowds. IndiaA surge of 34.956 new cases in India in the past 24 hours took the national total to 1,003,832. The Health Ministry also reported a record number of 687 deaths for a total of 25,602, adding that 635,757 people have recovered and the recovery rate was continuing to improve at 63 per cent. The grim milestone comes at a time when several Indian states are imposing focused lockdowns to stem the outbreak amid frantic efforts by local governments to protect the economy. So far, three states — Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu — have accounted for more than half of total cases. But in India’s vast countryside, which is much less prepared and with weaker health care, the pandemic is clearly growing. The continuing surge has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states.BrazilBrazil on Thursday passed the 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases mark, with little sign that the rate of increase is slowing as anger grows over president Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the outbreak.Just 27 days have passed since Brazil, which has the world’s second-largest outbreak after the United States, reached one million cases. In recent weeks, there have been nearly 40,000 confirmed new cases per day, according to government figures.By contrast, 43 days passed between 1 million and 2 million confirmed cases in the United States, where the spread of Covid-19 eased briefly in May before accelerating again in June, according to a Reuters tally.On Thursday, confirmed cases in Brazil totaled 2,012,151, while deaths numbered 76,688.Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, is home to around 210 million people – roughly two-thirds the size of the US population.In both countries, contagion has exploded as the virus has gained steam in new areas far from the largest cities. A patchwork of state and city responses has held up poorly in Brazil in the absence of a tightly coordinated policy from the federal government.Despite the rapid spread of the virus, Mr Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, has pressured local governments to lift lockdown restrictions.Mr Bolsonaro, who tested positive for the virus last week, has played down its health risks and fought against social distancing orders, calling their economic effects worse than the disease itself. Under pressure, many governors and mayors have loosened restrictions in recent weeks, fueling bigger outbreaks.In some big cities such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where the outbreak first emerged in Brazil, new daily cases have stabilised and even begun to decline slowly. However, that has been offset by worsening outbreaks in other regions.Among the states with the fastest growing outbreaks are Rio Grande do Sul and Parana in southern Brazil, which had kept a lid on their outbreaks early on.“The disease has evolved not only over time, but also over geographies,” said Roberto Medronho, a professor of medicine at Rio de Janeiro Federal University. “We still have not reached the peak in Brazil because of these successive epidemics occurring in various regions.”He said models show the next million cases in Brazil may come more slowly, as there are now fewer untouched corners of the country. By the end of July or first half of August, Medronho said new daily cases could begin to decline nationally.However, public health experts are raising alarms about the worsening outlook in southern Brazil, which has the coldest weather during the southern hemisphere winter, now under way, and a population that skews older than the rest of the country. – ReutersNew York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"150 jihadis could attempt come uk isil bride shamima begums","story":"Up to 150 terror suspects stripped of their British citizenship could attempt to return to challenge those rulings if Shamima Begum’s case stands, the security services and politicians fear.The warning follows an unprecedented court of appeal judgement on Thursday that Begum, 20, should be allowed to return to the UK to fight the Government\u0027s decision to revoke her British citizenship for joining Isil in Syria.The three judges, led by Lord Justice Flaux, ruled that the Jihadi bride, who left the UK aged 15 to join Isil, could not have a “fair and effective” appeal unless she was present in person to give “proper instructions or provide evidence.”They said this outweighed any risks to national security which could be “addressed and managed” if she returned to the UK.Within minutes of the judgement, the Home Office said it would appeal the “very disappointing” ruling and seek a stay on her return until the appeal was complete.The security services and senior politicians fear the estimated 150 terror suspects deprived of their citizenship and their lawyers will be studying the judgement to see if they could make similar appeals.A Whitehall source said: “Any returning jihadi is a headache. Anybody who went out there to join Isil is problematic. We would have concerns about anybody who has been in her situation. Even if you didn’t think she was dangerous, you would have to switch resources to put her under surveillance.”Sajid Javid, who as Home Secretary revoked Begum’s citizenship, said he was “deeply concerned.” “First and most critically, allowing her - and indeed other terrorists - back into the UK to pursue an appeal would create a national security risk that cannot be fully mitigated, even with the ision of significant resources,” he said.“Second, the judgement and precedents set in this case could bind the hands of the Government in managing past and future cases.“And third, a consequence of this inidual walking our streets would be that it serves as a lightning rod for both Islamist and Far Right terrorists.”Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, said: “The deeply troubling implication of this judgment is that up to 150 terrorists are now legally entitled to enter the UK in order to appeal the decision in their case.    “The already overworked security services will have their work cut out with this potential sudden influx. This decision could have dramatic repercussions for our entire counter-terror strategy.”  It is thought the Court of Appeal has never made such an order before in relation to suspects barred from the UK and stripped of citizenship.  Jonathan Hall, QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told The Daily  that Begum’s personal situation appeared to have been highly influential in the case.  He said judges did not want to prejudge the issue of her citizenship but recognised how young she was when she left the UK and felt able to conclude that her national security risk was “less serious” than others and could be managed.  Mr Hall believed it could have ramifications for some among the estimated 60 British children born to Isil fighters and their mothers who might be in a similar situation.  “Undoubtedly other iniduals will seek to align themselves with Begum’s position, but it is unlikely that this judgment would apply to everyone who left the UK to join Da’esh,” he said.Begum, who married an Dutch-born Isil fighter and is currently living in a refugee camp in northern Syria, has previously said she had “no regrets” over her time with Isil and sparked outrage by claiming the Manchester terror attack was justified.”She is challenging the removal of her UK citizenship on the basis that the Government’s claim she has dual UK-Bangladesh nationality is wrong because Bangladesh is refusing to accept her and she has never lived there. Britain would be in breach of international law if found to have made her stateless.If she returns, ministers fear she will never leave or be extradited as Bangladesh has not only rejected her citizenship but also has the death penalty for terrorists. “Regardless of the final outcome to her case, if Ms Begum was to come to this country, it will prove impossible to subsequently remove her,” said Mr Javid.Richard Walton, Senior Fellow at Policy Exchange and former Head of Counter-Terrorism Command in the politan police, said: “The threat that Begum poses should not be underestimated. If she is allowed to return, she will present a very real challenge to Scotland Yard’s Counter Terrorism Command.\u0027She would likely be arrested and charged with terrorism offences but the evidence against her could be weak, owing to the difficulties of obtaining and seizing evidence in war zones. \u0027If released, she would present an on-going threat and would need to be subject to rigorous monitoring costing the state hundreds of thousands of pounds over months and years”However, former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said Britain should take her back: “We should follow the American example and say it\u0027s a British problem. She was indoctrinated in Britain, the idea that we just palm her off is ignoring our responsibilities to look after British nationals.”Five Britons stripped of citizenship who may benefitIslamic convert Jack Letts, 25, dubbed Jihadi Jack, dual UK-Canadian citizenship, left UK to join Isil after dropping out of schoolJihadi brides Reema Iqbal, 30, and sister Zara, dual UK-Pakistani citizenship, left east London for Syria in 2013Law student Ashraf Mahmud Islam, 23, dual UK-Bangladeshi citizenship, left London for Syria in 2015Mahdi Hashi, 30, dual UK-Somali citizenship, was jailed by a New York court for supporting the terrorist organisation al ShabaabMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"finally achieved work life balance would go back office","story":"I have spent years thinking about what the perfect worklife balance looks like. How to have a fulfilling job that pays enough money not to be miserable, but also enjoy family life? Much effort has been expended discussing the possibilities of achieving that elusive equilibrium.Now, though, Pandora’s Box has been opened, and it seems increasingly unlikely that we’re going to get those tricksy sprites back in. At the beginning of lockdown, a meme went round of a woman sitting at her kitchen table being told she could go back to work. She rattles off, in one long breath, her pre-lockdown daily routine – the getting up early every day to leave the house at 7.45am, packing on to a crowded train, spending £3 on a latte she can’t afford because she hasn’t had time for breakfast, making small talk to colleagues all day, dropping another £8 on lunch and finally getting home really late, beans on toast for dinner and flopping into bed at 10pm, ready to go again the next day. “F––– that”, she says at the end, before pouring herself another glass of wine.It struck a chord because, really, that’s how a lot of us – at least those of us who are able to work from home – feel. Now that we’ve been liberated from the tyranny of the daily commute, the office presenteeism, the offputting habits of our colleagues and endless, tedious meetings – and marvelled at how much we were spending just to go to work every day – why would we choose to go back?Every day, it seems, I talk to friends who, once we’ve stopped grumbling about the newly enlarged size of the weekly food bill and our partner’s irritating work voice, swiftly move on to extolling the glories of their new life.One, an oil trader with four children, has declared he never wants to go back to the office, but just wants to convene with his colleagues once a week for a night out. Another has put her house on the market and is fleeing with her family to rural Oxfordshire, now she’s unlikely to ever be required in the office more than two days a week.Of course, there are downsides. However irritating the colleagues, it can get a little lonely being at home day in, day out. It’s harder to climb the greasy pole without showing face in the office. Younger, single colleagues with no family to turn their attention to at the end of the day report finding it harder to switch off from work. If you’ve got kids, there’s always the risk of a Zoom-bomb. But many have made the calculation that it’s worth it regardless.This is what the PM is up against in his plea for us all to get back to the office and save our city centres. But now that we’ve finally found some worklife balance, why would we go back to the office just to prop up Pret?The news that MPs and peers might temporarily decant to York while Parliament is being renovated is enough to precipitate my own thoughts of escape from the capital.I grew up just outside York, and every time we go to visit my parents I spend an inordinate amount of time on Rightmove. York ticks all my boxes as an alternative to London: it’s got a cathedral for spiritual and musical life, a university for cultural and intellectual stimulation, and a river for aesthetic pleasure.

Vaccine trials for coronavirus, funded by Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund, had gone so well at two separate institutions that Vladimir Putin could look forward to announcing the world\u0027s first approved vaccine for the virus by the end of the year. Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the powerful Russian Direct Investment Fund, a close ally of President Putin, announced at a press conference in Moscow on Thursday that advanced Phase III trials would begin next month, with a plan to produce 30 million doses of coronavirus vaccine by December.Lucrative manufacturing deals had been signed with five other countries to produce a further 170 million doses, said Mr Dmitriev.Almost 2,000 miles away in London, just as Russia was boasting of its breakthrough, intelligence agencies in the UK were painting a different picture, announcing that they had uncovered a plot by Russian actors that has targeted coronavirus vaccine development in the UK, the US and Canada.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a branch of GCHQ, said it had found evidence that a cyber hacking group – Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), better known in the cyber sphere as Cozy Bear – had attempted to steal vaccine secrets being developed in the UK at both the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.Cozy Bear is run by Russian intelligence agencies, either the SVR (equivalent to MI6) or the domestic FSB (formerly the KGB).The prize is clear, because any country that produces a coronavirus vaccine first will have a huge advantage in getting their economy fully functioning before any other. APT 29 had also tried to hack into vaccine research centres in the US and Canada, and on Thursday, the three allied countries decided they had had enough and chose to call out the Russians.Intelligence agencies were guarded about the success of the attacks, which have been launched regularly since the centres first started trying to find a vaccine. We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic, said Paul Chichester,  NCSC Director of Operations, in a rare intervention in the normally secret world in which the intelligence agencies operate.A source said: APT29\u0027s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think tank, healthcare and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.The NCSC gave a large amount of detail, even releasing the digital fingerprints of the tools used by the Cozy Bear hackers in an attempt to help institutions update their cyber defences to protect themselves against similar attacks.That information, released on Thursday, included the IP addresses of servers used by the Russian hackers to control their software, as well as other snippets of code which cybersecurity experts can use to update their networks to automatically scan for and remove the malware.Experts said the attacks were sophisticated, reliant on funding from Russian intelligence to develop Cozy Bear\u0027s cyber weaponry. Cozy Bear had developed two new forms of malicious software – WellMess and WellMail – which allowed them to silently search for research data and funnel it out of the university computer systems without raising alarms.WellMess acts as a portal to smuggle out stolen documents, while WellMail sends hackers information on the username of whoever is logged in to a computer.The software had never publicly been named or examined until the disclosure of the coronavirus hacking attempts.Whitehall sources said there was nothing audacious about the attacks. In stark contrast to the Kremlin-sanctioned, attempted assassination in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal using military-grade nerve agent, the hackers have been operating from the safety of Russian soil.This is a classic Russian modus operandi of trying to steal our intellectual property, said a Whitehall security source.Reports have suggested the Cozy Bear hackers work from office blocks in St Petersburg and Moscow, as well as universities.The Putin regime has for years recruited thousands of promising young computer programmers who could use their expertise for hacking into computer systems in other countries, and on Thursday, investigators working within GCHQ, NCSC and MI5 were confident enough to declare for the first time that Cozy Bear is an offshoot of Russian intelligence.The hackers strike by testing vulnerable systems and finding weak points. They can send out so-called spear phishing emails which impersonate someone the target already knows, such as their manager or a university IT administrator.According to experts, these fake emails tricked targets into logging on to websites which appear to be legitimate university web pages but are actually cleverly designed fakes. When university researchers logged on to the fake pages, they handed their usernames and passwords to Russian hackers.The hackers also frequently scanned the internet in search of any stolen passwords and saved up a large database of stolen credentials in case they ever became useful for future hacking campaigns.It is not as though Oxford wasn\u0027t aware of the threat. The vaccine research is being carried out at the state of the art Jenner Institute, on the edge of Oxford and a couple of miles from the historic university centre.Last month, Professor Adrian Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute and the co-leader of the Oxford vaccine project, told The  that his team were regularly targeted by nuisance people sending so-called phishing emails.The NCSC, he said, was helping the university defend its research from cyber attackers.You know, there are serious IT people who are giving us a huge amount of priority, he said. We treat it very carefully.”Guards had been placed at entrances to the building. I guess they\u0027re stopping anyone who might want to break in and steal the vaccine, which we could take as a compliment, I suppose, he said. But the main issue is data security. We take it extremely seriously.Cozy Bear has spent years honing its skills, and has become particularly adept at breaking into organisations in search of classified information.It first came to public attention when hackers broke into an American research organisation and planted what appeared to be an innocent-looking video of monkeys wearing shirts and ties. But when amused employees shared the video, in the background the file spread malware inside networks that gave hackers access to secret files.In 2014, the Dutch secret services pulled off an audacious intelligence coup by hacking into the security camera system used in a Moscow university building that housed members of Cozy Bear. Dutch spies watched them plan an attack on a US government network which was subsequently thwarted.It didn\u0027t stop the group and, in 2016, Cozy Bear hacked into the US Democratic National Committee alongside a rival Russian group, Fancy Bear. The hack may have changed the course of the US presidential election. After that, Cozy Bear went quiet for a couple of years before targeting Eastern European countries.It is unclear whether the attempts to steal vaccine secrets were successful. There are currently two rival research teams developing coronavirus vaccines in Russia – one at the Gamalei National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology and another at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University.Sechenov is backed by the Russian health ministry, while vaccine trials at the Gamalei Institute are funded by Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund. The Gamalei Institute, it should be stressed, is a reputable research centre.Russia has denied responsibility. We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain, said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin.We can say one thing – Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so

coronavirus","story":"The UK may have already achieved a sufficient level of herd immunity to stop a second wave of coronavirus, an Oxford University study has suggested.Scientists believe the threshold of herd immunity may have been lowered because many people may already be immune to the disease without ever having caught it.According to a new model produced by an Oxford University team led by Professor Sunetra Gupta, as little as 20 per cent of the population may need to be resistant to the virus in order to prevent a new epidemic spreading.It is widely believed that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) required to prevent a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 is in excess of 50 per cent for any epidemiological setting, the study says.Here, we demonstrate that HIT may be greatly reduced if a fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus due to innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. These results help to explain the large degree of regional variation observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths, and suggest that sufficient herd immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave.Leading experts have already suggested that a sizeable number of people may have immunity against coronavirus because of its similarity to viruses including the common cold.The Oxford model, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggests that when resistant people mix with non-resistant people, the herd immunity threshold drops sharply.Read the full study hereGiven the mounting evidence that exposure to seasonal coronaviruses offers protection against clinical symptoms, it would be reasonable to assume that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 itself would confer a significant degree of clinical immunity, the study says.Thus, a second peak may result in far fewer deaths, particularly among those with comorbidities in the younger age classes.Last month, Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who is working with a team at Oxford to develop a vaccine, said there was likely to be a background level of protection for a significant number of people.There is probably background T-cell immunity in people before they see the coronavirus, and that may be relevant that many people get a pretty asymptomatic disease, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

office workers and daily commuters who have been absent for months.But as shops, pubs and restaurants reopen commuters are not following, as public transport networks shunt along on reduced capacity and offices remain closed.Boris Johnson will on Friday tell the nation it is time to get back to work after the Governor of the Bank of England said people\u0027s fear of commuting was holding back the recovery.But with more money in their pockets and the lingering risk of infection if transport networks return to normal, many employees who have spent the pandemic working from home will not relish the thought of a return.Trains, buses and tubes have ground to a halt during the pandemic, and despite businesses beginning to reopen, they are not yet close to returning to normal.Since lockdown began to be lifted across the UK car use has returned to up to 95 per cent of normal levels, according to data from the Department of Transport.But just one in five people are back on the tube, and passengers taking National Rail services are at a similar fraction of previous numbers.National Rail services are running at 16 per cent of former numbers, up from just four per cent in the depths of lockdown.Passenger numbers on buses in London are now at 41 per cent of previous levels,up from a low of 16 per cent, and buses outside London are up to 31 per cent.For those heading to work by car, the death of the commuter during Britain’s lockdown meant far less congested roads, as shown in data from location technology company TomTom.Cities across the UK saw travel times for drivers dramatically fall as employees began working from home, with congestion levels plunging to 30 per cent, 24 per cent and 18 per cent of 2019 levels in Cardiff, Manchester and Reading respectively during the first two weeks of April. Congestion - defined by TomTom as the extra time traffic causes drivers - is now returning back to normal levels, but in the first two weeks of July still remained at roughly two thirds of the average level of congestion seen across the cities in 2019. As workers return to the commute a handful of exceptions stand out in the data - Middlesbrough in particular has already seen congestion on its roads rise to 2019 levels, and the familiar peaks in travel time around rush hour across were still visible in all cities during lockdown, although to a much smaller extent.When the time does come to return to work few commuters seem keen on the prospect, having enjoyed the time, freedom and savings that come with home working.But the aversion to the commute is more likely to stem from a hesitancy to expose themselves to a risk of infection.According to polling from Ipsos Mori at the end of June, when asked how comfortable they would feel doing certain activities when lockdown lifts, 52 per cent of people said they would be happy returning to their offices.But when asked if they would be comfortable using public transport again, only a quarter of people (25 per cent) said they would be fairly or very comfortable.59 per cent said they would be not very or at all comfortable returning to using public transport - posing a particular problem for London.The city relies far more heavily on public transport than any other.For weeks after lockdown was imposed worrying scenes emerged of crowded carriages in the capital, as key workers in London continued to struggle through their journeys to work.According to data from the last census, up to 83 per cent of workers in some London boroughs travel to work on public transport. As people adapted to the change more have begun taking alternative routes, with cycling up by 200 per cent on normal levels according to data from the Department for Transport.For those who cannot cycle or drive, any return to work will inevitably be more risky for city workers.Analysis from the Office for National Statistics revealed more than a quarter of the workforce in some of Britain’s biggest cities - Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, rely on public transport for work.In 10 London boroughs, the proportion of people taking public transport jumps to over half, with two thirds of workers in Southwark, Islington and Tower Hamlets reliant on the tube or bus network.The paralysis that arrived in the UK alongside the virus has allowed many people room to breathe from the crowded and congested commute.And in uncertain times, home working has bolstered the savings of many, making them less likely to want to rejoin the journey in and out of their town and city centres.According to data from the Office for National Statistics, an average of £181 has been saved per household each week from activities which have been prevented by the lockdown.A large portion of those savings is from the avoidance of public transport - a combined £20.30 each week from rail, tube and bus fares. It is more than is being saved from the closure of restaurants and cafes, at an average £19.40 per week per household.But the money saved by commuters during lockdown has ripped a hole in the balance sheet of transport authorities.Before the pandemic TfL - the operator of the capital’s underground, overground and bus networks - had been on track to break even on day-to-day operations, with net costs steadily decreasing since 20156.But with Londoners shunning the tube and the capital’s iconic Routemaster buses, TfL has seen its progress reverse,  forecasting in June Covid-19 will add at least £1.4bn to its net costs.This strain meant in May the UK government gave TfL a £1.6bn support package to keep services running.A Transport for London (TfL) spokesperson said: London\u0027s transport network is absolutely vital to the economic, social and environmental health of the capital.Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, TfL had achieved significant progress in reducing its operating deficit, despite significant challenges, while still delivering a wide range of improvements to the Tube, bus and rail network during the last financial year.The number of people using the Tube and buses remains significantly lower than this time last year but is steadily growing - with the main growth outside the busier times.We remain focused on helping London recover from the pandemic, and on progressing vital schemes which will support the wider UK economy, encourage cleaner, more sustainable travel through walking and cycling and support the delivery of new affordable housing.We will be discussing with Government over the coming months the need for a sustainable and longer-term funding solution that enables us to achieve these aims and keep London moving.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus forces british airways retireentire fleet boeings","story":"British Airways, the world\u0027s largest operator of Boeing 747, said late on Thursday it would retire its entire jumbo jet fleet with immediate effect due to the downturn in travel industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Global curbs imposed to stem the spread of the virus led to a turbulence in air travel, placing the future of many airline companies in doubt.It is unlikely our magnificent \u0027queen of the skies\u0027 will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again, the company said in a statement.BA, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, added that it will operate more flights on modern, fuel-efficient aircraft such as its new A350s and 787s and expects such aircraft to help in achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.A wave of restructuring triggered by the virus outbreak is hitting airlines and industrial firms across the world.In April BA said it would axe up to 12,000 jobs from its global workforce of 45,000 after plunging to its worst ever quarterly loss and admitting air travel will take years to recover. It was reported last month that BA had reached an agreement with its pilots to sack 350 and another 300 in \u0027pool\u0027 for rehiring when needed.The majority of pilots being \u0027pooled\u0027 were expected to be the jumbo jet first officers, according to the Sun.Boeing\u0027s 747, a plane that democratised global air travel in the 1970s but fell behind modern twin-engine aircraft, marked its 50-year flying anniversary in February 2019.The US-based aerospace company and its suppliers signalled the end of the plane, when they set the final number of parts it would need for the 747 jumbo jet program at least a year ago.However, the decision was left in limbo for years amid falling orders and pricing pressure.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning news briefinguk may have reached herd immunity","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.That is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5,500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat the corona are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It is possible the nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeYannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter deputy project scientist at ESA, said in a statement: “It’s obviously way too early to tell, but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries.”“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” said Daniel Muller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter project scientist. “Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner solar system, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of the campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (Spice), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere,” said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the Spice Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six to monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.These include the Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser, which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun’s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun that can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shock waves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument,” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to short out, sparking fires. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300bn to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort by many countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa in the United States.It was built in the UK by Airbus Defence and Space, and launched from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the solar system’s closest planet to the Sun.Gravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft. By November 2021, it is expected to be in operational orbit.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism is much in evidence. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At one point, Leicester accounted for 10 per cent of all new infections in England.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut a report posted by Mr Soulsby on social media on Wednesday showed new neighbourhood data that pointed towards areas with high levels of deprivation in the inner city as the areas most affected by the virus.Local authorities received the neighbourhood data about Covid-19 testing after “asking for some weeks”, said the mayor, adding that the data shows “it is no longer possible to justify the continuation of the ‘lockdown’ across the remaining 90 per cent of the Greater Leicester area”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyMr Soulsby told BBC Radio Leicester on Thursday morning that city officials were “finally” told which areas of Leicester were worst-affected by the coronavirus.“If only we’d had this information in advance, we’d have been able to do what they’re now doing in Blackburn, which is actually working closely with the communities and avoiding having to be locked down,” he said.“I very much regret the fact that the Government didn’t trust us with this data earlier but I think now we’ve got it, we are the ones well-placed here in the city to make sure that we use it effectively.”Officials in the city were not given Pillar 2 testing data, which highlighted the growing number of cases within the community, before the lockdown was announced, Mr Soulsby told The Independent earlier this week.The government will decide later today whether to make changes to the lockdown after examining 14 days of coronavirus data, with health secretary Matt Hancock saying a public announcement will be made “as soon as is reasonably possible”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scientists from Oxford University point to evidence that seasonal coronaviruses may have provided people with some degree of immunity and other may be more naturally resistant to infection.Fears that a second wave of Covid-19 may arrive in the winter and cripple the NHS have been raised, with scientists urging ministers and health chiefs to plan now to get the UK ready for the winter. Experts said a major expansion of the test and trace system will be needed, as well as a roll-out of a major flu vaccination scheme and a nationwide disease surveillance system.On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a partial relaxation of lockdown restrictions imposed in the city of Leicester. The city’s mayor has criticised the government for taking a “sledgehammer approach” to the lockdown, which he said should only be imposed on 10 per cent of the city where infection rates are higher.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Peter Soulsby said he was not surprised but was “bitterly disappointed” by the announcement and accused the government of making a “party political” decision.Study: UK population may have high level of immunity to avoid second wave of Covid-19Leicester mayor \u0027bitterly disappointed\u0027 by lockdown extensionGood morning, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s liveblog covering all things coronavirus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.After two long weeks under lockdown, there is to be no respite for some of Leicester – not just yet. Another fortnight of restrictions beckons for the city and its people. Beyond that, who knows what lies in store for this corner of the country.“I’m fed up, really fed up,” says Sylvia Beynon, a resident of Oadby. The borough, along with Wigston and Leicester itself, is set to remain in lockdown due to its high incidence of cases – yet neighbouring areas have been given the green light to finally lift certain measures from 24 July.“It’s not fair, it really isn’t. I’m just so upset and angry,” adds Ms Beynon. “I think we’re being hung out to dry. We’re all doing exactly what we’re supposed to do. We’re getting the tests, we’re following the rules, we’re doing what’s been asked of us. People’s patience is starting to run thin.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAgainst mounting anger on the ground, the government has made its position and approach clear. Addressing the House of Commons on Thursday, health secretary Matt Hancock said the continuation of the lockdown was “vital for the health of everyone in Leicester”.The latest figures indicate that the virus certainly hasn’t subsided within the city. According to Mr Hancock, the current seven-day infection rate now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people – down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was first announced. Progress, but as Mr Hancock added, there is “still a lot to do”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThere are some small comforts to look forward to, though. From 24 July, restrictions on some non-essential shops and early years childcare will be lifted, while those outside of the reduced lockdown boundary will be allowed to enjoy the freedoms currently available to the rest of the country.But for those caught inside the city’s hotspots, there’s no suggestion yet as to when restaurants, pubs and bars will reopen, leaving Leicester’s hospitality sector vulnerable to further economic damage and decay.“Many small businesses in Leicester are going to struggle to survive during this additional period of lockdown they certainly need additional help from the government,” Nigel Porter, the city’s only Liberal Democrat councillor, tells The Independent.However, he stressed that “putting the economy ahead of health” risked endangering the local population. “At the end of the day the priority has to be to get on top of the virus and until the number of positive cases in Leicester starts to drop the city will remain in lockdown.”While other local leaders have accepted that the city “cannot return to business as usual”, as Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe wrote on Twitter, Sir Peter Soulsby held few punches in his response to the government’s latest announcement.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have left two areas in there – one that has a Liberal Democrat council, the other that has a Labour mayor.“The fact is they have focused in a way that is clearly party political and that’s not a way to deal with the virus.”The mayor’s comments have been met with a mixed reaction among locals, but they nonetheless point to a fraying relationship between Whitehall and Leicester City Council.Of course, Sir Peter is not alone in his criticism of the government. Kamlesh Khunti, a member of the Independent Sage board and a professor of vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, told The Independent that even now, after weeks of awareness around the city’s issues, local public health authorities are “still not getting data quickly enough”.“Local teams need to be more involved too,” he says. “This needs to be all localised. We know all the networks, the shopkeepers, the faith centres, we know the business community. These are the people who can influence what happens.“It has been a complete shock to us. We’re a proud city and this has not been good for anyone here. It’s not good for the community, for our businesses or our universities.”He said that although he was saddened by Thursday’s news, he was not necessarily surprised, explaining that an increase in targeted testing across the city’s most infected areas would be reflected in the statistics.“We will identify more patients if we continue doing more tests, especially in this high risk population. Worryingly this strategy may continue our city having high rates for quite a few weeks with disastrous consequences.“The high rates are not because people aren’t socially distancing - they’re all doing that has been asked of them over the last few weeks. This is why our local people are shocked, frustrated and angry.”Understandably, the continuation of lockdown is proving a tough pill to swallow for Leicester – especially compared to the soft-touch approach adopted by authorities in Blackburn with Darwen, where residents have been urged to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings after a recent spike in cases.“We were never given that opportunity,” says Jon Porter, a resident in Wigston, which has reported the second highest number of infections across all of Leicestershire.“Why wasn’t Leicester given that opportunity? Why weren’t we warned early on that Leicester is struggling? That was when we should have acted and introduce localised measures, like Blackburn. We weren’t told and now it’s too late.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Labour has called on the UK government to step up and take a leading role in the international response to coronavirus at a meeting of finance ministers from major powers this weekend, warning: “We can no longer afford to be absent from the world stage.”Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds and shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy wrote to their Conservative opposite numbers urging them to follow the example of Gordon Brown when he led the global response to the financial crisis in 2008.They warned of the danger of financial contagion from the Covid-19 crisis hitting fragile economies, depriving them of the resources needed to contain coronavirus and increasing the risk of a second wave of the disease sweeping around the world.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd they called on Rishi Sunak and Dominic Raab to use the G20 summit on Saturday to support international efforts to facilitate government debt restructures and allow countries with liquidity pressures to make use of special drawing rights arrangements.“The UK led the international response to the 2008 financial crisis and acted within days to prevent the global economy spiralling out of control,” said Ms Dodds.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Our response to the Covid-19 crisis couldn’t be more different. We used to step up to the plate - now we’ve stepped off the stage.“This weekend the government has a chance to put that right. Ministers must step up and coordinate action to support fragile economies so the whole world can pull together and beat this virus.In their letter the shadow cabinet ministers warned of the “serious threat” that fragile economies which are not given the opportunity to restructure existing debts will be unable to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Given their links to other emerging economies – and indeed to our own – without concerted global action the impact on our economy and our health may be severe,” they said.Dodds and Nandy said the G20 needed to take “clear action”  to ensure that private creditors co-operate with internationally co-ordinated debt restructuring by governments, with the UK well-placed to play a crucial role because of the concentration of players in the City of London.And they said the UK government should co-ordinate global action to enable fragile economies to make use of ‘Special Drawing Rights’ issued by the International Monetary Fund to help them deal with liquidity pressures.Ms Nandy said: “At a moment when the world faces unprecedented economic and political challenges, the government is failing to step up and show the global leadership this crisis demands. This crisis has shown that we are only as strong as the most vulnerable – we can no longer afford to be absent from the world stage.“The UK is uniquely positioned to bring together democratic countries from across the world to respond to the threats of Covid-19. The government must use those relationships to coordinate with our international partners and help lead the global response.” The meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors will be hosted virtually by Saudi Arabia on 18 July.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Our social care system relies on many overseas workers, we should be welcoming them in not shutting them out.The new plans, promised for years since Britain voted to leave the EU back in , will see freedom of movement scrapped in favour of an Australian-style points-based scheme.Under the new system, foreign nationals applying to come to the UK for work purposes will have to meet certain criteria.It will assign points for specic skills, qualications, salaries or professions, and visas will only be awarded to those who gain enough points.The minimum requirements will include having a job offer from an approved sponsor that suits their skill level and being able to speak English. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Foreign nationals wishing to come to the UK for work purposes will need to score  points to successfully apply for an online “e-visa”.If an applicant meets the criteria of the minimum requirements, they will be awarded  points.But to score above this threshold they will have to meet other criteria based on salary, seeking to work in a sector with a recognised labour shortage or a having a PhD.While most will be expected to earn a minimum of £, a year, some such as lab technicians with prized skills will be able to come in with a salary as low as £,.To score  points, foreign nationals will need to be able to prove they have a job offer from an approved sponsor that is appropriate to their skill level.A further  points will be scoredthe job is in an occupation with a labour shortage such as engineering or information technology.While a university doctorate gives ten points with the figure rising to  pointsthe qualication is in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.Ten points will be awarded for an annual salary of £,, rising to  points over £,.A builders labourer who cannot speak English but has been offered a salary of £,, for instance, would only score  points and would be blocked from coming to the UK to work.Likewise, a skilled plumber with good English on £,-a -year, would also be awarded  points but denied access.But a primary school teacher offered an annual salary of £,, who also speaks good English, would score  points and would secure a visa to work in the UK.A university lecturer with a maths PhD with an offer of a £, would be awarded  points and would also secure a visa.It follows the points systems used in Australia and New Zealand.Ms Patel also announced the beefed-up measures for Border Force and immigration officials today.The Government revealed even criminals not sentenced to  months face being booted out of Britain.It said: Those already in the UK who are sentenced to  months or more in prison must be considered for deportation.Where the -month criminality deportation threshold is not met, a foreign criminal will still be considered for deportation where it is conducive to the public good, including where they have serious or persistent criminality.The change means criminals from the European Union are treated the same as currently happens to those from non-EU countries.Anyone deemed as a skilled worker - including postgraduate students - will still have the right to bring their families and children to the UK.Spouses, partners and children under  will still be eligible to come to the UK and stay.They can also have near full access to the UKs jobs market, and will be able to attend schools here.However, they will be made to pay the health surcharge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only  per cent of firms are looking to increase the size of their workforce.Mr Sunak extended the furlough scheme, but employers will need to start to make pension and national insurance contributions from next month. From September businesses will have to pay  per cent of their staffs wages, with the Government scaling back their support from  per cent to  per cent. By October they will be asked to pay  per cent with a  per cent contribution from the Government.The job losses will be felt most in bigger firms - around  per cent of large firms with over  employees expect to make lay offs, compared to  per cent of micro firms with fewer than  employees.

If you say it, produce the facts”.Today, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the alleged interference unacceptable.He said: The Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable. It is, and will always be, an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections.The Government said today:There is an ongoing criminal investigation and it would be inappropriate for us to say anything further at this point.Mr Corbyn responded to the claims in a Facebook post calling the docs genuine.He said: The documents we revealed during the general election about the danger of a Trump trade deal for our NHS were genuine - as is the threat of a £ million a week higher drugs bill.The Tories want to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support.Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes. Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.It came on the same day the UK was able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.I AM today updating Parliament on the ongoing investigations into the leak of the UK-US Free Trade Agreement documents ahead of the General Election in . The Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee has been briefed on the details of this incident.The Government has robust systems in place to protect the UK against foreign malign influence. These bring together government, civil society and private sector organisations to monitor and respond to interference, to ensure our democracy stays open, transparent and resilient. During the  General Election a cross-Government election security cell was stood up to coordinate responses to threats and hazards relating to the election.On the basis of extensive analysis, the Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable. It is, and will always be, an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections.There is an ongoing criminal investigation and it would be inappropriate for us to say anything further at this point.The Government reserves the right to respond with appropriate measures in the future.The UK will continue to call out and respond to malign activity, including any attempts to interfere in our democratic processes, alongside our international partners. We fully support the recent action taken by our German partners who exposed Russian responsibility for the hack of their Parliament in  as well as their intention to act against those responsible under the cyber sanctions regime. The UK Government laid the statutory instrument for our own cyber sanctions regime on  June.The online forum Reddit confirmed the NHS leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.A statement from Reddit at the time said: We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK.We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.The Labour leader was branded a foolish pawn over the blunder.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverley blasted: Corbyn has some serious questions to answer.Is he a foolish pawn in a Russian disinformation campaign, or did he know where the leaked documents came from Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Labour were quick to pounce on the contents of the papers, claiming they revealed the plot against our NHS.Experts previously raised fears over the origin of the documents.Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at media analytics outfit Graphika, said: “It’s on the same set of websites, it’s using the same types of accounts and making the same language errors.It’s either the Russian operation or someone trying hard to look like it.”Ousted MP and Corbynite Laura Pidcock even got into a row with Skys Kay Burley over the documents, refusing five times to say whether the partys leaked NHS dossier came from Russia.The then shadow secretary of state for employment rights got into a spat with the journalistdays after Jeremy Corbyn claimed hed found evidence that the NHS would be up for sale in a series of papers.The original Reddit posting was uploaded on October  but was little known until Mr Corbyn unveiled it at a highly trailed campaign event.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Addressing the Common’s Science and Technology Committee, he said other Government advisers shared his concerns. Sir Patrick said: “My view on this and I think this is a view shared by SAGE, is that were still at a time when distancing measures are important.“And of the ious distancing measures, working from home for many companies remains a perfectly good option because its easy to do.WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR:“A number of companies think its actually not detrimental to productivity, and in that situation, there’s absolutely no reason I can see to change it.”But Sir Patrick was not finished there. He also delivered a scathing assessment on the timing of the UKs lockdown and Number s overall handling of the deadly pandemic.He said lockdown measures should have been in place a week earlier while the outcome of the coronavirus “has not been good for the UK.”Mr Johnson enforced the countrys lockdown restrictions on March . The respiratory disease has so far killed more than , Britons this year.This comes as the PM is poised to rip-up the work-from-home guidance tomorrow - giving bosses the green light to welcome staff back to the office.He is planning to hold a Downing Street press conference to tell millions of Brits that it will be safe toto the office next month.The PM is expected to appear alongside the Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding to unveil a new Contain Framework designed to prove to anxious workers that the virus is “under control” in their local areas.The pair will also flesh out the Government’s ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy spelling out extra measures to stop outbreaks over the coming months - which they hope will give people the reassurance they need to venture back to the office and onto buses and trains.The move will finally end the blanket work-from-home policy that has seen the vast majority of Brits shut out of the office for more than four months.Today, the UK announced a further  deaths related to Covid- which takes the daily average number of fatalities to its lowest level since March.In Scotland, one person died, ending a seven-day record of no fatalities.Since the start of the pandemic, , people have tragically died in Britain due to the disease.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things. It’s more important than ever now to show that women can support each other and hold each other up.”But there is one person for whom Gemma will always open her purse – her mum Joan.The reality star, left, said: “I like to treat her. I am massively independent and I do like to pay my own way.” Thinking out loud on her BBC Radio  podcast, Gemma mused: “Could we ever get rid of money “I don’t think we could.

Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King. Thank you for all the light, strength and joy you have brought into my le. I feel capable of anything with you by my side.”The pair are believed to have been dating since last year.Jonathan, who hails from the Congo, is the first man she has publicly dated after splitting from rapper HYPO in .Before that she was married to scientist Adam Gouraguine but they split after ten years, just a year after tying the knot.Jonathan headed up a community centre with recording studio in Chad-well Heath, North London, to give kids skills to stay out of gangs. It shut in February after two years.Hopefully he and Emeli last far longer than that.BOYZONE split up for good before the release of their  album and the subsequent tour last year . . . or so they said. But they might already be having second thoughts.Keith Duffy has teamed up with ex-Westle star Brian McFadden to release an album as Boyz-Le, and Brian reckons it’s only a matter of time before Boyzone are back too. He said: “It’s  years since I left Westle so, for me, rejoining won’t happen. But for Boyzone . . . the boys have been together for  years.“Though Keith and I are doing this and Ronan Keating is doing his solo thing,the opportunity comes up for the boys to get together – there is going to be a -year anniversary in a few years – you can never say never.”With  No singles between the two bands, Keith and Brian had plenty of options when picking songs for their Strings Attached album, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which is out today.Keith said: “It made it very easy, the fact we had so many No singles to choose from. You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength. We’ve moved mountains.“We’re pinching ourselves to be given this opportunity again in our ­forties to get on stage.”POP fans would have been in for a shockthey had bumped into this trio in the park.THE Saturdays members Frankie Bridge, Una Healy and Mollie King shared the photo on their catch-up, six years on from their split.I guess their absent bandmates Vanessa White and Rochelle Humes were taking their social- distancing really seriously.MEGAN THEE STALLION is “grateful to be alive” after being shot in the foot at a party at the weekend.

You take the hint.Senior judges said yesterday that Begum, who left aged , should be allowed toto the UK to challenge being denied her British citizenship.It is a bitter blow for the government who revoked her citizenship last year - sparking an appeal which has cost taxpayers more than £, so far.Begum and two pals – Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase – ran away to Syria in February .Begum used her elder sister’s passport to flee with her Bethnal Green Academy friends.The trio flew to Turkey and then crossed the border into Syria with the aid of smugglers.Within weeks of arriving, Shamima was married to Isis jihadi Yago Riedijk, , from Holland.They had two children who died from malnutrition and disease.The couple were separated as they fled Baghouz, the village where a few hundred Isis fighters were holed up in a desperate last stand.Shamima ended up in a Kurdish refugee camp where she gave birth to her third child.Eldest sister Renu revealed that her family had lost contact with her for the “longest time” until she was found by a Times journalist.One source said today: Why should anyone who leaves the UK to join ISIS then complain when they have their British passport taken away Shamima Begum made a conscious choice to go to a terrorist warzone, where she has now been stranded. Shes not able to appeal her case in person as a direct result. Many people will rightly ask, Wheres the unfairness in that The Court of Appeal ruled: Fairness and justice must, on the facts of this case, outweigh the national security concerns, so that the leave to enter appeals should be allowed.But Lord Justice Flaux - sitting with Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Singh - said: The only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal.Begum was one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in  to join ISIS.After initially marrying an ISIS fighter and sewing terrorists into suicide vests, she was found pregnant more than three years later in a Syrian refugee camp - but her baby boy died not long after being born.Figures show her lawyers have claimed £, in legal aid trying to win back her UK citizenship - but sources say the true public bill is at least double and tops £,.When she was discovered and stripped of her citizenship, her own dad slammed her choice to run away to join the terror group.Ahmed Ali said he was on the side of the government and condemned her lack of remorse before claiming he was misquoted.Now that she is able to leave the camp in Syria andto the UK to launch her appeal, it is likely the Government would struggle to send Begum back to a war-torn country - evenshe fails to get citizenship back.Sajid Javid warned: Most critically, allowing her and indeed other terrorists back into the UK to pursue an appeal would create a real security risk that cannot be fully mitigated, even with the ersion of signicant resources.If Ms Begum does come to this country it will prove impossible to remove her.Following the ruling a Home Office spokesperson said: “This is a very disappointing decision by the Court. We will now apply for permission to appeal this judgement, and to stay its effects pending any onward appeal.“The Government’s top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe.”Lord Justice Flaux ruled the national security concerns about her could be addressed and managedshe s to the United Kingdom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The crucial thing is that they are immune.The Oxford Uni study suggests the epidemiological limit to reach herd immunity may be greatly reduceda fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus.This is feasible, they add,people have inbuilt resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.The report says: Signicant reductions in expected mortality can also be seen in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection.Results suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave, the researchers add.It has been evident from the outset that the risk of severe disease and death from Covid- is not unormly distributed across all age classes.The bulk of deaths among the over  million cases reported worldwide are occurring among older age classes and those with [pre-existing conditions].“It is further becoming clear that risk of infection is also not unormly distributed across the population, the reports says.Scientists at Oxford point to those managing to fend off the virus as having high ing immunity.And,antibodies to the disease are built up in - per cent of the population, this is entirely compatible with local levels of immunity having approached or even exceeded the herd immunity threshold.In which case the risk and scale of resurgence is lower than currently perceived, say the researchers.Immunity to the bug has been hitting headlines for months, with Kings College research saying antibody responses to the killer bug “can be detected in most infected iniduals - days following the onset of Covid- symptoms”.It investigated samples from  coronavirus patients,  days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-.Worryingly, Kings Colleges study found that immunity to fight coronavirus might disappear only three months after infection.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, this has met criticism from more #frugal# northern states such as Denmark and the Netherlands, who are demanding a smaller overall package and economic reforms as a condition of securing the loans.

They told the BBC: #Any new system must have independent oversight and dispute resolution.#Unfortunately, the UK government has not managed to share the paper with us, and Welsh ministers have had no recent discussions with the UK government on these issues.#Any attempt to unilaterally impose a system will be deeply damaging.#British firms have started stockpiling goods as they fear the UK could leave the European Union without a deal.A number of listed companies have said they are taking measures to store supplies and review plans in case of border disruption should a deal not be reached, the Financial Times reports.Should a no-deal outcome become reality there are worries about the cost of extra red tape, as well as strict border checks on goods.Lindsey Ruth, chief executive of Electrocomponents, said: “Our priority is continuity of supply and maintaining [a] world class customer experience.#During the coronavirus pandemic Wales gave England more than  million items of personal protective equipment, the countrys health minister has revealed.Mutual aid agreements in place with Westminster, Holyrood and Stormont saw nearly  million items of PPE, such as facemasks, gloves, visors and gowns, given to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Wales had received . million items of PPE from those countries in .Image: GettyPost-Brexit arrangements which the UK Government insists will bring new powers to Scotland pose the #biggest threat to devolution# since Holyrood was established, the SNPs Westminster leader has said.Ian Blackford described plans to create a new #internal market# across the UK once the Brexit transition period ends as a #blatant power grab# from Westminster.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has insisted a #a power surge is occurring# which will see #scores of new powers# transferred to the Scottish Parliament.UK ministers have said theof powers to the UK from Brussels after December , when the transition period ends, will see the Northern Ireland administration receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in .A big story this afternoon – hackers linked to the Russian intelligence agencies are targeting British scientists seeking to develop a coronavirus vaccine, the National Cyber Security Centrehas warned.In a joint statement with the US National Security Agency and the Canadian Communication Security Establishment, the NCSC said the attacks were part of a global campaign by the group known as APT to steal the secrets of vaccine research.NCSC director of operations Paul Chichester said: “We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic.”He said Brits, the US and Canadians believe APT – also known as the Dukes or Cozy Bear – was “almost certainly” operating as part of the Russian intelligence services.Brits heading abroad next year may be left confused regarding their holidays, with the UK leaving the EU Customs Union and Single Market on January , .Brits travelling to Europe after Brexit should be aware that theres new advice around everything from passports and visas to EHIC and driving licences.You can still book holidays until the end of the year without any changes taking place – flights, ferries, cruises, Eurostar, Eurotunnel, and bus and coach services are not yet affected by Brexit.Holidays will still go ahead as usual in  as well, but may require additional travel documents and rules.New passport rules will apply when the transition period ends on January .After the transition period, Brits may need an additional  months on their documents, which means you should double-check whether you need a new passport before you travel.Image: GettyA leaked document on UK-US trade used by Jeremy Corbyn during the  general election was sourced from Russian hackers, foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said today.The papers, which discussed a potential deal, were used by the opposition leader as evidence the NHS will be #on the table# in talks on a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.There is no suggestion Mr Corbyn knew the report had been widely circulated online by actors working on behalf of Moscow.Areas of the UK that voted to leave the EU have suffered the biggest economic hit since the  referendum, according to new research reported by the Financial Times.The study from the Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy at Warwick University suggests Brexit is likely to further complicate efforts to level up underperforming regions.Research found that the parts of the UK with high levels of low-skilled and manufacturing employment have underperformed most since . These areas also heavily voted Leave in the EU referendum.Many of the districts have unusually high levels of furloughed workers, raising the prospect that they could also be hardest hit by the coronavirus recession. A Welsh Government spokesman has released a statement after officials claimed the UK Government was forcing new post-Brexit rules through without consultation.The spokesman said: #We support having rules across the UK to regulate the internal market, but these rules must be agreed between the four Governments in the UK, each of which has their own responsibility for economic development.#Any new system must have independent oversight and dispute resolution.#Unfortunately, the UK Government has not managed to share the Paper with us, and Welsh Ministers have had no recent discussions with the UK Government on these issues.#But UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said there had been discussions with the Welsh Government on #common frameworks# and ministers #have known the direction of travel#.The Welsh Government has warned that forcing post-Brexit trading rules on Wales without its consent would be #deeply damaging#.Plans for a new #internal market# drawn up by Westminster to ensure seamless trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were not shared with Welsh ministers before being announced, it said.Measures that were previously regulated by the European Union willto the UK at the end of the year when the transition period expires, with the UK Government saying it would see Northern Ireland receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in .As this could lead to dferent regulatory regimes in the UK, Westminster has drawn up plans for the #internal market# to make sure set regulations are recognised across the nations, ensuring seamless trade between them.But on Thursday, the Welsh Government said the changes had to be agreed between all the devolved administrations, and that ministers in Cardf Bay have so far had no discussions with those in Westminster.Former prime minister Tony Blair has said Boris Johnson should delay Brexit by a year to avoid a #disastrous no deal#.A study, commissioned by the Tony Blair Institute, says it would be a “grave mistake” for Britain not to agree a delay at the same time it faces a “deep recession” due to the coronavirus crisis.The report said there is a #landing zone for sensible compromise# between the UK and EU to agree on a deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And those measures introduced on the fourth of July will also not apply, he added.However, most schools in Leicester have already broken up for the summer break.The measures would be reviewed again in two weeks to seemore progress has been made, and more rules can be relaxed.He also confirmed that some types of coronavirus swab tests would stop being used for the meantime as the Government assesses their safety.Some were not up to the usual high standards, the health secretary says - but stressed that there is no evidence of harm or impact on test results.The Health Secretary said: I hope these careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to the people of Leicester and Leciestershire.I say this directly to the people... I pay tribute to you. You have all shown respect for one another.I understand this hasnt been easy.There is still a lot to do and the public health messages remain critical.Please do not lose your resolve. The sooner we get this virus under control, the sooner we can restore le in Leicester.The city was the first in the UK to be put back into lockdown last month after a spike in cases.Testing centres swooped on the city and people were encouraged to stay home. Shops were shut up again and pubs and restaurants did not open on July  as in the rest of the country.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: As this data confirms, coronavirus cases in Leicester were signicantly higher than other parts of the country – and we took clear and decisive action to save lives.“We are working closely with the local authorities to ensure that these measures are only in place as long as is necessary, and we will set out the next steps by  July.”The Government has stressed that data has been provided to the Directors of Public Health throughout the incident.The lockdown currently covers the city of Leicester as well as surrounding areas including Birstall, Beaumont Leys, Glenfield and South Wigston. It has been suggested that families living in closer quarters, combined with a higher population of people whose English is a second language, may have contributed to the spike in cases.Workers in cramped clothing factories have also been blamed, with Police and the National Crime Agency investigating possible links to modern slavery.But Sir Peter told Sky News there is no evidence whatsoever to show coronavirus was being transmitted in clothing factories.Theres nothing in the data that suggests it is transmitting in places of work, he said.Mr Hancock revealed flare-ups are being swtly and silently dealt with.He said more than  local actions are being taken across the country each week.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC that data published on Saturday showed the city is really quite an outlier compared with anywhere  in the country.Mr Van-Tam told the BBC: The situation has improved but it needs to go further.He said that, while it would not be his decision to end the lockdown, doing so cant be rushed.Pressed on whether Leicesters lockdown is likely to be lted, Mr Van-Tam said: With any of these things, usually the way that one approaches them from a public health perspective is to take a phased approach.Normally you dont just go from having the brakes on heavily to just taking the brakes off completely.I think thats a reasonable expectation to set.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.The former Labour boss refused to answer questions from journalists outside his home in North London this afternoon.Mr Corbyn was asked by a journalist: Mr Corbyn, Do you have anything to say about Russian disruption  Were you complicit Did you help those who attacked our election, Mr Corbyn Mr Corbyn then shut the gate and said: Goodbye.The reporter continued: Do you have anything to say at all, Mr Corbyn, about whats happened today Do you regret whats happened Are you complicit with Russian interference in our elections, Mr Corbyn Would you do it again, Mr Corbyn Do you have anything to add about what happened, Mr Corbyn Do you regret your actions, Mr Corbyn, do you regret taking that document The ex-Labour leader then shut the door after wheeling his bike inside, followed with another goodbye to the reporter.The Government said today:The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes.Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.A senior Russian politician said today that allegations that Russia tried to meddle in the  General Election are anti-Russian nonsense which undermine UK-Russia relations and the UKs own authority.The Russian Foreign Ministry added: “The statement is so foggy and contradictory that it is almost impossible to understand it.If it’s inappropriate to say something then dont say it. If you say it, produce the facts”.The online forum Reddit confirmed the leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.It came as Vladimir Putins Russia was today blamed for being behind repeated cyber attacks to try and steal a coronavirus vaccine from Britain.The UK has been able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.Heres what we know about the attacks:The National Cyber Security Centre have thrown every protection they have at Britains vaccination projects to keep them safe from attempts to steal information.British research projects are at the forefront of the effort to find a vaccine with scientists at Oxford University and Imperial University London leading the charge to prevent thousands more from dying.Britain is expected to publish a long-delayed report into Russian influence in British politics next week.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The firm has donated a total of £, to the party since April , according to the Electoral Commission. The most recent donation, of £, was made to the party in September . The firm has also employed Owen Paterson, a Tory MP and former minister, as an advisor since , and is paid £, a year. The Mirror understands red flags were raised about the aposCEapos safety stamps on the Chinese-made tests supplied by Randox. Physical inspection of the tests led to questions about the sterility of the swabs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Clinical advice is that thereaposs no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected, there is no evidence of any issues with our other test swabs and there is no impact on access to testing. In a statement issued yesterday, the Department of Health said: “As a precautionary measure and while we investigate further, NHS Test and Trace are requesting that all settings pause the use of Randox test kits with immediate effect and until further notice.” Randox, which described its system as part of the “cornerstone of Government testing across the UK”, was awarded the contract in May as the Government was racing to meet its target of , tests per day. Grilling Mr Hancock in the House of Commons on Thursday evening, shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth questioned the awarding of the contract which he said was “given to Randox without any competitive tender”.  The firm, based in County Antrim, posted on its website in June: “Our test was adopted by the NHS and Public Health England and forms the cornerstone of Government testing across the UK. Using the Randox-patented Biochip Array Technology, the most-comprehensive multiplex PCR  on the market.” As a result of the recall of the kits, a number of testing sites have also been forced to suspend all activity until further notice. This afternoon Wirral Council announced that it had closed down the Bidston Coronavirus Testing Site near Birkenhead “for precautionary reasons, due to a safety recall issued by the Government on Randox test kits”. The Department for Health and Social Care said there wasnapost enough time to perform a full procurement contest because of the short notice in ramping up coronavirus testing.A spokesperson said:   “The speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by teamwork between the Government and key partners.“In a matter of weeks we have engineered the largest ever expansion of British diagnostic capability - scaling up a nationwide network of drive-in testing sites, introducing home testing, deploying mobile testing units operated by Armed Forces personnel, building three new ‘mega labs’ to analyse test samples, and more than doubling the capacity of the NHS and Public Health England laboratories.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lightning lockdowns councils set new","story":"NewsLightning lockdowns: Councils set for new shut down powers in event of outbreaksBoris Johnsons updated road map for re-opening Britain is set to include new lightning lockdown powers for councils which will help them in shutting down pubs and gatheringsShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video vallance-no-good-reason-end-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics lightning-lockdowns-councils-set-new-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It could also mean bans on weddings and other large gatherings at short notice.A Government health source told The Sun: Councils will be able to impose lighting lockdowns where they see fit.Boris Johnson is set update his road map to help Britain bounce back from the pandemic at a Downing Street press conference on Friday.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  As well as the powers for councils, the PM is set commit to a new target of reaching the capacity for , coronavirus tests a day by November. The NHS will be granted an extra £ billion in funding to prepare for a second wave. In the wake of a dire warning of the consequences of Covid- rebounding, No said the funding will allow extra hospital capacity while allowing routine treatments and procedures to continue.  The funding for the NHS in England will allow private hospital capacity to be used and for Nightingale hospitals to be maintained until the end of March. It comes after a report commissioned by the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned there could be , hospital deaths in a reasonable worst-case scenario. Winter always places a great strain on the health service, but there are concerns a resurgence of the virus during the annual flu season could be crippling.  A Government spokesperson said the NHS must be battle ready for winter. Tomorrow, he will set out a broad package of measures to protect against both a possible second wave, and to ease winter pressures and keep the public safe. The spokesman said the immediate funding for England was new and not previously allocated, while expenditure will be set out for the devolved nations in due course. NHS Providers, which represents NHS organisations, deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery has called for urgent clarity over what the funding will cover.  She said funding is already in place for the Nightingale hospitals and private beds, while social care is in a critical condition but the Government is yet to afford it any extra money. The British Medical Association also called for details on how the money will be used. Earlier this week Mr Johnson was warned in the report by the Academy of Medical Sciences that action must be taken now to mitigate the potential for a second peak, including scaling up the Test and Trace system.  The research said capacity for , tests per day will be needed to test iniduals as they show symptoms of either Covid- or flu. The latest Government figures say capacity stood at nearly ,, but Mr Johnson will commit to increase this to half a million by the end of October to bolster Test and Trace. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already announced plans for the biggest flu vaccination programme in history, with eligibility for free injections likely to be extended. Non-urgent operations were suspended to free up hospital beds as the UK was plunged into a lockdown during the first wave. But Downing Street says the new plans to be announced by the PM will allow them to go ahead where possible as ministers target efforts on local lockdowns.

Vladimir Putin’s spies want to steal secrets so Moscow can produce a jab. A GCHQ chief said: “We condemn these despicable attacks.”Britain is fighting off an alleged campaign by Moscow to steal information in a bid to develop a coronavirus vaccine.Russian state-backed spy group APT has launched cyber attacks on UK labs, according to British spooks. The National Cyber Security Centre has accused the Kremlin of trying to rip off findings so Russia can produce a vaccine at the same time or sooner. NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said: “We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the pandemic. “Working with our allies, the NCSC is committed to protecting our most critical assets and our top priority at this time is to protect the health sector.” The NCSC – which is part of the GCHQ eavesdropping station – would not identy who has been targeted, but it is thought to include Oxford University and Imperial College London. They both have high-profile vaccine development programmes. Other centres from across the world are also believed to have been targeted. APT “almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services”, the NCSC added. The centre has issued an advisory warning so that organisations have a better chance of protecting their networks. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: “It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic.“While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine. “The UK will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks, and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account.” APT, also known as Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, has been operating for a number of years but this is the first time the NCSC has publicly linked it to Russian intelligence. The group was previously implicated in attacks on the Democratic Party during the  US presidential election which Republican Donald Trump won.APT’s activities are said to be known at the “highest level” of the Russian state – indicating President Vladimir Putin has sanctioned the attacks. Scientists at Imperial College London and Oxford University have begun human trials of a vaccine. A jab is seen as crucial to lting lockdown. Nations such as Britain have pumped tens of millions of pounds into research but Russia is allegedly hoping to steal the science. UK intelligence does not suggest the hackers are trying to hamper the development of a vaccine – instead they want to copy it. Experts think Russia has tried to exploit VPN connections staff use to link them in a network.  These APT attacks are thought to have begun in late winter. It is said to be using harmful software known as WellMess and WellMail. In the announcement, made alongside counterparts from the US and Canada, the NCSC said yesterday: “APT’s malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.” Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said: “The reported actions of Russian intelligence services should be con­demned. Labour is committed to working with the Government to protect national security and  safeguard institutions from foreign interference, none more so than those leading the international effort to develop a Covid- vaccine.” She urged Mr Raab to provide MPs with “concrete steps that will be taken to protect the UK” from cyber attacks. The Government has confirmed that a vaccine created in Britain would be there to protect people here and across the world. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who chaired Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee until December, said Russia has been trying to hack systems and “spread disinformation” for a long time. He called the country a “serial offender”. Russian news agency Tass cited a Kremlin spokesman as saying Russia had nothing to do with the attacks.

The reality is that Google Ads is awash with scammers, so much so that I would actively discourage anyone seeking savings advice from using the search engine. Amfeix is showing worrying signs of being another disastrous example. It claims to be a bank where you can deposit Bitcoin and earn interest of % a month, which works out at an unlikely annual rate of %.

One customer who deposited . Bitcoin, worth about £,, told me: “Amfeix is advertised heavily online and I was looking for an investment opportunity. “Now I am deeply worried because no withdrawals are possible.” Jack Hudson, , was named on its website as the director of what, so far as I can tell, is its only incorporated business, Amfeix Enterprise Tradings Ltd, registered in the UK. That was until he resigned in May, leaving the company with no directors, and it is now listed as due to be struck off the Companies House register. Amfeix would not tell me who now runs the operation, despite repeated requests in which I finally emailed: I donapost understand why you wonapost answer my simple questions, no legitimate business would object to being asked for its company registration and directorsapos details. I also find it rather unprofessional that your replies have no name or postal address. This is not very transparent.The Amfeix Twitter account has only vaguely addressed the question of blocked customer withdrawals, saying: “Several key changes are being made behind the scenes for a long-lasting solution.”It’s all looking rather bleak for “The world’s largest and most trusted Bitcoin bank”.

The latest data suggests that the number of daily new cases has now stopped dropping, with a definite levelling off of cases since the beginning of July. The latest figures were based on the data from almost  million users and , swab tests done between  June to  July. The data does not include care homes. Experts from Kingaposs College London and health tech company ZOE say the numbers over the past few weeks appear to show that new cases in the UK have been increasing. However, the experts say the current estimate is still within the confidence intervals of previous estimates so any increase is not yet deemed signicant. The vast majority cases are from England , with Wales at  and Scotland  per day. The Midlands is the only region where daily new cases numbers are falling, according to the data. The latest prevalence figures estimate that , people in the UK currently have symptomatic Covid. The Midlands is still showing the highest number of predicted cases, but the numbers have been decreasing over the last few weeks suggesting that the localised lockdown in Leicester could be responsible. However, for regions like the North East and Yorkshire the predicted numbers still remain higher than others. Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, warned the virus is not going away anytime soon.   He said: “After months of seeing the number of Covid cases falling in the UK, we are now seeing those numbers bottom out. We aren’t surprised to see this happening given the easing of lockdown and more and more people working and socialising. The team is keeping a very close eye on the data in order to allow us to spot any potential new hotspots and pick up regions with a signicant increase. The virus is not going away any time so it is really important that people are adhering to the public health messages around social distancing, washing hands, and wearing masks.

To make matters worse, the once-beautul building, which has a leaking roof, was targeted by vandals, who ripped up paving and smashed windows. An estimated £, is needed to restore the “Stute” – Cefn Fforest Miners’ Welfare Hall and Institute – to what was its former glory. Committee member Marina Chacon-Dawson said: “It isn’t in a very good state but some of the features are incredible. “We’d love to restore the feature window on the staircase and the front door had an archway that needs replacing, it was gorgeous. “It used to be a brilliant building and it needs to be saved.

We have teamed up with the Pride of Britain fund to give away £, to community projects –  organisations will each get £,, while  good causes will each receive £,. The entries are pouring in from youth clubs, support groups, food and baby banks, small charities and more. The Friends group was set up a couple of years ago by locals in Caerphilly, South Wales. Marina, who has a degree in psychology, said they are hoping it can be transformed into a community hub focussing on wellbeing. “We already have a community centre and a leisure centre but we haven’t got a wellbeing centre. Residents seemed to love it,” she said. “We want to enhance existing facilities in the local community and improve people’s wellbeing. “Ideas include yoga, meditation, craft classes, a radio suite and baby clinic. Occupational courses will help people find the right job for them.” Miners’ institutes were once the focus of working class communities, serving as libraries and reading rooms and a place of recreation. Pit closures swept the UK but many “Stutes” were later revived to serve a dferent purpose. The Cefn Fforest Miners’ Institute is described by ex-miner Nat Thomas as being “one of the best in South Wales” in its heyday. Built by money granted by the Miners’ Welfare Fund, it was completed in . The Friends have applied for ­charitable status and are bidding to take over the lease for the building, which is owned by the local council. “We want it restored with many of its original features,” said Marina. “It’s too beautul for us to lose – it can help us improve the community for everybody.” Apply today for community cash boost "},{"url":null,"title":"how stop glasses steaming compulsory","story":"NewsHow to stop glasses steaming as compulsory face masks in shops to be introducedWhile the measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus is a basic way of keeping as many people safe as possible, those who wear glasses frequently find that their glasses steam up as warm breath is forced upwards and meets the colder glass surfaceShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyNeil Shaw:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsPeople who routinely wear glasses are finding the wearing of masks a little inconvenient \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here. Make sure your mask fits snugly A tightly fitting mask is the first thing that you need to check for. Not only does this help to keep you protected against any airborne particles, but it also stops too much breath from escaping and fogging your lenses. For the best fit, your mask should be snug against your nose and cheeks, and there shouldn’t be any slack or gaps for the air to escape. If your mask is not tight enough when you first put it on, try tightening the straps for a secure fit or opting for a smaller size. . Secure the mask around your nose Securing your mask around your nose is another way to limit the amount of breath that escapes upwards. Try moving your mask further up your noseand resting your glasses on top of it to help seal the mask. If this does not work, or your mask cannot be pulled this high, try using a small piece of surgical tape to secure the mask to the bridge of your nose. This helps form a seal to prevent your breath from escaping upwards.  . Think your mask is too big  Tighten it with the ear loops If your mask doesn’t fit tightly, you can try adjusting it yourself. If you have enough slack in the ear loops, try twisting them into an ‘X’ shape and then putting them around your ears. With the self-tying face masks, you can adjust it yourself so that the mask fits closer to your face — just make sure you don’t tie them so tight that you get red marks behind your ears. . Stop your glasses from slipping down your nose Glasses constantly slipping down your nose can be a pain, so why not try wrapping the string of the mask around the sides of your glasses rather than your ear. This might help to make your glasses and mask more secure — just be careful when taking off your glasses as the mask will be attached. It might be that your glasses are slipping down because your frames are not fitting you as well as they did, this can happen over time as we use them day in and day out - they may simply need adjusting. If so, just call your local Specsavers opticians and we’ll be able to adjust them for you, though at the moment this may be by appointment only.  . Breathe downwards into the mask Instead of fiddling with your mask and trying to adjust it, you might find that changing your breathing helps just as well. To prevent your glasses from steaming up, try to push the air downwards when you exhale. It might take a bit of getting used to, but once you’ve got the hang of it, it’s a pretty simple solution. . Clean your lenses It might be that your lenses are prone to foggingit’s been a while since they had a good clean. We suggest using a cloth and cleaning spray, or,they’re particularly dirty or smeared, put a small drop of washing-up liquid on the lenses and rub lightly with your fingers. Then rinse them with warmwater and gently dry with a soft tissue.

Sophie Richardson who was looking forward to rebuilding her le after her le-changing surgery - but found herself back in hospital with the virus just four weeks after being discharged from a -week lockdown inpatient stay. The -year-old was admitted to Hull Royal Infirmary with a leg wound infection following a double amputation, where she underwent a test for Covid-. After the positive result, Sophie was immediately transferred onto a covid ward where her condition deteriorated.She is now on and off four litres of oxygen per day and described the pain as being like having someone sat on her chest, reports Hull Live. Her dedicated mum, Nikki Burton, , of Willerby said she wanted to warn people the virus has not gone away after the shock of her daughter contracting it whilst she has been isolating. She said: For those who think that Covid has passed and everything is back to normal, it is far from it.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereThis virus is still very active and amongst us all acting silently and discreetly. Covid does not discriminate. It is not fussy about what colour your skin is, whether youaposre rich or poor, what race or religion you are or the political views you hold. Covid isnapost particular and nobody is exempt. This is one thing where everybody is in the same boat! The scary thing is Sophie hasnapost travelled on public transport or been for a drink in the local pub. Neither has she been shopping, out for lunch or cuddled up to anyone. In fact she hasnapost ventured out in public at all and has been totally isolating from the outside world. Whilst rehabilitating at home after her double leg amputations, she has been shielding with carers who have been wearing face masks. They have been thorough with hygiene and hand sanitising but this virus has still managed to strike another victim. Sophie is now in a room on her own on a Covid ward in hospital whilst the nurses and doctors work extremely hard to try and win this new battle we face.Sophieaposs health problems began when she was  and studying for a PhD in Counter Terrorism at the University of Hull. She began to suffer with back problems which led to surgery in .Initially, Sophie was able to start physio - but six months later began having seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy.  She would often drop to the floor asher legs had been kicked out from beneath her and her knees would constantly dislocate causing excruciating pain. Having been backwards and forwards to hospital many times, in January this year it was decided Sophie could not live with the pain of the dislocations and a double amputation was necessary.The operation was then cancelled eight times due to coronavirus, but finally she was able to have the amputation in March, and following that was finally able to sit up for the first time in years.After ing home, Sophie went back into hospital for treatment for an infection in her wound and tested positive for Covid- before being transferred to the Covid ward. Her mum added: That’s whataposs scary, thataposs whataposs knocked me for six, itaposs more contagious than you think. Sophie hasn’t mixed with anyone.

The cluster has been linked to a private gathering at a home in Limavady, Northern Ireland. Testing and contact tracing is already underway to try to track down everyone who maybe infected with the virus. The PHA said: The Public Health Agency has identied a cluster of Covid- cases in the Limavady area. At present we can link the cases to a social gathering in a private residential setting. Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased, this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. The PHA said it will continue to monitor all cases of Covid-, look for trends and linked cases and advise or inform the public of any increased risk to health. It added: We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.  We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. Thataposs why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important.

They claim a “new iety” is emerging in the cities of Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester. Younger, middle-class people now use a “general northern English” dialect, which makes it harder to distinguish what area they are from. A University of Manchester team found that while some accent features had vanished, people still used short vowels in words like “glass” and “bath”. They also suggested that prejudice against accents was in decline. Linguistics expert Dr Patrycja Strycharczuk said: “It may seem as though local accents are dying out but we believe we’re actually seeing a new iety becoming established – educated, urban and northern. Its prestige has increased and people are now less tempted to lose their accentthey’ve been to university or do a lot of public speaking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrews website suddenly vanishes","story":"NewsPrince Andrew’s website suddenly vanishes amid Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell scandalVisitors to Prince Andrews website are instead redirected to a page about the Duke of York on royal.uk as the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell scandal thunders onShareByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video prince-andrew-could-called-give-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news prince-andrews-website-suddenly-vanishes-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Duke of Yorkaposs site has suddenly vanished from site and visitors are being redirected to an official Royal Family page. This follows weeks of pressure on the -year-old prince after his former pal Maxwell was arrested and charged with alleged child sex abuse, sex trafficking of children and grooming. Prosecutors in the US began to again demand he travel to America to be questioned about what he knew of paedophile billionaire Epsteinaposs crimes. And now anyone trying to access thedukeofyork.org is now redirected to royal.uk, and the section about Andrew.  The Queenaposs third child stepped back from public duties in November , after a disastrous interview with BBC Newsnight over his links with Epstein. The royal.uk page begins by pointing this out and carries the statement the prince released at the time. The statement reads: I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.  His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.  Andrewaposs social media accounts, on Instagram and twitter, have not shared anything since November . Prince Andrew has vehemently denied any accusations of wrongdoing, including allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was  years old.  The FBI previously claimed Andrew had not helped them with the investigation into Jeffrey Epsteinaposs criminal behaviour with underage girls. But a source close to the dukeaposs working group said earlier this month that his lawyers have twice communicated with the US Department of Justicein the past month. The dukeaposs team remains bewildered given that we have twice communicated with the DOJ in the last month and to date we have had no response, the source said.  Andrewaposs contact with the FBI has been a source of tension for months. The Department of Justice in New York, which is leading the investigation into Epstein’s crimes, filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government. It is a bid to force the duke to supply a statement.  Andrew was yesterday seen for the first time since Ghislaine Maxwellaposs court appearance. The Duke of York seemed in a cheery mood when he was pictured beaming behind the wheel of his Range Rover. He appeared to be laughing with his bodyguard as he drove through the gates of Windsor Castle this morning.

It is the first time that the monarch - who has been isolating since the start of the lockdown - has made a public engagement since March . She was seen in public for the first time since lockdown on June  when she attended a stripped back Trooping the Colour. Captain Tom, who turned  in April, raised nearly £million for health service charities by walking laps of his Bedfordshire garden. He will travel with members of his family for the rare, special investiture with the monarch. Royal investitures were put on hold during the pandemic, and those scheduled to take place at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in June and July were postponed. But the -year-old Queen, who has been staying at Windsor since before lockdown for her safety, will carry out the official engagement in person - rare for the monarch during the pandemic - to honour Captain Tom. It is her first public appearance since Commonwealth Day, when she stood alongside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in one of the coupleaposs last frontline royal engagements. The monarch will use the sword that belonged to her father, George VI, and will present him with the insignia of Knight Bachelor.  The ceremony will take place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public. Members of the public are being asked not to attend Windsor town centre or gather in the hope of seeing any of the ceremony, which will not be visible from any external viewpoint. Captain Tom had set out to raise £,, but his incredible gesture won him fans around the world and saw his fundraising efforts soar. In honour of his incredible achievement, he was given a flypast on his th birthday.  Captain Tom also became the oldest person to ever score a UK Number One single with his rendition of Youaposll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices Of Care Choir. And his incredible efforts saw him awarded a special Pride Of Britain award. Captain Tom said the response to his charitable efforts had been outstanding. He said: Itaposs hard to describe thereaposs been so much kindness shown and so many people making kind remarks.

By Sunday, that frontal system should clear with generally drier, cooler weather across the whole country which will continue into Monday.BBC forecaster Darren Bett said temperatures are dropping away through the weekend with highs of C on Sunday a bit below par for this time of year. But Met Office charts show C in the south by Tuesday - though its long-range forecast shows any warmer weather will be short-lived until at least mid August.  Mr Dewhurst said despite the highs today in the south, Scotland will be a mixture of sunny spells and showers, with temperatures likely around C. Through Friday evening, this band of rain slowly pushes its way southwards a bit further into parts of Wales - perhaps fringing the Midlands at times.  While Saturday will be a grey start in northern England and Wales, with a frontal system staying across the central swathe of the UK through the day, bringing cloud and rain despite some warm temperatures. Showers could be heavy in Scotland and Northern Ireland tomorrow but the sunshine will hold on in the southeast before it falls more in line with the rest of the country on Sunday.

Niamh Hughes sobbed to her family donapost let them take me as she was jailed for more than three years. She appeared in court alongside friend Laura Albrektaite. The two girls launched their attack after their victim, Johnny Nath, threw Albrektaiteaposs shoes into the lake outside the popular Lakeside shopping centre as aposbanterapos.He was punched to the ground by a male friend of the two girls before they repeatedly kicked him in the head, Essex Live reports.Since the attack Mr Nath, has lost his sense of smell, canapost eat solid foods and is often askedhe has had a stroke due to the permanent damage caused. The attack was captured on CCTV and Hughes even took a photo of Mr Nath, lying on the ground and covered in his own blood, before leaving the scene. At a sentencing hearing at Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday, prosecuting barrister Cyrus Shroff told the court that rather than walking away, Albrektaite, who was  at the time, and Hughes, , started to kick him repeatedly in the head. When they eventually stopped their attack, Hughes ed and took an image of Mr Nath lying on the floor. When the girls were stopped by security, Albrektaite, of Shannon Way, Aveley, reportedly asked them to let her go as it could aposruin her leapos. The pair were both arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm at the scene, later pleading guilty.  Mr Nath canapost remember the chronology of events from the evening, the court was told. In a statement read out to the court, he said that he had been on a night out and was waiting for a friend to pick him up. The next thing he remembers is a friend standing over him saying that he needed to go to hospital. A security officer at Lakeside found Mr Nath lying on the floor with blood apospouringapos from his nose and mouth. In total, he suffered in excess of  facial fractures, including both eye sockets, his cheek bones, jaw and skull.  The court heard he has been left with blurred vision, ringing in his ears and he has lost his sense of smell and his jaw is misaligned. He said: I need this to stop. Itaposs dficult to live with. I have a lack of self confidence, I donapost like people near my face or looking at my face.  People askI have had a stroke. I hate the face I have, I donapost recognise it in the mirror. Mr Nath also described how he gets flashbacks of the attack and how he has been driven to drinking and smoking more than he used to. Both defendants and their families cried while watching CCTV of the attack. Representing Albrektaite, Michael Warren re-iterated that his client was just  at the time of the attack. He told Judge Lodge about domestic trouble in her le since she was young, however said that she accepted responsibility for what she did.  He said: She is going in to this term of punishment in the hope she can emerge better for it. She understands that she needs to suffer because of the events. She feels embarrassed for what she did to the victim and the long-standing impact this will have on her.

Instead under Vladimir Putin, Russia has become a rogue state, waging a new form of war against The West. It stands accused of undermining sovereign nations through cyber hacking, espionage and spreading misinformation. The charge sheet includes the Salisbury poisonings, interfering in the US elections, sabotaging a French TV station and cyber attacks on the German parliament. We can now add to that shameful list the targeting of UK institutions trying to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. The security services deserve credit for foiling this latest attack. Russia could have joined the effort to find a cure for Covid-. But no. It has tried to secure possibly ground-breaking research by cheating. Putin and his corrupt regime have made their country an international outcast.  Put her on trial Shamima Begum left this country to join a terrorist cult that gloated at the slaughter of her fellow Britons. It is easy to understand the anger at the court’s decision to allow her back to contest the stripping of her citizenship. The fact she has shown no remorse adds to the outrage. But, like it or not, Ms Begum is our responsibility. She was just  when she flew to Syria having been indoctrinated here. However grim her actions she should be tried in a UK court. That is how Britain can show it values fair justice, unlike the regime she championed.

In November, his friend Dylon was stabbed at a party, later dying in hospital. Last weekend would have been Dylon’s th birthday. “I celebrated his birthday with friends and family,” Jermain says. “He would have been the same age as me. It’s had a huge impact on me. I didn’t realise how much at first.” Jermain has campaigned on youth violence since losing school friend Isaiah Ekpaloba to a kne attack months after winning ITV talent show, The Voice, in . “But this is a turning point,” he says. “I have lost so many friends now. I have to turn anger into action.” Today, Jermain chaired a UK-wide video meeting of over , young people to discuss the new Youth Violence Commission report by MPs – hearing a torrent of fears for the future. The report – which promotes a “public health approach” to tackling youth violence – is even more urgent since the Covid- emergency. ­Lockdown has exacerbated almost everything the report identies as preconditions for a surge in violence. The MP who set up the YVC after seeing a string of young people killed in her Lewisham Deptford constituency is no less worried. Vicky Foxcroft says: “We know from the report that domestic violence, poverty, inequality, bad housing, cuts to youth funding, gaps in education are all factors. “This has all got worse in the last weeks. We can’t ignore that being at home for some young people has been more dangerous than Covid-.”The report warns that funding for youth services and Violence Reduction Units in the UKis threatened by post-pandemic austerity cuts.Meanwhile, commission advisers also flagged up the ­deteriorating relationship between the police and BAME communities during lockdown. “There were over , stop and searches of black men between March and May,” Jermain says. “Over % led to no further action. “Yet Police Commissioner Cressida Dick recently said the Met is no longer ­institutionally racist. I’m calling on her to resign. “I honestly believeshe stays in her position, we can expect to see another uprising on our hands.” Jermain speaks from personal experience. “How many times have I been stopped and searched  How many times have you found pennies in your pocket  I’ve lost count. It’s just part of my le. “The first time I was stopped and searched, I was in my school unorm. I was pushed up against a shop window and asked: ‘What have you got on you ’ Nothing. The officer said: ‘I like to give you people a chance, so I’ll ask again…’ “The second time, I was getting a McDonald’s after college. There was something going on, so I walked past, and an officer grabbed me. ‘Where do you think you’re going ’ he said. One of the boys they were arresting had to tell them, ‘he’s not actually with us’.  “Why did they think I was  Because of the colour of my skin. It’s making me emotional because this is the experience of so many black and brown people in London.” After apologising to Team GB sprinter Bianca Williams for a stop and search that saw her dragged and handcuffed in front of her child, Dame Cressida told MPs last week: “I don’t think we’re collectively failing. “I don’t think [racism] is a massive systemic problem, I don’t think it’s institutionalised, and more to the point I think we have come such a very, very, very long way.”Gary ­Trowsdale, lead adviser to the Commission and former MD of the Damilola Taylor Trust, says he’s seen “disproportionate targeting of the black community lead to the worst community-police ­relations since the s. “This is just as the poorest communities are coming to terms with the death toll affecting them worse than others. Hospital cleaners, porters and bus drivers are the families and neighbours of the kids being stopped and search day in, day out.”  Jermain adds: “Covid has discriminated – not the virus itself, but the way it behaved, the way it exploited structural racism.” The cross-party MPs’ report looks at youth violence as a disease, building on a model successfully pioneered in Scotland. The murder rate in Glasgow dropped dramatically when police started to treat communities with compassion, and to treat the causes of the epidemic. It also cost the public purse far less.In the wake of Covid-, Vicky Foxcroft sees a chance for change. “ Coronavirus shows we can react to a public health emergency when we want to,” she says."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who won prizes worth","story":"NewsWoman who won prizes worth £, says comping addiction took over her leRebecca Beesley, , scooped huge cash prizes and a string of amazing money-cant-buy experiences - but said said the highs of have been matched with desperate lowsShareCommentsByWilliam JanesLydia Chantler-Hicks:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsRebecca Beesley has won prizes worth over £, - but at a price \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Rebecca Beesley, ,  scooped huge cash prizes and a string of amazing money-canapost-buy experiences - but said said the highs of have been matched with desperate lows. The mum-of-three found herself skipping showers and meals - glued to her computer for hours on end, scouring the internet for chances to win. But now sheaposs back on an even keel, she also wants to share the good times she still has with comping. Rebecca first caught the comping bug when she was strapped for cash but needed a buggy for her daughter. She said: I didnapost have many opportunities growing up - Iaposm from a single-parent household and quite a poor background. As a child Iaposd see things advertised on food wrappers and think aposwow, people can win cars and thingsapos. My comping started when my daughter was born in . I needed a stroller, so was entering every competition for buggies I could find - then I won one. I was home-schooling my boys then, and in the evenings I started entering competitions as a way of unwinding. Between  and , Rebecca, from Tonbridge, Kent, won a staggering £, worth of prizes - including about £, of holidays, along with smaller items like baby equipment, books, and cosmetics. But with the winning came a buzz, which Rebecca now says was helping with the lows of grief and post-natal depression, and the hobby began to grow out of hand. She said: I think thereaposs underlying stuff going on. I know in my case it was an issue with grief and loss that came to the fore around the same time and comping was my way of escaping that. When I lost my mum, which was some time ago, I kind of covered up the grief and I didnapost let myself grieve properly. I thought aposIaposm ok, Iaposll get through this, itaposll be okapos and I didnapost let myself have any grief. Then a when friend had a loss around the time I was into my comping I found it really hard to deal with because it brought back all of my memories of my own grief. Comping was the thing I went on to because I thought thataposs where I can get a happy feeling from winning something. Youaposre getting that little sense of validation and that little buzz and it became my way of getting through each day. My daughter was very young then and so I think there was some post-natal depression mixed in as well so I think thereaposs a whole loads of thing bubbling together which led to it becoming that extreme. At her lowest points, Rebecca was neglecting herself to chase the high - searching Facebook and competition websites.She said: It becomes a vicious circle. If you start getting wins, it can be hard to see a competition and not enter. I had a bad spell when Iaposd enter everything I could find on Facebook. The next night, Iaposd spend about five hours just going through the previous dayaposs competitions to check there was nothing Iaposd won and missed. At one point during her early comping years, Rebecca was winning a prize every day, on average but she confessed I was probably the unhappiest Iaposve ever been in my le. I was actually skipping showers, skipping meals, just to get in a few more competitions. It had become like a proper addiction. It feels wrong to compare it to alcohol or drug addiction because there arenapost the same physical consequences. But in terms of my mental health, it was my way of getting through the day. I was living for those little buzzes of those emails pinging in saying aposyouaposve won, youaposve wonapos. It was a really dficult time for me. Thankfully, Rebecca has bounced back. While she still plays and wins competitions regularly, she said she has now aposfound a balance.apos She said: I donapost gamble with money but its time I lose, its time with my family and time that I would be spending with my kids so Iaposm conscious of trying to keep that balance. Before it just became really dficult to switch off from the aposcompsapos knowing they were there. Now I just think the competitions are always going to be there, you might miss one or two or several hundred even but they will be there, there will be more competitions in the future, it doesnapost matter.  I have kind of got that sense of perspective again which at the time was really hard. Iaposm probably now doing half-an-hour to an hour a day, but it ies. Rebecca finds contests run by brands she follows on social media, and uses competition listing site The Prize Finder. She says her favourite competitions are creative ones, which take time and thought to enter. She said: The stand-out one for me was winning a Black Tower wine competition, to create a new bottle design. I just did a quick hand drawing, and it won. I loved seeing the bottles in supermarkets. I was so surprised to win - it shows itaposs always worth having a go. But creative entries like videos or building something out of cardboard can take days. When leaposs busy Iaposll just do form-fill entries, or ones where you tag friends. Some competitions are pure luck. At the beginning of this year I won a random draw for a £ cheque from White Stuff. Thereaposs something for everyone in this hobby. Rebecca and her family have enjoyed countless money-canapost-buy experiences, thanks to comping. She said: Last November we won an all-inclusive holiday to Mexico. It was just a lovely break. Back in  my husband won us a holiday to Dubai. It was so special. Theyaposve also won trips to places including Alton Towers, Center Parcs, and Wales. Before the pandemic, they had two stays in Cornwall and a holiday in Milan lined up - all competition prizes. Rebecca has even used comping as part of her sonsapos learning, during home-schooling.  She said: Iaposd find competitions for them to enter - like story-writing. My son loved to cook, and won a cookery competition where we got to have afternoon tea with Mary Berry. Rebecca dislikes the term professional comper, instead describing herself as a competition enthusiast. She said: You couldnapost earn a living out of it because you canapost guarantee whataposs coming. I know some people sell their prizes, but I only enter for things I need, orI know someone who needs it.

Devin Kandaaposs rapid reaction to the sudden appearance of the big fish possibly saved his le as he sailed off Diamond Head on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The heart-stopping -second clip shows Devin with his legs shin-deep in the ocean before a angry-looking fin comes out of nowhere towards him. He quickly lts his feet out of the way into the safety of the kayak a split second before the shark swims under the vessel. This forces him to hold on to the kayak with both hands or face being capsized into the deadly sharkaposs reach. Devin commented on YouTube about his close encounter. He said: “A tiger shark came in looking for a bite while I was securing a fish in my fish bag. “Luckily, I saw it in time to pull my feet out of the water before it had a chance to bite my foot off.”The lucky fisherman told Hawaii News Now he was storing a fish he’d just caught when he glimpsed something out of the corner of his eye before he realised it was a shark.“I just saw this mass coming toward me. I thought it was another kayak,” he told the station.“This thing is so massive... You can see the camera, it shakes a little because its head was right under the kayak rubbing against it.” Kanda recorded the jaw-dropping moment with a GoPro mounted to the kayak and the clip has been viewed more than , times since it was uploaded on YouTube.

The exception is where they are accompanying a child with additional support needs for whom this would, for example, limit communication or cause distress.With , pupils # one in five # entitled to free transport, Fe has the highest number of schoolchildren travelling by bus and uses  buses.Head of education with Fe Council, Shelagh McLean, said: #Arrangements are well advanced for pupil transport and a number of scenarios are being worked on.#Fe, like other local authorities, has been liaising with the Scottish Government on some operational matters, however we will work through the new guidance to ensure that we are fully compliant.#However, there are some children who use service buses, who may be advised not to do so.Carrie Lindsay, executive director of education and children’s services, told councillors the authority was still working with the government on this issue but said: #Where young people maybe use a service bus and use a pass because it’s a non-entitled transport then we think that the advice will have to be that they would not use those buses because we couldn’t guarantee that they would be able to get on the buses.“We’ve already been encouraging our parents to think about how children can walk to school, cycle to school, use their scooters.”Perthshire has the highest proportion of youngsters # one in four # bussed to school, with , entitled to transport.It is understood Perth and Kinross Council asked parents at the end of last term whether they were able to drive children to school.Kinross High School parent Fiona Stewart, of Kinnesswood, said she and fellow parents nearby were worried about transportShe said: #Both my boys get the bus to school, we live in a rural village.#I was concerned, I have to say. My children are entitled to get the school bus.#There might have been days we could take them to school but because we#re working we couldn#t pick them up.#I know there will be parents saying this is terrible, they need to socially distance, but I don#t think they do.#My kids have not been shielding, they don#t have any health concerns.#In Dundee almost % and in Angus almost % of pupils take the school bus.Drivers on public, and to a lesser extent school, transport were said to be at a higher risk of exposure and must be protected from airborne and surface transmission.The advice states that installations such as protective barriers and screens for the drivers may be appropriate, based on assessments by operators and licensing authorities, and drivers should wash or sanitise their hands regularly.It is understood there are concerns among operators for pupils who rely on service rather than dedicated school buses.Paul White, director of the Confederation of Passenger Transport Scotland, said: #CPT remains in discussions with the Scottish Government and local authorities regarding the provision of home to school transport.#Given how soon schools will reopen it is critical we reach a quick understanding as to how today’s published advice impacts upon the practicalities of operating both dedicated school transport and school children travelling on registered buses.#The safety of school children, bus users and drivers is paramount.#Stagecoach East Scotland, which is contracted to provide a number of school bus services in Tayside and Fe, said it was in discussion with local authorities and awaited further guidance.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that. It is definitely exciting times.”Former Rangers and Dunfermline man Clark was a key component of the Tangerines’ Championship title winning squad from last term.He is now hoping Mellon gives him and the other medal winners a chance to prove they can do it in the Premiership.Clark added: “The boys were excellent last season and we deservedly won the league although it wasn’t the way we wanted it to be.“At the end of the day we are champions and it is good to hear the manager will give us a chance.“However, we all know that he will bring in some new faces and over the next few days and weeks because he will want to strengthenthere are areas where he feels he needs to strengthen.“We will have to work hard and keep strivingwe want to keep raising the standards to meet the challenge of the Premiership week in, week out.”Clark ed from six months out with an ankle injury in a - friendly defeat at Motherwell on Saturday.It wasn’t the result the Terrors were after but the former Queen of the South man was just delighted to get back on the pitch.He commented: “It was a good run out. It has been a long time coming for me because it was my first game since January but it was good to get out there and going again.“It was exciting to be back playing again. I could have been backthe season hadn’t been cut short but this extra time has given me more opportunity to get everything % right and a good pre-season behind me.“It was a mix of experienced boys and younger lads but it was a good game.“We got beat - but at this stage it is all about fitness and boys coming through injury free.“The boys have all come back flying.

Derek has brought to the club a consistency that we haven’t seen in well over a generation.“Aberdeen are really fortunate to have him as their manager, in particular at this point in time.“For me he is up there as one of the great managers of recent times.”In his seven years at Pittodrie McInnes has delivered the  League Cup and reached a further three cup finals.Aberdeen have qualied for Europe for seven successive seasons. Former chief executive Fraser was pivotal in helping the club eliminate all debt in .Six years ago an investment deal and restructuring wiped out the club’s net debt of £. million.Fraser believes being debt free was vital to help McInnes’ ambitions for the club.It also put the club in a stronger position as the coronavirus pandemic hit, despite projected losses of £m due to the Covid- outbreak.Fraser said: “Itdid help. The club has not got money coming in and we have challenging times.“CertainlyAberdeen hadn’t been in the strong financial position it was then things would have been an awful lot harder.“Being debt free was a fundamental to taking the club forward and helping the board work with Derek about where he could strengthen the squad.“We concluded that deal about a year-and-a-half after Derek arrived. It definitely helped being able to assist him more than we were able to do.”Fraser also recognised the contribution of former Scotland boss Craig Brown who was appointed manager in December  with the Reds bottom of the table.Brown and assistant Archie Knox led them to safety and also built foundations for future years.Fraser said: “Craig was able to bring real stability at the club and his work for that two-and-a-half years should always be recognised.”Fraser has also served on the boards of the SPL, SPFL and Scottish FA.He joined the SFA board in July last year having previously served as a member of the Professional Game Board.In recent months, Fraser has been a co-chair of the joint response group’s medical subgroup along with Dr John MacLean and has played a key role in helping Scottish football recover andfrom the impact of the outbreak.Fraser will officially step down from his role as non-executive board member with the SFA following the annual general meeting on Wednesday.He said: “In terms of getting players back to training and being in the position to demonstrate to the government that games could be played from August  it has been a huge undertaking.“John MacLean and medical people from ious Scottish sports institutes have been working very closely with the government behind the scenes to move this forward.”Fraser will officially step down at Pittodrie next week to begin a new career path with UEFA.He said: “I will be working through UEFA Grow with football federations throughout Europe to assist in their strategic planning and vision going forward to ensure we protect the game for future generations in a sustainable way.“This really fits the bill in terms of being involved with national associations and being able to put my experience to good use as we move forward.”Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack paid tribute to Fraser for almost two decades’ service.Cormack said: “I am grateful to Duncan for his time and dedication throughout his career at AFC.“Duncan has not only given his expertise to Aberdeen but in recent times also held an important role as a non-executive director at the Scottish FA.“As co-chair of the medical and player welfare committee, his experience has been beneficial in enabling us to get back training. We wish him all the best.”Former Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne said: “In the  years Duncan and I worked together, his counsel and loyalty were unwavering.“He helped the club achieve many of our key objectives, ultimately playing a central role in negotiating the deal that eliminated our debt.”Scottish FA interim president Mike Mulraney said: “Duncan’s experience as a chief executive and, more recently, non-executive director at Aberdeen has been hugely valuable to the Scottish FA beyond his year spent as a board member.“He has been a colleague and friend for many years and I know he will be a success in his new role .”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The Argyll and Bute Climate Change group challenged me to make sure that I didn’t get into the habit of seeing this as a single issue but rather one that impacts absolutely everything I do at Westminster, from economic recovery planning, to defence and security, human rights and international affairs.#If there is a silver lining to this awful COVID- pandemic it is that going forward, we can do things dferently as iniduals, as a country, internationally and of course, globally. And its an opportunity we must take.#Mr O#Hara referenced the group and their meeting on the floor of the House of Commons the following day, when he asked the Secretary of State for Transport about the group#s dismay that #once again the UK Government had missed almost every one of on its emissions targets#.#We are very fortunate that our MP Brendan O’Hara understands the urgency of the climate crisis, and is open to some of our suggestions,# said -year-old Rowan Aitchison.He continued: #We desperately need to retire GDP as a measure of our wellbeing and work towards a system that allows people to live a fulfilling le. Scotland is one of very few countries that have made a start on this, pioneering a government system which is based on a wellbeing economy.

unavailability of face masks for his family, as he faced the Covid- lockdown with a pregnant we and his dad in a high-risk category.Hass, who had previously set up a global video business, Volcano City, that saw him work with likes of footballer Neymar and pop superstar Katie Perry, spent  weeks researching the market before launching his #sasMASK brand from home, in the midst of the national lockdown.He had been looking after his four-year-old son Otto as a stay-at-home dad and living with his parents in Colinton, Edinburgh, while his home in Musselburgh was being renovated when lockdown kicked in.Their family business, making greetings cards and gts, based in premises at Newhailes Industrial Estate in Musselburgh, was also closed due to the lockdown restrictions.Hass, a member of

decided we did.ldquoI started shopping for good-quality masks that didnrsquot compromise the medical PPE supply chain.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"author-patrick-baker-five-scotlands-evocative-wild-places","story":"THERE are certain places that exist at the edge of our collective memory. Ruins and relics which are scattered across Scotlandrsquos landscape, forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness. I have come to think of them best described as wild histories. Wild, certainly, in that they are located in wilderness areas, but wild also in an almost anthropomorphic sense: feral, uncared for, mostly unknown or nameless, and outside the boundaries of public consciousness.When thought of in this way, the landscape of Scotland becomes a vast diorama: the setting for countless narrative scenes, lives and stories overlaid, some more vivid than others. These wild but often unseen histories define us more than any iconic building or national monument, for they are records of things inconsequential and commonplace. It is this compelling and contradictory mixture of secrecy and signicance that over the years some has led me to become fascinated with some particular wild places.THE GLEN LOIN CAVES, SUCCOTHAlthough I cannot say when or how I first became aware of the Glen Loin Caves, it feels like they have always been there, hard-wired into my imagination. Most people will never have heard of them, but I have come to think of them in near-mythical terms ndash a place of refuge for drovers, brigands, outlaws and even royalty.Among other claims, they were most famously the supposed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his routed army in  after his defeat at the Battle of Methven. More recently, the maze of fallen rocks on this Argyll mountainside was the focal point of a unique, sporting counterculture.It was here for almost two decades from the s that groups of working-class young people, mainly from the poverty-stricken tenements of Glasgow and shipyards of Clydebank, congregated to climb the huge rock walls of the Arrochar Alps.They created an almost permanent weekend residence in the caves. Small groups arrived at first, each with its own particular rules and hierarchies, then more established affiliations evolved. Clubs formed here whose names still resonate with modern mountaineers: the Ptarmigan Club and the infamous Creagh Dhu. The influence of these pioneering climbers was immense, providing a surge in climbing standards and techniques that was unequalled anywhere  at the time. They also redefined the sport, dismantling existing class barriers and creating a makesht society in the Glen Loin Caves whose values and ethics became imprinted on generations of climbers that were to follow.Yet the caves and their whereabouts have managed to remain largely unknown for decades. Hidden partly by the obscurity of the landscape, but also by an unwritten code of fraternal discretion.lsquoThe lad with the clinker-nailed boots and the rope in his rucksack who told me how to find the cave made me promise to keep the secret,rsquo wrote Alastair Borthwick in , in one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the caves.lsquoI was to follow a track to a foresterrsquos cottage, pass through a gate . . . and there search for an old sheep fank. Behind it I should find a faint track leading up the hillside andI followed the scratches on the rock it led to, I should find the cave and good company.rsquoEven at close proximity, however, the caves are frustratingly hard to locate. In  it took the writer Rennie McOwan, an accomplished outdoorsman, several attempts to pinpoint the exact position of Borthwickrsquos earlier description. lsquoYou can trace these historic cavesyou know where to lookrsquo, McOwan advised matter-of-factly, lsquobut it can be both time-consuming, and exasperatingyou do not.rsquoTHE NAVVIESrsquo GRAVEYARD, NEAR KINLOCHLEVENAt the start of the th century, in a remote glen in the West Highlands, thousands of navvies were at work on a huge hydroelectric scheme: a massive civil-engineering project near Kinlochleven, which included the construction of the reservoir, a six-kilometre aqueduct and an aluminium-smelting plant.For some of the men that worked there all the inherent danger of their job would suddenly coalesce in a single instant. With a sudden evaporation of luck ndash the misplaced sledgehammer blow, a momentrsquos loss of balance or the abrupt death-strike of unseen rock-fall ndash lives were ended in the wind-torn reaches of the moor.They were laid to rest near where they fell, in a small, improvised burial ground situated below the steep walls of the reservoir. This was the place that the author Patrick MacGill described in his radicalsemi-autobiographical novel Children of the Dead End ndash the navviesrsquo graveyard. It is still bleakly visible in the middle of the vast moor: three rows of headstones sectioned off by a low picket fence, the wood weathered to bone-grey.Even at a distance, its appearance is surreal. It has a strangely filmic quality: dramatic and out of place, like a set design ready to be used in a High Plains western. The gravestones, which were made with concrete from the dam, sit low in the ground, blotched with lichen and listing at angles in the soil.A few have been etched with simple decorative borders, and some carry names ndash all either Irish or Scottish. One in particular stands out, the grave of a woman, buried alongside the men. It challenges perceptions of the place as an exclusively male working environment. The thought of both men and women working here suggests perhaps something more civilised, than the lawless encampment described in MacGillrsquos book ndash a settlement or even a community.Despite the lack of embellishments, the inscriptions on the headstones are exact: neat letterings carved with considerable care. The same effort has been applied to all of them, including one ndash an anonymous grave ndash which, in the absence of a name, simply has the words lsquonot knownrsquo traced delicately across its centre. The gesture is touching. The stonemasonsrsquo precise work, their attention to detail and unbiased craftsmanship, even for an unidentied colleague, still feels like an act of considerable compassion.BELNAHUA, THE SLATE ISLESThe Slate Isles take their collective name from their geological renown. Fine-grained slate rock is found in abundance here in several rich deposits and has been mined since prehistoric times. By the th century the area was held in such importance it was mentioned by Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles, in his landmark account of the Western Isles.In the centuries that followed, small-scale mining evolved into massive commercial harvesting of the mineral resource. In , the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant recorded that slates of lsquomerchantable sizesrsquo were being exported in quantities of lsquoabout two million and a half . . . annually to England, Norway, Canada and the West Indiesrsquo.By the middle of the th century this number had grown as much as seven times, and the Slate Isles found themselves at the centre of a global industry, providing jobs to hundreds of workers and supplying roofing materials for buildings all around the world.All that, however, would change. A series of natural and economic calamities, beginning with a storm surge of epic proportions, rendered the mines unworkable and the area destitute. Large swathes of the population left, never to , and the land assumed a look of devastation, houses abandoned and machinery left to rust.The most beguiling of all the islands is the uninhabited Belnahua, the furthest outlier in the small archipelago. A ghost village now exists there rows of empty workersrsquo cottages that still look out over the slate quarry which has long since flooded to form a deep, stilled lagoon.I journeyed there by sea-kayak across some of Scotlandrsquos fastest tidal races, making landfall in front of hollow-eyed buildings with window and door spaces showing light-filled interiors.The best view comes from climbing up a prism-shaped knoll in the middle of the island. From up high you can see the structures that once housed the small community. As well as the terraced workersrsquo cottages, there are a scattering of other buildings: pump houses and engine rooms, coal sheds and outhouses. On the eastern side are two more substantial-looking buildings ndash a two-storey house and a bothy.What is most remarkable though is the slate mine itself now a single flooded quarry of dark water that fills the centre of the island like an ink well. The gouged area is so large that in places only a narrow boundary of land has been left to buffer against the sea.EL ALAMEIN REFUGE, THE CAIRNGORMSNo other mountain area in the British Isles can claim to have had such a large proleration of bothies and high-level shelters as the Cairngorms. By the mid-s, a constellation of these refuges existed across the range, providing a basic form shelter for climbers and mountaineers to overnight on their expeditions in and around the plateau.The names of the old Cairngorm sheltershave always held an undeniable mystique for me. They seem redolent of a bygone, pioneering era of mountaineering. A time, it seemed, when enthusiasm and exuberance appeared to outweigh adversity and a lack of proper equipment.Most of the shelters have long since disappeared: Bob Scottrsquos Bothy destroyed by fire, Jeanrsquos Hut, and the Sinclair Hut run into dereliction or dismantled the Curran and the St Valery demolished. There is one, however, that has for the most part been largely forgotten about. Situated at over , feet somewhere on the steep western flank of Strath Nethy, the El Alamein hut is dficult to find, it walls constructed entirely from rocks barely visible amid a hillside of boulders.The positioning of the El Alamein refuge was a mistake. It was never intended to be built on the northern spur of Cairn Gorm Mountain, tucked literally out of sight and notionally out of mind in a rarely ventured-to part of the Cairngorms. The story goes that its placement was a navigational error. Built by members of st Highland Division and named after one their most famous battles, a mix-up in grid references lead to its construction not on the high plateau, like its sister hut the St Valery, but on an incidental ridgeline.In , the El Alamein and the other two high-level shelters of the Cairngorm plateau became implicated in the Feith Buidhe disaster ndash to this day, the worst, single tragedy in British mountaineering history. Following recommendations of the subsequent fatal accident enquiry, a decision was made to remove of all three of the shelters. Their presence on the plateau was deemed an unacceptable risk. Notoriously hard to locate, it was thought they created a  sense of security, inviting the inexperienced and unprepared to rely unrealistically on finding their protection ndash an often impossible task in winter.After several years of highly publicised and emotive debate, two of the shelters were pulled down. But for whatever reason, the El Alamein never followed suit. Its obscurity and lack of purpose perhaps became the reason for its survival: a barely known mountain refuge, located high on a quiet ridgeline, where it remains to this day.INCHKEITH ISLAND, FIRTH OF FORTHBlack and brooding in the Firth of Forth, Inchkeith Island is easily seen, but often overlooked. I have flown over it many times. On homeward-bound planes which bank low over the coast, you get a gullrsquos eye view of the island.It gives you the chance to survey its complex, post-apocalyptic townscape: deserted roads and decaying buildings, greenery threading through concrete, shrubs emerging from the rubble. Itrsquos a contradictory but compelling mix. A strange scene of urban dereliction in an elemental and unconnected place.That the architecture and edices of dferent times could still exist so forgotten and untouched, yet so geographically close to Scotlandrsquos capital, seems paradoxical, but also makes perfect sense. For centuries, Inchkeithrsquos wild form and isolated position ndash a craggy, kilometre-long, hill-topped rock in the wide, storm-blasted waters of the Forth ndash has both alternatingly defined its importance and rendered it a landscape that can easily be cast aside.Over the centuries it has served a multitude of purposes. Fortress, garrison, farm, lazaretto, prison, religious settlement and even the venue for a bizarre linguistic experiment. As backstories go, it can certainly claim an eventful and troubled past, and more than conforms to the writer Patrick Barkhamrsquos contention that lsquoa few square miles of island loom far larger than the equivalent pocket of land on the mainlandrsquo.The same is also true for the other islands scattered in the Forth, the lsquoemeralds chased in goldrsquo of Walter Scottrsquos epic poem Marmion. Each, I have found out, have their own rich narratives, outsized stories that are much bigger than their contained landmasses would suggest. They are tales of human and natural history ndash warfare and piracy, extinction and regeneration ndash that are intimately entwined with the lives of people far beyond their immediate watery domains.One of Inchkeithrsquos most interesting histories involves its role as a staging post for an attempted invasion of Leith. On  September, a flotilla of privateer warships had reached Inchkeith Island and lay anchored off its shores waiting to attack the port. The small fleet was led by the infamous naval commander John Paul Jones, a Scot by birth who had joined the Continental Navy of the American Colonies and was wreaking havoc around Britainrsquos coastline. Jones was about to mount his offensive when he was suddenly stopped by an unexpected and ferocious storm. Leith was spared by the skin of its teeth, marking a curious historic footnote ndashperhaps the only time Scotland has ever been close to invasion by a military force of what would become the United States.The Unremembered Places: Exploring Scotlandrsquos Wild Histories by Patrick Baker is out now Follow @WildHistorianAs Scotlandrsquos wild places become accessible again, enthusiasm to discover wild histories should always be accompanied by the principle of lsquoleaving no tracersquo: please tread lightly, leave no litter, do not disturb historical relics and respect Scotlandrsquos natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Hurrah  The pubs are reopening     here  39 s why I love even the worst of them","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

One broiling summerrsquos day my husband, having trekked what felt like the entire Southern Upland Way, finally reached its doors.

When he began babbling his gratitude, and describing the arduousness of his passage over the hills, she cut him short. ldquoNobody told you to do it, she said.The British tradition of outrageously hostile hospitality stretches back long before Basil Fawlty. It seems some of us donrsquot merely tolerate curmudgeons behind the taps but actively enjoy being insulted. The title of Norman Balonrsquos memoir of his years as a Soho publican ndash Yoursquore Barred, You Bastards ndash sums it up. Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull.

People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty.

Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

He was executed in Aberdeen in , aged .If any good did come out of the case, it was that it probably expedited the abolition of the death penalty in Britain ndash it happened two years later. But whatrsquos striking is that, despite the abolition, public support for capital punishment was strong in this country and remains relatively high. The most recent Scottish Attitudes Survey shows about half the population supports the death penalty for some crimes.Itrsquos interesting that opinion is ided in this way at a time when it feels like almost every subject, including independence, is split into a binary yes or no, but the breakdown is dferent. We know therersquos a strong socially conservative streak in Scotland but it cuts across all the parties.

They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion. The death penalty was abolished in the s even though the vast majority of people supported it, so presumably the reverse could happen and a future government could ignore public opinion and reintroduce it.: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooItrsquos also worth remembering that, although support for the death penalty has dropped since the s, it has dropped at a very slow rate.

And anyone with serious breathing dficulties such as asthma is exempt anyway.Compared to England and the US - where there have been public protests against mandatory facemasks - hostility to the rule in Scotland has not been so pronounced, perhaps because we have less of a libertarian tradition.But among those who are opposed the same tropes emerge: dislike of being told what to dosuspicions that it might actually be harmful and scepticism of the evidence.What is interesting though, is that all this follows a well-worn template. Take seatbelts, for example.No one expects it to be routinely enforced by the police we do it because it could potentially save our own or others lives in a crash.But there was a time when seatbelts were considered controversial.The state of Wisconsin in the US was the first place to make front seatbelts a legal requirement in all cars built from  onwards.By then, there had already been fierce debate for  years that they might do more harm than good - for example, that they might cause internal injuries or make it more dficult to escape a vehicle which was ablaze or submerged in water. There were claims it would be safer to be \"thrown clear\".There were also arguments that wearing them should be a personal choice, not a legal mandate. Some car owners cut the seatbelts out of their cars in protest.: Slower exit from lockdown has had marginal effect on Covid infections and deathsAs recently as the s most Americans did not use them, and  per cent were opposed to them being enforced by law. As with muzzles for facemasks, seatbelts were depicted as tying up drivers.All this came against a backdrop of a landmark exposeacute in  - Unsafe at Any Speed - by consumer protection campaigner, Ralph Nader, which revealed car manufacturers reluctance to sacrice profits for safety features, despite mounting evidence around preventable death and injury.By the early s both the US and UK were finally making the wearing of seatbelts a legal requirement for drivers and front seat passengers. In, the law was extended in the UK to children in backseats, and to adults sitting in the rear from .Compliance among drivers and passengers is now well over % in Britain, with non-seatbelt wearers accounting for a disproportionate share of road crash fatalities - % in .Vaccination is another area of public health where the science around its benefits has become polluted by conspiracy theories and, of course, the persistent  claims of a link between MMR and autism.Some of the hostility is rooted in ignorance about the science, or scepticism about the motives of \"profiteering\" pharmaceutical companies. But it is also a simple dislike for \"being told what to do\".Immunisation is only effective in terms of creating herd immunityenough of the population comply. If enough people are vaccinated, a given infection has little opportunity to spread.: Why some scientists think handwashing and distancing might be insufficient to limit Covid spreadThat not only protects those who are immunised, but those with health conditions that make vaccination too dangerous. Nonetheless, making vaccination compulsory remains controversial - but sometimes its needed.Even in cases where the dangers are really not in dispute - such as passive smoking - it is hard to imagine that the elimination of indoor smoking would have been achieved without a legal ban.Like vaccination, unless enough people wear masks we wont see the benefit - and really, the purpose is to safeguard the most vulnerable whose own health perhaps might means they cannot wear one.There is nothing to lose and, potentially, quite a lot to gain."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-andre-previn-knew-score","story":"ldquoDonrsquot blunder into traps set at rehearsals.

Secondly ndash shamefully ndash people watched in case he plummeted to his death. Petit could have fallen at any moment ndash one slip would have seen him die. Nobody admitted it, but the expectation of disaster was as enthralling as the showmanship.:Neil Mackay: How would an independent Scotland deal with a problem like red China Today, the SNP is Petit. The party commands the stage, its performance is incredible, but what lies beneath its feet is so unsteady that therersquos the expectation that something awful is going to happen at any moment. For the audience, this mix of quizzical admiration and a sense of mounting calamity mean itrsquos impossible to look away.However, as an audience, the Scottish public today finds itself at the interval ndash kept on tenterhooks with the lead character, the SNP, poised precisely midway between absolute victory and complete defeat.In a Western world where trust in politics is supposedly dead, the SNP defies the new norm. After a shaky start to handling Covid ndash which many commentators, myself included, rightly gave Nicola Sturgeon a hard time for ndash the Scottish Government broke out of effective lockstep with the shambolic UK administration. As Boris Johnsonrsquos government staggered from one insulting, dangerous absurdity to another, Sturgeon projected calm and honesty ndash at the very least she was able to convincingly present herself as a person voters can trust.If looked at from the perspective of history, therersquos certainly an academic argument to be had, weighing the dferences between how Edinburgh and London faired over the unfolding course of the pandemic. Some will say that in terms of hard policy therersquos been little substantial dference in the actions of the two governments, and that when it comes to the numbers of fatalities therersquos really not a lot statistically between the UK and Scotland. However, that perspective is increasingly more dficult to accept with each passing day as the dferences between the two countries and their approach to Covid become more starkly defined.The harsh truth, however, is that policy nuance and the fine detail of statistics donrsquot really matter that much in political terms. What matters is: are you a convincing and trusted leader  When it comes to Johnson the answer is a screaming No with Sturgeon itrsquos a resounding Yes. Put bluntly, Johnson brings fear, and Sturgeon reassurance. That alone, as political capital, is worth a vault of gold.The party is booming in the polls. If the SNP was traded on the stock market, yoursquod bet your pension on it. Support for independence is now the majority position. The party seems assured of more success at the next Holyrood elections. Surely, this is hegemony Even the looming big political hurdles and intergovernmental fights seem designed to play to the SNP, rather than damage it. Every threat to Scottish powers by Johnsonrsquos government, every dismissing of a right to hold a referendum, every stupid Brexiteer policy, every idiotic Westminster gaff, just confirms for an increasing number of Scottish voters that anything is better than whatrsquos going on in London.:Neil Mackay: I wanted a revolution but got a culture war insteadIt might be dferentthere was effective opposition in Holyrood, but the unionist parties couldnrsquot hold their own toes to the firetheir feet were cold, let alone hold the SNP to account.And talk of accounts brings us neatly to the rest of the balance sheet ndash the loss side of the ledger. Today, profits looks rosy for the SNP, but losses are coming, and soon.The forthcoming inquiry into the Alex Salmond debacle will ndash as even the animals in Edinburgh Zoo know ndash pour acid over the party. The currency of trust could quickly devalue. Faith could become revulsion. Scandal could supersede success.This corrosive circus comes as the Yes movement starts to split, reflecting the deep, dangerous fissures within the SNP. For a long time, therersquos been a growing gulf between fundamentalists and gradualists. Now a new independence party has appeared threatening list votes for Yes.The SNP is ided not just over how to achieve independence ndash and when ndash but on a flotilla of existential issues. The splits are town-country, populist-centrist, woke-traditionalist, green-business, left-right, and even Leave-Remain.Inevitably, for an umbrella party which needs to pull as many into its big tent as possible, minor fights are taking on the shape of destructive ision. That big tent has been up so long that punters inside are starting to turn on each other.Then therersquos the perception of growing anti-English sentiment. To be fair, the perception is mostly driven by fringe extremists many of whom have nothing to do with the broader Yes movement. But as with trust in the SNP over Covid, itrsquos perception that matters not facts. When the First Minister has to tell voters she doesnrsquot have ldquoan anti-English bone in her body, itrsquos clear matters have gone off message. Such a perception will repel newly acquired soft Yes supporters.:Neil Mackay: Scotland can lead the world when it comes to revolutionising the economy in the face of pandemic hellip herersquos howI could close on a good old fashioned Scottish football metaphor warning the SNP about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. But I began with a tightrope allusion, so indulge me in ending on one also. If the SNP can pull off its high-wire act and make it across the great gulf of political space to the other side of the tightrope, it will transform this country. It will take Scotland out of the UK and onto the worldrsquos stage as an independent nation. The party would go down in history. If it falls from the tightrope, though, itrsquos all over.

Nationalists came closer, much closer, than unionists like to admit to victory in the  independence referendum. Far from accepting that defeat, support for independence has grown steadily from that  percent base to at least a dead heat.And, although I think it is risky for nationalists to invest too much stock in any polling conducted during an unprecedented crisis such as coronavirus, there is little doubt that, in this snapshot in time, nationalists are winning. Even No voters think that Nicola Sturgeon is doing a good job.Scottish nationalism is in the jaws of victory. So why, three times in the last week alone, have dferent parts of the movement taken steps which risk snatching defeat Victory for nationalists is not a complicated route to chart. It has three elements: win a majority based on a clear manesto commitment at a Scottish Parliamentary election obtain agreement from the UK Government to allow a referendum to be held persuade enough  No voters to vote Yes.So the question for nationalists, it seems to me, should be lsquodoes what I am doing make any of these elements more or less likely to happen rsquo. If we look at the output from the nationalist community over the last week, the answer has to be lsquoless likelyrsquo.Let us take it in turn. The creation of another pro-independence party ndash the Alliance for Independence or AFI ndash has been discussed for some time amongst those seen as agitators against Ms Sturgeon. They are, very broadly speaking, more fundamentalist about the route towards a second referendum and independence, set against the gradualist and more consensual approach of the SNP.On the face of it, AFI is a clever concept, exploiting the SNPrsquos strength in constituencies, peeling off the wasted SNP regional votes, and scooping up a large proportion of the  regional seats.The legitimacy or otherwise of lsquoplayingrsquo the Additional Member Systemvoting method is for another column, but as an exercise in maximising the number of seats for pro-independence parties the AFI proposal has solid logic.However, this is not solely about electoral success in May. The entire purpose of the exercise is, I presume, to lay the foundation for a second independence referendum. However, without the consent of Westminster, nationalist parties could win  seats and there will still not be a second referendum.There remains a debate in the Conservative party about the granting of indyref. The official line remains that there will not be one. Wersquove had one, we said no, we meant it, you said ldquoonce in a letime and so on and so on. Many influential figures at Westminster want this to remain the position others, though, understand the long term dficulties in repeating that age-old unionist mistake of ignoring what Scottish people have expressed a clear wish for, and hoping it will all be forgotten about.:Calls to Childline up by % during lockdownSo what are the conditions under which the UK Government will find it most dficult to deny another referendum  The answer to that is, in my view, a single party, SNP-only majority. This entails a single, clear manesto commitment, and a single party being elected on that .A perceived manipulation of the voting system will give the UK Government an lsquooutrsquo a muddying of waters as a result of blending dferent manesto commitments will give the UK Government an lsquooutrsquo the inclusion in the majority of a party linked to a more colourful and outlandish branch of nationalism will give the UK Government an lsquooutrsquo.There were a couple of other emanations from dferent parts of the nationalist community over the last week ndash the protests at the border by a small group of extremists, and the decision by the All Under One Bannergroup to proceed with a march as soon as Phase Four of the lockdown exit arrives, citing independence as a health lsquoemergencyrsquo.It is in these decisions that the third condition for independence ndash persuading switching amongst lsquosoftrsquo unionists who voted No in  ndash appears once again to have been given no thought.:Sturgeon says independence parked for as long as it takes to deal with CovidTake the protesters in their Hazmat suits. On the fringes of the nationalist movement, yes, but nonetheless attracting national publicity. The  percent who voted No last time have, by definition, at least some affinity with the Union, and with England. It may be social, cultural, economic it doesnrsquot matter what it is, it matters that it is there. Irsquod place a bet that precisely none of the two million people who voted No in  will be persuaded by the Hazmat brigade. Indeed, it has more chance of pushing Yes voters the other way.Similarly, the decision by AUOB, a more mainstream nationalist group, betrays a lack of understanding of who lsquosoftrsquo Unionists are, and what they think.The -or-so percent of voters who might go either waythere is another referendum are, self-evidently, moderate, pragmatic, and unbiased. Their choice is likely to be clinical rather than emotional. They probably voted No last time because they felt the nationalist arguments on the economy were too weak, too left-wing.Tell me, then, how a march of thousands of highly committed, flag-waving leftist nationalists is going to persuade the persuadables If I were a nationalist, looking to achieve independence forthwith, Irsquod be sticking by the SNP strategy.

The campaign was dubbed Whisky for Water.The team of experts who blended the whisky was led by writer, Whiskeria reviewer and star of lsquoThe Angelsrsquo Sharersquo, Charles MacLean, and includes Whyte  Mackay master blender Richard Paterson.Each bottle contains a small amount of whisky, which accompanied the boys during their -day row from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Antigua in the Caribbean in the Atlantic Campaigns Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.Just  bottles of MacLeanrsquos Pillage, a blended Malt, and  bottles of MacLeanrsquos Spillage, a blended Scotch, will be available. Additional  x cl miniatures of will also be released, sold via Edinburgh retailer Royal Mile Whiskies.Youngest Lachlan traveled to Madagascar two years ago where he saw for himself the real dference Feedback Madagascar was making to communities.He said: ldquoThe experience of making the whisky gave us a real insight into Dadrsquos world. Itrsquos no wonder people across the world are so enchanted by the flavours and stories behind Scotch whisky. The overwhelming generosity of the  West Coast distilleries which donated to our cause is a credit to the entire industry.ldquoEvery dram will save lives whisky is quite literally being turned into clean water.He added: ldquoWe know better than anyone how high Dadrsquos standards are, and hersquos very proud of this whisky. Ever since we sat down with Feedback Madagascar and dreamed up the lsquoWhisky for Waterrsquo campaign, wersquove been overwhelmed by the generosity of people from Scotland and beyond and wersquove loved every minute of working with our Dad to hopefully make even more of a dference.The whisky has been a year in the making and was collected during Broarrsquos first training run.Charles, who missed greeting the boys on the arrival from their world record-breaking row because they were more than five days quicker than anticipated, said: ldquoWhat a blender is trying to do is make something that is more than the sum of its parts. To my knowledge, this is the first time that all the distilleries on the west coast have collaborated and wersquove tried to balance the personalities of the dferent whiskies to create two unique, attractive and very rare blends.ldquoThis whole adventure - helping my boys get organised for the row, watching them break three world records and working with them to create these whiskies - has been a le-changing experience for them, and for me. Irsquom incredibly proud of them.The MacLean boys overcame seasickness, battery issues, storms, dehydration and exhaustion to reach Antigua in just  days. With their efforts, theyrsquove already raised more than pound, to be split between Scottish childrenrsquos charity, Childrenrsquos st, and Feedback Madagascar.These whiskies should raise almost poundk, which would allow Feedback Madagascar to build at least  new Broar holes.Jamie Spencer OBE, Managing Director of the Argyll-based charity, said: ldquoThe vast majority of the rural population of Madagascar doesnrsquot have access to clean water, and dirty water is a killer.

Weve been together for  years and, oh, the things we have seen, the places we have been.Shes due an MOT soon, I mention to my mum. \"That might be her last,\" she replies. I pat at Stellas air vent, as though it were an ear, so she doesnt hear. Ma Stewart softens and suggests I could keep Stella parked in her driveway, I wouldnt have to trade her in, nothing so brutal.But the thing about Stella is, she may be an old girl of  but she only has about , miles on the clock because, while I love her like a sister , I do practice what I preach. I do go on public transport as much as possible. I do ride my bike everywhere I can.We take a trip to Doncaster once a year to visit our friend Stephanie and we drive to Coatbridge from Glasgow every second week. Other than that, she largely sits in the carpark patiently waiting a next outing.I used to take the train to Doncaster every year, incidentally, until the fares went up wildly. For several years you could get aticket for about pound but then it became cheaper to fly to Europe than to rail southwards, so it was Stella to the rescue.Wed get lost every year, usually going awry somewhere around Scotch corner. One year I was delighted to find a practical application for my English Lit degree. Entirely lost, I stopped at a service station and clocked a red rose above the entrance. A rose  War of the Roses! Red  Bloody hell, Im in Lancaster. Wrong side of the country entirely and thank you Shakespeare.During the coronavirus, however, Stella has never been busier. When le started to slow down but we were still commuting in to the office, I started to drive to work every day due to, at first, a fear of coming in to close contact with people on the bus, and then due to reduced services.The bike was parked because I was having to carry a load of equipment back and forth, for boring reasons, and it was too heavy and didnt fit in my panniers. Friends who were still commuting did likewise, dropping public transport for the private car.While very much staying at home for the vast majority of the time, very rare trips that would normally be done on public transport have been done by car. Again, reduced services and reluctance to be close to strangers.As lockdown has eased, the car has become a focal point for allowing a slightto some normality. First it was drive thru food and drink outlets. Whereas you might previously have sat in, now driving through was the only option.Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils have now reintroduced parking charges, in an attempt to ease congestion and get back on track with carbon emission reduction aims while encouraging greener travel.This is the right thing to do, though it makes it tricky for workers while public transport is still reduced. It also reintroduces the conumdrum of how to encourage people to use our city centres and local high streets now that out-of-town shopping malls with their ample and free parking have reopened.Its not only commuting, shopping and dining that have become car-centric.Ato social and leisure activities is focusing on private vehicles too. There are drive-in comedy shows planned, drive-in movies and a drive-in gig - though this was cancelled due to concerns about localised lockdown restrictions.Its straightforward enough - being in a private vehicle is the most socially distanced place you can be while still enjoying pre-pandemic pursuits.Glasgows plans for a low emission zone in the city centre had made me start to think about what to do with my car. Is it more environmentally friendly to keep a relatively low emissions vehicle or to buy, say, an electric car but have that offset with the emissions generated producing it I hadnt started to look into that yet but had planned to, as well as trying to work outI could manage without the car and join a car club instead.Yet being in an emergency situation has turned all that on its head and made owning a vehicle, once again, the most attractive option, especially with the added boon of the tourism sector opening this week and the five mile travel limit lted.The oft repeated sticking point when pushing for increased levels of active travel has been the suboptimal public transport were faced with.Now, theres really no defence for public transport because its unarguably reduced. It wasnt good enough or joined up enough before, and now there is less of it.Our environmental concerns havent diminished during the Covid- pandemic, they are very much still there and very much in need of relentless, persistent addressing.Its now a bigger ask than ever before to urge people to embrace greener travel, an ask the transport minister made earlier this week. Reflecting on phase three of lockdown being the most dficult transition phase yet, Michael Matheson said, \"The obvious temptation for households with access to a car will be to take that option. However, we know many journeys are less than a few miles and could be covered via active travel, especially over the summer and autumn months.\"Using a car, though, isnt merely a temptation now. Its a common sense, understandable option for many. With a reduction in public transport and so many new car-based activities on offer, there are real additional issues of inequality for those households without a vehicle.The surge of people cycling in lockdown for leisure will, hopefully, be sustained and see those who are biking for exercise start commuting too.Id count myself as an active travel advocate but Im certainly going to have to wean myself back off driving as we move through the pandemic response. Car use is now predicted to rise to % of pre-covid levels. We dont want it any higher. Before lockdown there was so much will towards active travel - we need to be taking great strides towards that again.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

about the conduct of current Scottish Government Ministers and also former Ministers, including from previous administrations regardless of party.ldquoWhile I appreciate that the conduct of former Ministers would not be covered by the current Ministerial Code, I think it fair and reasonable that any complaints raised about their actions while they held office are considered against the standards expected of Ministers.ldquoI would be grateful for confirmation that this particular aspect is being included as part of the review you are leading.The Governmentrsquos chronology said Ms Sturgeon signed off the policy on  December.The Government also revealed that in late , after Ms Evans told staff about the review of harassment procedures, a female civil servant referred raised an issue of concern, which later developed into a formal complaint against Mr Salmond.The Government said Ms A was sent a draft of the complaints procedure ldquofor information but did not comment on offer any comments on the draft."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmKirkwall Leboat was called out to aid a -foot Danish yacht off Westray last night, in what was the first shout for the crew during the COVID- pandemic.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin .

Providing play parks do not get excessively busy and that the guidance is adhered to the level of risk should be low.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Officers have been working with PlayBoard NI to develop guidance for parents to enable facilities to reopen.Risk assessments have been carried out in accordance with Health  Safety Executive recommendations and research conducted by the UK Play Policy Forum into the impact of Covid- and children’s play.A range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of infection have been agreed and parents and children visiting play parks are asked to adhere to the following guidance:Closed Play ParksIf the play park you wish to use has not yet been officially reopened, please do no attempt to use or access the equipment, and we will get the play park opened as soon as possible.Secured equipmentIn some cases, damaged or broken pieces of play equipment may have been secured to prevent use. If an item has been secured in this manner, do not attempt to remove the temporary barriers or use the equipment.Social DistancingWhen visiting a play park make sure you follow current government guidance on social distancing, encourage and support your children to do the same and keep a safe distance from others not in your household social bubble.Busy Play ParksPlay parks may be busier than usual. If the park you visit is busy, consider coming back at a later time and let your child know in advance that this may be a possibility to avoid disappointment.Hand WashingWash your hands and your children’s hands before and after visiting the play park. Take hand sanitiser with you and ensure you and your child use it frequently whilst in the play park.Waste ManagementMake sure any disposable tissues, PPE equipment etc. are disposed of in the bins provided orone is not available take it home for disposal.Be SensibleIf you or anyone in your household are showing any Coronavirus symptoms, stay home and do not visit the play park.PlayBoard is inviting children aged between  and  to share their views about how Covid- has impacted on their play by taking part in a survey at https:www.surveymonkey r PBYourVoice "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Mr Hancock told the Commons there had been a problem with swabs, but there was no suggestion test results were affected.Mr Hancock told MPs: We#ve identied some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we#ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.And while we investigate further, we#re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits are paused in all settings until further notice.Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.There is no evidence of issues with any of our other test swabs, and there is no impact on access to testing.Shadow secretary of state for health John Ashworth asked Mr Hancock what was wrong with the Randox test kits - and how many had been used.Is there a health risk to anyone who has been tested with these kits  the senior Labour MP said.And how many people have these unsafe kits been used on and why weren#t the certications checked before these kits were used These kits tend to be used in many care homes.We want care home residents to be tested regularly, we want care home staff to be tested regularly - can he guarantee that those care homes will now get alternative kits rapidly Mr Hancock replied: The reason is that they had a CE stamp and upon investigation of the certication of that stamp, the certication was not forthcoming, and therefore physical checks were done and we found that the swabs weren#t up to the standards that we expect.This is limited to the Randox element of the testing system, not the broader testing system that we have.And I explained the clinical position, which is that there is no evidence of any harm having been done and that there is full access to testing because we have plenty of other test kits available.A statement on the Randox website said: As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batch supplier of swabs.This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business, which uses a dferent supplier of swabs.Test results from Randox kits are not affected.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was shocking so that#s when we decided to give it to a charity shop.I live in Belfast now and the dress was in my mother#s house in Strabane so my sister contacted the Kindness of Strangers charity and explained to them that we wanted to donate the dress to someone who deserved it.Danielle was keen that her act of kindness would bring joy to another bride.She continued: When I bought the dress it was a lot longer and bigger than I am, but I had an incredible dressmaker who made the dress fit me perfectly.She could have charged me thousands of pounds because of all the work she had to do but she didn#t and I appreciated that so much. She also came to my rescue two days before the wedding when it was clear that the veil I was going to wear didn#t match the dress at all. She conjured up a veil that was perfect. So many people did such kind things for Brian and I when we were getting married. I thought it was important tothat kindness and I am delighted it has turned out that way, thanks to the Kindness of Strangers charity shop in Strabane.The Kindness of Strangers shops, which raise money for Kinship Care Northern Ireland, posted photographs of Danielle#s dress explaining that it would only fit a bride who was around ft tall and a size eight who was getting married within the next  months. They even suggested that now was a good time for someone to hint at a proposal.Within two hours a heartfelt message was sent to the charity from an anonymous would-be bride who explained that although she and her fiance desperately wanted to get married, they had to keep putting the date off because of their finances - which had been made worse recently because her fiance had just been made redundant. Jacqueline Wilson from the charity, Danielle and her sister all agreed this was someone who would appreciate and love the dress.Ms Wilson said: Danielle#s sister contacted us and sent a photograph of the dress which we put on our Facebook page along with a message explaining what Danielle wanted but that the dress wouldn#t fit the average bride.There was a great reaction to it and so many people wrote about how beautul the dress was and suggested a few candidates who might like to hint at a proposal.The lady who has the dress sent a beautul message explaining her situation and how much she wanted to get married, but they just couldn#t afford it.She is the same height and build that would suit the dress, and maybe now she has the dress she will be able to go ahead and get married.Ms Wilson said running a series of Kindness of Strangers shops across Northern Ireland allows her to witness people#s generosity at first hand.She said: We have a number of these Kindness of Strangers shops now and hope to open ones in the future and we are constantly amazed at how caring people are and at the things they donate which has included a car.The Strabane shop has only been opened four weeks so we were delighted to be part of this story and delighted that it turned out so well.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The offences each carry a maximum penalty of up to  years imprisonment.The respondent had booked  international flights into or out of the UK between May ,  and May , . On  occasions, the outward andflights were within a matter of hours. The European Arrest Warrantstated that Mr Adams was stopped at Belfast International by Border Force officers on May ,  travelling with only hand luggage. The warrant said Mr Adams confirmed to Border Force officers that he had packed the bag himself.When asked whether anyone had given him anything to take out of the country, he replied: Yes, €,.The warrant stated that Mr Adams was interviewed under caution on May ,  and made no comment to questions asked in relation to the cash, his personal background, his employment status and financial position. Counsel for the State, Aoe Carroll BL, previously made an application to the court for Mr Adams# surrender and asked the court to let the chips fall where they may. She submitted that the respondent#s objections to surrender were speculative, vague, unsupported by evidence and were subject to innumerable iables so that the court could not refuse surrender on foot of same. Ms Carroll said she was satisfied surrender to the UK would not give rise to an unfair trial. She said nothing in the warrant was defective, nothing arose in relation to Brexit as the status quo remains in place, so surrender was not prohibited.Furthermore, Ms Carroll said thatan order for surrender was made against Mr Adams, she would be asking the court to postpone handing him over to the authorities in Northern Ireland until domestic proceedings had been determined.The court has heard that the respondent#s position was complicated by the fact that he has been ed for trial before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on separate money laundering charges, and his trial is due to take place in Dublin in June . Mr Adams had contested his surrender at the High Court, with his lawyers saying that he should not be extradited to Northern Ireland due to Brexit. Counsel for Mr Adams, Paul Comiskey O#Keeffe BL, had argued thathis client was convicted and sentenced in the Republic first, there would be an infringement of his rights to a fair trial in Northern Ireland in the future.He claimed this is because the UK would no longer be in the transitional period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the European Union. He further submitted that there was a real risk that the fundamental rights of the respondent would not be respected. Ordering his surrender to the UK yesterday, Mr Justice Paul Burns said he was satisfied that the extradition of Mr Adams was not prohibited by part three of the European Arrest Warrant Act . In light of the domestic offences brought against Mr Adams, the judge postponed his surrender to the UK until a later date.He remanded him in custody until July , .

They are pretty easy to suss out though, you get used to it, he told RSVP.He also admitted that being romantic hasn#t always been his strongest quality.I make an effort but it doesn#t come naturally to me, unfortunately.He had previously been in a two-and-a-half year relationship with Queen#s University student Jessica Gardner before splitting in .After Covid- paused the Six Nations earlier this year, Stockdale will now face fresh competition for a starting spot with the signing of Kiwi James Lowe.This will only be increased with the recent confirmation that the Lions tour in South Africa will still be able to go ahead next year.With Ulster resuming light training in recent weeks, Stockdale admitted he used the three month gap to re-watch every one of his matches with Ulster and Ireland.It#s probably a bit sad to admit that, but it#s something that I wanted to do just to see how I#d played, he told the BBC.It was really nice to look back at the games and realise the learning points that I#ve made over the course of my career so far.As well as reliving his career highlights, he also shared in May that lockdown has allowed him to indulge in his love of classic cars by attempting to restore a  Mustang he bought on eBay.At the height of the pandemic restrictions he also took part in a phone-a-friend campaign with the mental health charity Aware.I had my girlfriend around during lockdown, but I have friends who had to isolate by themselves for  weeks and it can be a struggle and a dficult time, especiallyyou are living with depression or any mental illness, he said at the time.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My kids love coconut and white chocolate and my wee girl has Rice Krispies every day for breakfast. And I just thought Cadbury#s don#t really have a bar that has coconut in it, she explained.It was also a case of second time lucky for the BT telecoms employee. She previously entered her recipe idea, but was not selected.The first time I had entered the same bar and never heard anything, until I got an email to say I hadn#t been chosen. But I thought I#m going to enter that again. So probably last August I picked the three same flavours, she recalled.Then last September or October I got an email from Cadbury#s to say that I was down to the final .

It#s very exciting. Already I#ve had loads of people tagging me on Facebook, saying that they can#t wait to try the bar, or they#ve already tried and loved it, she added.Having tried it, I recommend taking a couple of bites, that way you get the full impact of the coconut.The chocolate bars are exclusive to buy in Tesco until July , when they go on sale at other retailers. At that stage, added Gillian, three mystery celebrities will champion each of the flavours online. I did get a buzz seeing it on the display, she said. The kids are over the Moon, saying: #Are you famous now, mummy  And I say: #I wouldn#t go that far, but everyone knows my signature now#.The overall winner will be decided by a public vote at www.cadburyinventor, which accounts for % of the vote, with the remaining % split between other online polls and sales.

During his first visit to Belfast as Taoiseach, Mr Martin met with the First and Deputy First Ministers in Stormont Castle, as well as the leaders of the smaller parties.Despite renewed tension between the DUP and Sinn Fein over the Bobby Storey funeral, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill appeared together for a picture with Mr Martin on his arrival.Speaking afterwards, he said the wide-ranging discussions focused on suppressing any spikes in Covid- and minimising economic disruption caused by Brexit.He quickly side-stepped a question on how the First and Deputy First Ministers could reconcile, saying: I would never attempt to advise others in terms of relationship-building, but I think we had a very good, warm meeting today. Stressing the need for all-Ireland cooperation, Mr Martin said the Good Friday Agreement would remain the defining blueprint in a post-Brexit world.Given the enormous change that is taking place, there is a need to do some signicant work together in terms of... how we share the island in peace and in harmony, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMicheal Martin sitting down with the First and Deputy First MinistersPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMicheal Martin sitting down with the First and Deputy First MinistersThe Taoiseach said he was delighted that the first North-South Ministerial Council in three years will take place at the end of the month following the Stormont deadlock and disruption caused by Covid-.The body cooperates on areas such as the environment and waterways.Overall, I#m very encouraged by the meetings I#ve had... a genuine desire on all sides to work together in a pragmatic way to the mutual benefit of all the people of dferent traditions on this island, he said.After years of strongly criticising Sinn Fein as Fianna Fail leader, Mr Martin was askedhe would now soften his approach in his new role.My views on Sinn Fein are well-known, I#ve articulated them as a party leader... but as Taoiseach one has to be very conscious of the objective of the country, he said.He also played down any concerns over the dferent pace of lockdown on both sides of the border.Let#s be fair to both administrations, Covid- has been suppressed to a signicant degree, he said.That said, in the Republic over the last week or two we#ve had an increase in numbers, which the health officials are worried about.He added: All of us are very fearful of a second surge in the autumn, we#re very anxious to get the schools back and to deal with the non-Covid strand of medicine.Mrs Foster said she told the Taoiseach she looked forward to a positive dialogue during his tenure based on mutual respect for both jurisdictions and understanding each other#s dferences.Recovering from coronavirus had been the main focus of the meeting, she said, and working to rebuild both economies and protect public health. Mrs O#Neill called on Mr Martin to honour commitments made by the Irish Government in the New Decade, New Approach deal.I look forward to working on a north-south basis to ensure those crucial funding and practical commitments are fulfilled as soon as possible, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMicheal Martin removing his face mask as he prepares to meet party leaders at the Stormont Hotel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMicheal Martin removing his face mask as he prepares to meet party leaders at the Stormont HotelShe also backed recent calls to increase the use of mandatory face coverings in public. The Chief Medical Officer has made it very clear that while perhaps at one stage of this pandemic he was not convinced of the merits of face coverings, we are now in a space where he thinks that is the case.We will look at all of that evidence and then make a decision on that, but I think that as more and more people are moving around as we come to the end of the shielding period, there is probably a logical reason as to why face coverings should be a thing that we are all .Speaking to the media without Mrs Foster, she explained that they had moved naturally away from their joint appearances at the daily Stormont briefings.Mrs O#Neill echoed the Taoiseach#s call for an all-island approach to Covid-, and said the two governments# chief medical advisers were working closely together.Although Sinn Fein has now resumed the role of Opposition in the Dail, she promised to cooperate with the Taoiseach in his role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.In a statement, she also stressed the importance of the North-South Ministerial Council ing to work after a y absence.It is now six months since the restoration of the Executive and I made clear to Micheal that we must see delivery of all the Irish Government#s commitments in New Decade, New Approach.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"552859","story":"A County Derry community has raised thousands towards the restoration of the parish chapel, while travelling more than ,km in total. Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Creggan man, who plays for Stoke City, was in the news again this week when he criticised the reaction to sectarian abuse he has faced during his career in England. The Republic of Ireland player spoke out after a number of prominent footballers recently suffered racist abuse. While condemning the abuse,McClean criticised the football authorities, his Irish team-mates and the media over their response to racist and sectarian abuse he has suffered over the years. He is regularly abused for his decision not to wear a poppy. googletag.cmd.push Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination  McClean wrote this week on his Facebook page. He has received support fromSinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson who said more needs to be done to support the local footballer. “Its very sad that anyone would have to suffer such anti Irish racism in . I offer my support to James, Erin and their young family, she said. “Racism in any form must be challenged wherever it arises.There is no place for racism in soccer, sport or society. “I would appeal to those with influence within the sporting world to support James and his family. googletag.cmd.push “No person, in any walk of le, should have to suffer racial and sectarian abuse or intimidation. “It has been the case that James has been the subject of a witch-hunt and there has been avery vile campaign of hate against him across many s on social media. It’s totally wrong and shouldn’t be happening. There is a duty on us all to tackle racism and discrimination of any form in our communities and workplaces by challenging negative comments and behaviour.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The survey, which was launched last week, is seeking the views of the public and user groups to help Council plan and understand their requirements when they reopen. By participating in the survey the public will help Council identy the issues that matter to users of its leisure centre and sports facilities.

Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane. All updates relating to services and reopening will be communicated directly to members and on the ious social media s over the summer and on the website atwww.derrystrabane leisure.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One of the most familiar faces in youth football in Derry, McLaughlin has seen it all and done it all since taking the reins at the club in the early s, and in his time there has, with the help of others, elevated Celtics standing in the town to considerable heights. Yet with his partner Aisling, children Niamh , Cara , Caolan , Aaronand Rionato look out for, a degree in Community Youth Work and a job with Hillcrest Trust, Eamons plate is more than full. googletag.cmd.push The recent th anniversary celebrations of the club, plus the Covid- lockdown, gave the -year old plenty of time to reflect on both his past, and his future. So it was that McLaughlin took to Facebook earlier this week to announce his retirement, prompting hundreds of messages of support and congratulations. “It was a really dficult decision,” he admitted. “The timing however has been right for me and my family and the club. “I have been involved for  years and we have never been in a healthier position. We have more coaches than we have ever had, I think around  or  and in the last months, we have put a new committee in place, so we are in a really strong position. With that I felt the time was right for me.” googletag.cmd.push Its all a far cry from the day when he was thrust into the top position at the club, just  years of age and with little experience of coaching. “We were in the middle of a season and we had three or four matches in the league and we still had a cup run,” he recalled. “I was  years of age and I was helping Mousey Gallagher out and when he stepped away I was thrown into the deep end because there was no-one  there. “We kept it going and the likes of Oxy and Damien Doherty gave me a hand to fulfil the fixtures. We actually reached a cup final that season, but we were beaten - by Ashfield in the Brandywell. It was a brilliant season – I was hanging around with the boys as well as managing them – boys like Ryan Coyle, Eamon Morrow and Colm Fleming and a lot of those boys are now back coaching at the club, so its gone full circle for a lot of those boys as well as myself. There are so many sides to running a successful football club – but at its heart is the development of youngsters, on and off the pitch, and it is here especially where Top of the Hill has excelled according to McLaughlin. “The talent in Derry is unbelievable and thats one of the reasons I have always stuck by it,” he continued. “Its been great to see. Top of the Hill came in  years ago, but clubs like Oxford, Trojans and Don Boscos were already established. The talent is out there. For me, hand on heart, I got as much enjoyment from seeing a young fella who never got a kick as I do as someone lting a cup. Its about development. “Were slightly dferent to most clubs - because were living on the Interface, its more than about football. Im a youth worker as well so Ive always tried to tie the two in together. At this time of year we would have had trips and interventions to keep young people off the streets and away from rioting. “I got a text the other day from a young fella in Claudy saying that, more than football, he missed the trips we would do through The Whistle and Hillcrest. Its brilliant to hear that its not just about football because there are only so many young fellas who will make it as footballers. Its the community spirit and its the family atmosphere and I hope that continues on. Thats a big thing for me.” Celtic have had their share of big names come through their ranks in McLaughlins time – Rory Holden , Josh Daniels, Michael McCrudden and Darren McCauley some of those to build careers in the game.  Current Derry City midfielder Jack Malone also has his roots in Top of the Hill and McLaughlin admits that seeing a player reach his potential is the best kind of reward. It was in fact, McCruddens transfer to Newcastle United  years ago, coinciding with the tragic death of friend and fellow coach Keith Roddy, which lit a fire in McLaughlin. “Michael, at  or , was the first ever Top of the Hill Celtic player to go across the water,” he explained. “At the same time, in , Mickeys mentor, Keith Oxy Roddyhad died, and at that point I made the conscious decision that Im grabbing this by the horns and take the club where it needs to be, with the help of the likes of Paddy Logue, Higgs, Gerard Dunlop and boys like that.  “There were a very small amount of coaches but we had teams at every age group. You were out five or six nights a week. In the last two or three years, that has changed because now we have two or three coaches at every age group. I dont know for the le of me how Jon Clford and boys like that did it on their own. They deserve every credit that they get. “When I was starting out, boys like Jon Clford and Noel Crampsey, thats the boys you spoke to and asked advice of. Even though they were your competitors on the pitch, they wrere all in it for the same reasons, and they guided me, but no-one more so than Mickey Hutton in the DD. Any problems that I had ever with football, he was at the end of the phone, and the support that the DD have given us as a club hasnt gone unnoticed over here.”  is the first year that the Foyle Cup has not run in the city since its inception in , and while it is a loss for every club throughout the city, McLaughlin cannot wait for its– with the tournament holding a special place in the Top of the Hill calendar. “We try to get at least one team in every age grouppossible,” he said. “Some teams arent great, some are better than others, but they still get the opportunity to play in the Foyle Cup, and that, for me, is amazing. If youre winning - or getting beat -, your family are there supporting you during the Foiyle Cup, savouring the atmosphere and meeting new people. The buzz about the whole city throughout the week is phenomenal.” His time with Top of the Hill, for now, has reached an end, but the green and white will remain in his blood, and when football s, he will likely be the first on the sidelines cheering on his team. “Top of the Hill has been my le for  years, without a shadow of a doubt,” he stated.  “Its meant absolutely everything and will continue to mean everything to me. “It has given me some amazing memories and it will always be one of the proudest things that Ive done in my le. “Without the help and support of so many people – even the likes of my mother and sister, it all runs in their veins. Seeing the club celebrate its th anniversary last year probably sparked off my thinking that maybe it was time to move this on. The Covid thing gave me time to reflect and think – we are in a healthy spot at the minute and we need to have every faith in the boys who are going to take up the baton and run with it. “The amount of coaches we have now is credit to where people see us. You mightnt be as big a club as Tristar or Oxford, but were well up there. The respect that Top of the Hill Celtic has throughout the city is phenomenal.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery. It is essential that they have the publicrsquos backing and support at this critical time, he said.ldquoIt is more important than ever that we support our local shops, cafes, bars and restaurants who collectively provide signicant employment, supporting many families.Cllr Andrews said local businesses and ious retail outlets ldquohave all gone the extra mile, working to implement guidelines and regulations designed to keep staff and customers safe at all times.He added: ldquoCrossgar is one particular part of the district where businesses have worked hard to ensure that people are safe, whether shopping or out for something to eat.ldquoThe village is home to a number of businesses, many of them family-owned, and it is important that we support them at this time, alongside other businesses across the district.

I would like them to get in touch.William said he has heard many reports about the disaster, including one relating to men from Portaferry who allegedly took a piano off the ship.The Georgetown Victory was a lsquoVictory Shiprsquo and was built in  at the Fortfield Shipyard at Bethlehem, Maryland, in the United States. She weighed in at , tons and was powered by two steam turbine enginesSays William: ldquoThe vessel was registered at Baltimore and when it left Fremantle for Glasgow with , Royal Navy men and marines due for demob. The crew mistook Strangford Lough for the River Clyde and the ship ran aground  yards off Killard Point, with her back breaking just forward of the bridge within a few hours of stranding.The Georgetown Victory had been converted from a cargo ship to a troopship able to transport up to , troops, with her cargo holds converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels. But he has no intention of doing so.His next project will be making a model of the SS Bereby, a British merchant steamer built in  and owned by the Elder-Dempster Line.In , the vessel, which was carrying military stores and general cargo, was wrecked at Ringvad Point, near Gunnrsquos Island, while en route from Liverpool for Takoradi.Anyone who can assist William with information about the Georgetown Victory is asked to contact him on    or pop into his shop in Quay Street..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call to be vigilant of seals  ","story":"VISITORS to Minerstown beach are being urged to tread carefully to protect seals and the arearsquos rich ecology.The appeal has been issued by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with officials particularly keen for boats and jet skis to stay away from key areas.Minerstown beach mdash popular with locals and visitors alike ndash is located within the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and, along with neighbouring Tyrella, is part of the Murlough Special Area of Conservation and area of special scientic interest.Noted for its honeycomb worm reefs and harbour seals, Minerstown was particularly busy over recent months with many people furloughed from work as part of sweeping coronavirus lockdown measures visiting the beach where harbour seals which are protected by law.Then animals use the rocky outcrops just offshore as so-called haul-out and pupping sites with the peak pupping season running from the end of June to mid-July.Pups wean from their mothers approximately four weeks after birth and, for this reason, council officials are asking all watercraft owners to stay away from the haul-out areas until the end of October.Council staff say that with seals very sensitive to disturbance, it is important for people to leave them alone.They say the area between the beachrsquos high and low tide marks is an important site for sand flats with boulders containing the honeycomb worm reef, a Northern Ireland priority marine feature.The worm lives in tubes constructed from small pieces of sand and shell fragment cemented together forming reefs between pebbles and boulders in the middle shore.Council officials have explained that these delicate reefs are under threat from beachgoers walking in the area and from vehicles driving on the beach.ldquoUnderstanding the impact that our actions can have and following simple advice will protect the health of the wildle at Minerstown beach and protect it for future generations, said officials.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said people were spoilt for choice when it came to local beaches and the waterways, with Minerstown one area which has seen an increase in use during the lockdown period.ldquoUnfortunately, an increase in the use of the beach and its surrounding waters can cause some problems for the local wildle, he said.ldquoThe council is asking beach goers to help it protect these beauty spots and the associated plants and animals by being mindful of how their actions can impact on the environment.Describing Minerstown as a ldquovery special place, she said it was important for local wildle.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoWhile we want our residents and visitors to enjoy the wonderful coast that our district has to offer, we also want to protect the habitats and species that make this place so special.ldquoPlease help us to protect this area by not taking vehicles onto the beach, stay away from the seal haul-out sites, always keep dogs under control and not allow them to chase birds.

I hope it is not obeying the tune of centralising services in Belfast. The local population deserves better.The former South Down MP said that as Northern Ireland was being reopened for business following a reduction in the number of Covid cases, ldquonormal services at the Downe hospital should resume.Lady Ritchie said anything which falls short of what was previously in the hospital would ldquorepresent a lack of faith and trust.She added: ldquoIt is important to remember that the real ing of the Downe Hospital with its suite of services and consultant physicians is directly linked to the AE provision.ldquoI have told both the health trustrsquos chief executive and health minister Robin Swann that anything that falls short of that requirement will be unacceptable and present our community with an intolerable position.Last week, health officials insisted that emergency services removed from the Downe as part of sweeping changes to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be reinstated. In addition, officials branded claims that the service will notand be replaced with a daily minor injuries service as ldquoinaccurate and misleading.The health trust says that it hopes to be in a position to confirm a date for theof AE services to the Downpatrick hospital by the end of July and that it remains totally committed to the Downe and its staff..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11591843.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a

an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

Its launch date has been set for between July  and August .The UAE spacecraft, named Amal, or ldquoHope in Arabic, is an orbiter built in partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder and is now scheduled to launch from Japan on Monday. It will be the Arab worldrsquos first interplanetary mission.Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago, when it had water sources that may have supported tiny le forms before turning into the frozen world it is today.So far, the US has been the only country to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times.Two Nasa landers are operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit ndash three US, two European and one from India.Chinarsquos last attempt at a Mars mission in collaboration with Russia ended in failure in .

In order for staff and guests to enjoy a safe cinema trip, Omniplex have implemented a range of new measures including: * Pre-Booking of tickets – to control the number of patrons in foyers and auditoriums, tickets need to be booked online. * In-Cinema Seat Separation – the system will dynamically lock empty seats around your booking so you can sit next to your friends but will be distanced from others * Limited capacity – they are limiting the number of guests at any time in the foyer and screen capacities will reduce by over % * Enhanced cleaning regimes – including screens and all customer touchpoints. Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of their cinemas * Reduced showtimes – only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. These policies will be adapted in line with official guidance. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex Cinemas said: We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show”.
