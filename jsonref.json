Sonia is the second of his advisers to be sacked by No10 in the past few weeks. They briefed the media he was going to cut fuel duty in the Budget without even discussing the idea with him.‘And then they scrapped his first big speech the night before he was due to give it. That’s not the basis for a good relationship.’An ally of Mr Javid played down suggestions of a rift, saying: ‘Would it have been courteous for Cummings to have consulted Saj before sacking Sonia? Yes, of course it would. It was rude, but that is his style.’The firing of Miss Khan, a popular figure in government circles, sparked dismay among some fellow advisers yesterday, although Mr Cummings also had support for the move.Downing Street insiders fear that they could face legal action over the manner of Miss Khan’s sacking. Sources told the Mail on Thursday night she had been dismissed for leaking Brexit secrets.         No10 insisted Mr Johnson and his Chancellor ‘work very well’, adding: ‘It has already been an incredibly productive relationship.’ But there isn’t a fag paper between Saj and the PM. He completely agrees with the need to run a disciplined operation in the current climate’It is understood she was called in by Mr Cummings because he suspected her of consorting with allies of Mr Hammond, a leading figure in the plot to halt No Deal.A source said Miss Khan was presented with a list of names and denied she had spoken with any of them recently. Mr Cummings demanded she hand over her work and personal phones and went through them. He is said to have discovered she had spoken that day with a close aide to Mr Hammond and had deleted a string of WhatsApp messages to the same person.She was fired, ordered to surrender her Whitehall security pass and ‘frogmarched’ from No10 by a police officer. Mr Cummings was the only official present and no notes were taken. Sources acknowledge they have no evidence about the nature of Miss Khan’s discussions with Mr Hammond’s aide. A Cummings ally defended the decision, saying: ‘In the end, she lied to one of the most senior advisers in Number 10 – that would be a sacking offence in any government.‘Dom has two rules. He doesn’t care who you are or what your background is. He just cares that you are good at your job and he can trust you.’But Dave Penman of the FDA union for senior civil servants said the case ‘raises serious concerns about the treatment of this group of staff who are, ultimately, the responsibility of the appointing minister.’         Last night Mr Cummings stuck to his guns when he addressed the weekly No10 meeting for government advisers. It was reported that he said: ‘If you don’t like how I run things, there’s the door – f*** off.’No10 insisted Mr Johnson and his Chancellor ‘work very well’, adding: ‘It has already been an incredibly productive relationship.’ But there isn’t a fag paper between Saj and the PM. He completely agrees with the need to run a disciplined operation in the current climate.’Government sources yesterday confirmed another of Mr Javid’s aides, Olivia Robey, was ousted by No10 earlier this month. Sources declined to say why, but it is not thought to be leak-related.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Cummings now appeared to be running the Treasury from Number 10. He added: ‘It would be better if Dominic Cummings came along next week to present the spending review as he’s obviously in charge of the Treasury as well as No10. If you can’t speak without his permission and can’t even decide your own staffing you’re hardly the chancellor.’ "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95043df74620c0360f2b59083ab2c8162500274c/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4059efae7df51114f07cd2973c1c0a","title":"graffiti covered banksy truck to be auctioned","story":"Bonhams to sell massive artwork at Goodwood Revival sale next monthAmong the gleaming Bugattis, Aston Martins and Porsches at one of the UK’s premier car auctions next month will be a 17-tonne truck with a price tag to match them all. Bonhams has announced it is selling what can arguably be called Banksy’s largest artwork at its Goodwood Revival sale on 14 September.The truck was covered with graffiti by Banksy in 2000, when he was still very much under the art world’s radar. While a used Volvo FL6 box truck might cost a buyer somewhere in the low thousands of pounds, this one is estimated at between £1m-£1.5m.Ralph Taylor, Bonhams’ head of postwar and contemporary art, said he was thrilled to have the work in the sale. “Banksy is arguably the most important artist to have emerged since the millennium and this, his largest commercial work, represents a new high watermark of quality for works of his to appear at auction,” he said. “The composition bears all the hallmarks of this peerless agent provocateur.”The artist was at an open-air party in Spain to celebrate the millennium when he was presented with the truck by Mojo, the co-founder of Turbozone International Circus.He started on the truck during the party and continued to work on it for a fortnight. It was then used, for years, as the company’s transport around Europe and South America.The truck is called Turbo Zone Truck (Laugh Now But One Day We’ll Be In Charge). It is funny and anarchic and features flying monkeys, soldiers running away from a cannon, and a man about to smash a TV screen with a hammer.Bonhams said the overriding message of the piece was anarchy – “It’s us against them and we’re going to win.”Taylor said there was no getting away from what the work was. “It is an enormous great lorry,” he said. “Contemporary art can be anything, from a small painting to an installation that takes up an entire room. This is a 17-tonne lorry and it is completely painted. It’s an immersive experience … It is incredibly impressive when you see it.”Taylor said the work dated from a pivotal moment in Banksy’s career, a time when he was beginning to work in the studio, as well as on the street, producing work that he would show in self-staged exhibitions.The lorry carries motifs that can be seen over and again in Banksy’s work, particularly monkeys. One image is a riff on Soviet-era posters of industrial work, in which Banksy shows a factory worker with a Mohican haircut smashing a television.“There are references to art history and to social history,” said Taylor. “Banksy is always at his best when there is that kind of vicious black humour. When it’s funny, that’s when it’s good, and that’s why he is so successful, that is why he keeps on being voted the nation’s favourite artist. It feels like he’s been coming top of those polls for a decade.”The lorry was created at a time when street artists were often considered a menace, the reason why Banksy always pictures himself as a rat and calls his company Pest Control.“For someone to give him free rein to paint an entire lorry that would then travel around would have been such a huge gift and opportunity, to have such a big canvas with no risk of getting arrested.”The market for Banksy is a strong and global one, said Taylor. The auction record for one of his works is $1.9m – a Damien Hirst spot painting on to which Banksy has stencilled a maid doing the cleaning.Last year the art world was left stunned when a Banksy work, Girl With Balloon, began to shred itself after the hammer went down at Sotheby’s in London for £1.04m. It was given a new title by Banksy, Love Is In The Bin, and is the only artwork ever created live during an auction.Bonhams said it expected strong interest from institutions as well as collectors passionate about collecting unusual vehicles.The truck will be sold by the auction house on the Goodwood estate in West Sussex, the ancestral home of the Duke of Richmond, founder of the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival.One of the more traditional highlights of the 14 September sale is an ultra-rare 935 Bugatti Type 57 Atalante Faux Cabriolet, which has an estimate price of £1m-1.5m.Three years ago Bonhams sold a Banksy Swat van which he created for his breakout Barely Legal show in Los Angeles. It fetched £218,500."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914973c831d447709d865b87e44c327ac3a4a717/0_241_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dd89976f2f0190ee4bf6653fa42fcf2","title":"nell zink my hope for the planet is that were invaded by kindly aliens","story":"Five years and five novels after she exploded on to the literary scene, so assured that some believed she was a hoax, Zink is taking on hipsters and the climate crisisAfter Nell Zink’s mother died a few years ago, she asked her friend Tom to treat her for post-traumatic stress. Zink was having trouble sleeping, and her friend, a semi-famous German singer-songwriter, had retrained as a shaman. “I laid down and closed my eyes, Tom did this shamanistic ritual, and when I came out of this trance an hour later, he looked at me and said: ‘I am afraid I have to tell you, Nell, you have no subconscious mind.’”Zink laughs hysterically while telling this very Zink-esque story. “He’d gone into my mind, and there is usually an empty room with doors. But in my case that room was completely full with an over-the-top, psychedelic party that was really loud and populated by these nightmarish creatures. It was complete overload and there was no escape.”A wild party in your mind, crammed with colourful characters and no taboos: as an introduction, that’s also a good description of Nell Zink’s fiction. Her debut novel, The Wallcreeper, moved from birdwatching to anal sex within the opening seven pages. Her follow-ups, Mislaid, Nicotine and Private Novelist, filled the room with all varieties of modern misfits: feminist squatters, smokers’ rights activists, white lesbian mothers who self-identify as black, Israeli spies, mythical seal-women. In her latest, Doxology, the party gets even louder: the novel’s main protagonists are a post-punk three-piece propelled by an unlikely Top 10 hit into a world of music videos, free drugs and signature dance moves.If Tom the shaman is right and all these people were merely hanging around on the surface of her waking mind, waiting to be harvested into short sharp novels, it would explain the speed of Zink’s rise to fame: Doxology is the fifth book in five years from the 55-year-old writer who until 2014 was living in complete obscurity in a small town outside Berlin.When US magazines first took notice of her blackly comic prose, the rumour in the German capital’s literary circles was that “Nell Zink” had to be a JT Leroy-style hoax, or a pseudonym for an already established author such as Jonathan Franzen, the US novelist who championed her. Her writing was too stylistically assured for someone with no track record of plugging away on the fringes of the publishing industry, her name too neatly memorable. And who on earth would choose to live in Bad Belzig, a medieval spa town in Brandenburg, preened into pensioner-friendly blandness with post-Wall subsidies?In fact, Zink lives in the middle of Bad Belzig’s high street, in a top-floor flat that looks as if it is being let for the short term even though she has occupied it for six years, with mismatched pieces of furniture and a mattress in every corner of the room. Having completed a PhD in Tübingen, in Germany’s south, she was looking for a place halfway between Dessau, where she has friends, and Berlin, which has airports, and her index finger landed here. “It’s the spaceship principle”, she says, pulling a wicker chair up to a marble table in her living room. “I like having the infrastructure. I really like that when I want to go to the post office I have to walk 75 yards. There’s a stationery shop, a drugstore, supermarkets, everything is really close.” She’s aware of the rumours about her fictional identity but unfazed by them: “People who claim to live in Berlin but don’t spend any time there, they are the real hoax”.The other reason people assume Zink might not be real has to do with her prose style. Her novels are usually set among exclusive social scenes with their own codes and rituals – birdwatchers, hippy communes, New York’s 90s indie rock scene – but they are always written from the inside. There are no rock cliches, no “stabbing angular guitars” in Doxology, but instead “high fretting”, “Phil Lesh meets the Congos bass”. Who has the kind of life experience that makes them familiar with so many different walks of life and their mannerisms?In Doxology, the knowingness is both a pose appropriate to its setting, and a sign of lived experience. In the mid-90s, Zink played the guitar in F.E.R.R.E.T., a New York noisecore band she describes as “terrible but glorious”, and that doesn’t sound too dissimilar to Marmalade Sky, the band at the heart of her new novel.“It has come to my attention that the times and places of my fiction and my biography can overlap. I lived in Virginia until about 89, and that’s when Mislaid ends. This novel picks up in 89 in DC and New York, which is where I went after that. And yet there is nothing autobiographical about it, I swear. I use material because I think it makes for good fiction when you know what you are doing.”In a novel in which characters often talk “pitched low and on the inside, knowing and hopeless, every clause meaning and mourning its opposite”, one of the most memorable and quotable passages mounts an earnest defence of what Zink calls the “80s hipster”: “The eighties hipster bore no resemblance to the bearded and effeminate cottage industrialist who came to prominence as the ‘hipster’ in the new century,” it says. “The eighties hipster was the short-lived cap of spume on the dirty wave of working-class higher education.”Born in Corona, California, in 1964, Zink studied and worked in Virginia and Washington DC before immersing herself in New York’s music scene. As well as living in Germany, she also spent several years living in Israel. Is Zink still an 80s hipster at heart? She emphatically rejects this, only to slowly backtrack by narrowing down her definition even further: hipsterdom in the 80s was not just about intellectual one-upmanship, but an idealistic search for a kind of purity.“When I was way younger and more sensitive, before I watched Tarantino and still had a soul, I listened to bands like Swans, Foetus or Nurse With Wound. Someone hitting a garbage can lid over and over, amplified beyond belief with a lot of chorus on it. That’s what hipsters listened to back in the 90s. Watching horror movies like From Beyond, or documentary footage of the Katyn forest massacre.”While she played in F.E.R.R.E.T, Zink also published a fanzine called Animal Review, in which indie musicians wrote about their favourite animals (Steve Albini of the band Shellac wrote about lemurs). The tagline was “hard music and soft animals”: jaded on the outside, sweet on the inside, that was the mode of her social circle.Zink wrote each of her first two novels in the space of only three weeks. By her own admission, Doxology took much longer, undergoing several revisions, and it is more than just a period piece about 90s New York. “I wanted to put together a mosaic that cast a unified shadow,” she says.A “doxology” is a short hymn of praise to God in Christian worship, but there are also instances of doxing (publicising others’ private data online) and women referred to as doxies (sex workers). In ancient Greek, doxa can mean “glory” but also its apparent opposite, “illusion”, and one of the central paradoxes Zink’s novel wrestles with is whether it is possible to be real by faking it.While the first half of Doxology is essentially a defence of the hipster’s devotion to naivety and purity, exemplified at its most saintly by Marmalade Sky’s singer Joe Harris, the second half investigates the limitations of the same mindset. We follow Flora, the daughter of guitarist Pam and drummerkeyboarder Daniel, a passionate environmental scientist who campaigns for Jill Stein, the Green party candidate who helped to split the left-liberal vote in the 2016 US elections. In the age of Trump, the search for moral purity can become a problem in its own right: good intentions aren’t enough. Or, as Flora’s boyfriend, an elderly Democratic strategist, says: “Positive is how people feel when you unite them in hate.”“Flora would like to change the world, but how do you change the world?” Zink asks. “There are 7 billion people, can anybody change the world? And then sometimes examples come along of horrible people who manage to change the world in distressing ways. Maybe effecting a negative change is possible for one person. To build something requires an entire ecosystem working together in concert. To break something, you just need one bullet.” Doxology is, in the best possible sense, a novel at odds with itself. If it wasn’t for the fact that Zink apparently doesn’t have a subconscious mind, you could say it reads like the sound of an author whose intellect is wrestling with her heart.In her second novel, Mislaid, the protagonist used a stolen birth certificate to create an African American identity for herself and her daughter – a plot line conceived before the world had heard the name Rachel Dolezal, an official for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who turned out to have no African ancestry whatsoever. Doxology seems to achieve a similar feat of clairvoyance. The novel seems to anticipate Greta Thunberg’s rise to prominence. When I suggest this, Zink’s response is surprisingly cautious. “Her success in getting young people to skip school is certainly … remarkable,” she says with composure, before remarking that even arch-conservative politicians in Bavaria have started to talk about cheaper public transport and banning plastic bags. I am about to express my agreement when she interrupts: “It’s such a crock of bullshit! I don’t know what flaming swords Greta Thunberg needs to have to get reactions that are not just crocks of shit.”But isn’t it a real achievement that politicians can no longer avoid talking about the climate crisis? Zink is having none of it. “Your memory isn’t very long. Merkel used to talk about the environment all the time. And nothing happened. She worked actively against her own promises. It was lies. They lie. They are going to lie to Greta Thunberg.” She gets up to fetch a tissue and dab her eyes, then returns to the table.What does she mean by pessimistic? To say we are all doomed? “Oh, I don’t think we are doomed. The human race is going to be fine. Guess what: we are highly intelligent and adaptable. The human race is not in trouble. But as always poor people will be in trouble and the natural world will be fucked to the wall.” Isn’t that optimistic, too, to say we will survive as a species? “Most people don’t read books because they play video games that require servers. Every game has a server out there that consumes as much electricity as a city of 100,000 people. That’s the reality. No amount of generation of renewable energy is ever going to keep up with our appetite for data processing.”Luckily, the party in Zink’s mind isn’t just made up of cynical doomsters wearing black, but also young idealists full of dreams. And as in her novels, they talk over each other all the time. “My hope for the planet is that we would be invaded by the kindly aliens in Arthur C Clarke’s novel Childhood’s End,” she adds. “They would just put a stop to it all: ‘You can’t run your planet this way.

It cited a study showing that up to a third of fish caught in the North Sea contained microplastic particles – including glitter – raising fears about the impact on sea life and humans.M\u0026ampS’s action on glitter and plastic comes after Waitrose pledged to ensure own-label cards, wraps, crackers, flowers and plants are either glitter-free or use an environmentally friendly alternative by 2020. Tesco has switched to a plastic-free version for its Christmas range of trees, plants and flowers this year while discount chain Aldi is scrapping plastic glitter from this year’s Halloween range.Craft retailer Hobbycraft has also launched biodegradable glitter alternatives and has pledged that its range will be free of plastic glitter by 2021.The BBC show Strictly Come Dancing banned the use of traditional glitter on the programme last year, while many nursery schools and music festivals in the UK have also axed it.Paul Willgoss, director of food technology at M\u0026ampS, said: “We know reducing single-use plastics is as important to our customers as it is to our business.”M\u0026ampS said all Christmas stationary designs which previously featured glitter were now recyclable and innovative paper patterns or “minimal” use of foil were providing festive sparkle. The retailer’s Christmas gifting range of flowers and plants and single-use packaging for food products, will also be glitter free this year. The majority of its boxed cards have also switched from plastic to card packaging, saving almost 50 tonnes of plastic.M\u0026ampS said it has already removed 1,000 tonnes of plastic packaging from across its business and aims to ensure all its packaging is widely recyclable by 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9df2f5edca7168fcfae4b3f010af510282e163b/0_0_4016_2411/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bde630eaab36ebdb628daeaf56b9ec7","title":"like an old vampire woman lingering in her eternity lisbon a cartoon","story":"Lisbon has constantly reinvented itself over the centuries – though its popularity with tourists today sometimes threatens to overwhelm the cityLisbon is irresistible to photograph, film and, of course, draw.For my sketches I normally use a black disposable brush pen and a few grey markers to create a sort of manual aquatint (like a black and white photo). For me, it is a kind of fundamentalism: a drawing should be colourless.But Lisboa has never a city in aquatint.There is something dazzling in her light that requires brighter media. The wide estuary in the south, multiple buildings dressed in azulejos (bright ceramic tiles), and dazzling white stone pavements that mirror an intense extra light, illuminating even the darker shadows.But over the past 10 years, this bright, beautiful city has attracted worldwide interest – and tourism has increased exponentially. In 2018, 29 million people passed through Lisbon airport alone Lisboa city has a population of just 500,000.Nowadays, the tourism trend is to pretend to live in a place as locals. Visitors rent apartments neatly furnished, conveniently placed in upper floors showing oblique stunning views of rooftops and a triangle of blue river, close to a small supermarket and a “neighbourhood” restaurant – everything one needs to feel at home.I welcome these tourists pushing their strollers, spoon stirring their €0.65 bica (espresso coffee) or supermarket shopping as though they are staying for a month. I wish they would stay: we need inhabitants more than we need transient tenants.Today, despite being surrounded by quite a number of Airbnb apartments, Jardim das Amoreiras is still a quiet, almost unknown Eden on the fringes of the old 19th century town. The tourists who stay here, like the silk, combs, and ceramics once produced in the buildings around the square, descend every morning to the city centre, waiting to be shipped back to their original places.On one of the square’s sides, a giant aqueduct built in the 1740s ends in the first great reservoir of the water distribution system. Mãe de Água (Mother of Water) provided reliable water for all the factories’ needs.Most of the apartment buildings in the area were built in the 1930s as part of the modern urban transformation when the industrial centres had already moved to the eastern part of the city and the south river bank. Twenty years ago it was possible for a middle class family to buy an apartment here. Since then, the prices have more than quadrupled in the area (the most rapid price increase has happened in the past five years). Short term rental companies buy apartments or entice owners to let theirs out. More and more homes are passing out of the normal long term renting market.Early each morning I pass by Mãe de Água. Its purpose was to contain water but, for some glorious reason, they decided to give it architectural significance. From the outside, it looks very plain (itself a miracle during those rococo years) but inside it is breathtaking. I teach at a design school, which since 1996 has been based in a building built on the site of the old Santos dock. So every day, I roll down São Bento street just like a crate of combs did in 1780.Between Amoreiras and Santos, near Amália Rodrigues Museum, is the 100-year-old swimming club, Clube Nacional de Natação, where I swim daily. The club used to have an open air swimming pool, which was the only place to swim in the old city centre from 1930s to the 2000s, but it is now covered by padel courts (a strange imprisoned tennis that apparently only Spaniards and Portuguese play). The prime minister’s official residence is nearby, and legend has it that Salazar, Portugal’s dictator between 1936 and 1968, was often annoyed by the joyful screams of children playing in the water.The school where I teach was originally in a palace in Chiado, very close to Largo de Camões. The palace has had several tenants, the most famous of whom was General Junot, who conquered Portugal on behalf of Napoleon in the first French invasion. From the main balcony in the palace he could see the Cais do Sodré docks, from where the royal family fled to Brazil escorted by British warships. Junot stayed only until August 1808 when his army was defeated. Later, bored in Paris, Madame Junot complained in her writings that she missed Lisbon’s light and delicious fruit.We used to hold life drawing classes in a room called “Sala Romana” where the battles between the Romans and the Sabines are frescoed on the walls. The frescoes were finished in 1822, and the artist depicted himself at the age of 25. In 1878 he restored his own paintings and, despite having the option to update his image, chose to keep it as it was 56 years earlier.The school left the building in 2013. These days, the rooms where once Madame Junot rejoiced in the taste of a succulent peach and so many generations of students struggled with art history and human anatomy are a gourmet restaurant.The school’s new building is in the buzzing Santos area – a former industrial area that until the school moved in was run down and seedy. In 1979, the building where the school now functions was built, designed by a famous preposterous-modernist architect Tomás Taveira, emulating the steel language of cranes and port facilities. For almost 20 years, it stayed empty and unsellable. When it was acquired in 1996, little by little the surroundings changed, pushed by nearly 1,800 students and 200 faculty staff who come and go daily every academic year. Now it is a trendy area also populated by other art and design schools, the headquarters of a major power company, plus stylish law-firms and tech companies.This is now a place of “food projects”, regional or political, from France to Mexico to Thailand. One of my favourites is a pizzeria owned by a young Italian couple who, like many, coasted here because of surf and a sort of Californian flair. These restaurants thrive on the hesitations of tourists regarding polvo à lagareiro, alheiras, bacalhau à gomes de sá, bitoques and other enigmatic Portuguese menu items, offering the reassurance of universal pizza, French cuisine and burgers.Our life drawing classes also take us out and about in the city. For perspective and landscape, we work in Centro Cultural de Belém – CCB. It is a place with an intense cultural program, auditoriums, several conference rooms, art galleries and lots of fancy commerce. Museum Berardo, also lodged here, holds a remarkable collection of modern art. The building is a compound with streets and squares dominated by a strict modularity and orthogonal organisation making it perfect for understanding perspective.Inside the CCB compound is the appealing Jardim das Oliveiras, a platform garden terrace facing the river. From there we work on capturing landscape, painfully creating a 360-degree panorama composed of eight drawings.Further to the west, close to the final stop of the speedy tram number 15 that swallows and regurgitates crowds of tourists, we find Aquário Vasco da Gama, which has stood there since 1898. It holds the King Carlos I oceanographic collection of specimens, gathered and preserved in pristine flasks, as well as models of bigger marine beasts. On the lower floor we are poltergeisted by several small tanks with remarkable live fish, which the students use for movement studies. The star, however, is a giant squid, resting in a vitrine coffin.Another place we usually visit for drawing sessions is the Museu Geológico in Rua da Academia das Ciências. The museum is housed in the same building that hosts the Academy. This is probably one of the loveliest street in Lisbon. On one side the gardens of almost Edwardian houses jut over garages, and on the other side stands the unassuming Academy façade and restrained working-class houses. The street ends in a narrow passageway to Rua do Século (also a candidate for loveliest street) crowned by a photogenic arch.Back in the IADE school building, I work in the professors’ room, so busy that sometimes I find myself totally alienated from the delightful urban landscape outside my window. Some days I notice the horizontal sunset light bathing the western side of the Bairro Alto hill only while packing my laptop, which I squeeze into the backpack along with my chlorine-smelling swimming gear.From the front side windows we used to see cruise ships docking at a shabby multipurpose terminal. Back then, only the boldest tourists would risk stepping down from these luxury vessels, imagining they were in Ceuta of the 17th century. Now they roam the city in tuk-tuks like Kafka’s king’s messengers, shaken until lunch blends totally with an afternoon drink, intoxicated by the drivers’ (often wrong) shouted explanations about the history of neighbourhoods and landmark buildings. The contribution of such groups to the city economy is questionable, since the ships pollute like hell and usually the tourists don’t even eat ashore thanks to the ships’ all-inclusive packages.By the end of the afternoon I’m back in Jardim das Amoreiras. French soccer moms pack in next to youthful groups and middle age locals around a kiosk that serves drinks and snacks. A playground attracts kindergarten toddlers and their exhausted parents. A television screen sometimes shows a football game. The tourists staying in the surrounding hotels and Airbnb apartments are absent, lingering still near the old centre or in the Belém attractions.Ullisabona, Olisipo, Lisboa: mythologically founded by Ulysses, she has seen Vasco da Gama depart and Columbus arrive, astonished Voltaire and seduced Madame Junot. Admired by Hans Christian Andersen, she was spied on by Ian Fleming, saddened by Amalia and suffocated by Salazar, energised by Eusebio and is today inhabited by Madonna. In her tenacity and reinvention she is like an old vampire woman lingering in her eternity, enjoying this renewed drug of tourism. She will be cruel to unfit people, will sarcastically destroy flipflop users’ feet and bachelorettes’ high heels, resent loud drinkers, and despise those who pretend to own her. But those who spend unhurried time carefully observing her light she will seduce utterly.Eduardo Côrte-Real teaches drawing, visual culture, illustration and comics at IADE- Universidade Europeia.

Does it always though, Amber? There is currently no job in the UK with less dignity than cabinet minister. Desperate people are doing things for crack rocks round the back of disused warehouses that are significantly more dignified than signing up to Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament, even when you said it was the last thing you’d ever do about 10 minutes ago.So who are they, this prorogue’s gallery? In one sense, they’re anyone who hasn’t resigned when a minority government lies in order to execute this dick move – which is to say, literally all of them apart from George Young, a whip in the Lords who quit on Thursday. To put that in perspective, Young once reportedly described the homeless as “the people you step over when you are coming out of the opera”. So anyone who hasn’t walked from this government has been morally outclassed by that guy.But along with Rudd, those who explicitly ruled out prorogation include the Saj. On Thursday night, the chancellor had his special adviser summoned to Downing Street by Dominic Cummings, then fired and escorted from the premises. Did the Saj watch manfully through the net curtains of No 11? Will he be the first to punch his own reflection in the bathroom mirror because he just can’t face himself? Or will it be culture secretary Nicky Morgan, whose former prorogation verdict – “clearly a mad suggestion” – should double as her LinkedIn biography?Or Matt Hancock, who started his summer doing a leadership bid photoshoot with a horse, declaring “prorogation would mean the end of the Conservative party”? Look at him now. Look at Matt Hancock now. Has a chap in a V-neck T-shirt ever been so horrifyingly out of his depth? Matt Hancock is the guy in a Sky One drama about a stag weekend who ends up properly sobbing on a Cyprus cliff at 4am, as they tip a 5ft 8in polythene-wrapped package off it, screaming at the best man: “This is so fucked up! You said it was going to be fun! I’M MEANT TO BE GETTING MARRIED NEXT WEEK!”And so to the best man. According to today’s Times, Cummings has ordered the government’s £100m no-deal public information campaign to launch next week, under the slogan “GET READY”. Apparently, Cummings “knows exactly what he’s doing with the timing of this”. When doesn’t he? Mugs and T-shirts bearing the slogan have been ordered for Whitehall.Divulging this plan to the paper, a campaign source pants: “Dom Cummings is bringing a submachine gun to a knife fight.” Ooooooooooh! Is this supposed to be as swashbuckling as when that guy pulls a sword but Indiana Jones just gets out his pistol and shoots him? Because unlike seemingly everyone in Cummings’ Westminster orbit, I’m getting a flat zero reading on my frisson-ometer. Maybe it’s because the EU can bring a barrel bomb to the same knife fight? Still, tell me something, O anonymous briefer: when Cummings takes five minutes for refreshment in Whitehall, do a bunch of ministers whisper “Diet Coke break, girls!”, then rush to the window and fan themselves while watching him delve around in his ethical tote for another basic bitch strategy from Steve Bannon’s playbook? Because you all come off like you do.All in all, there were very few bright spots in this dark political week. At least we haven’t seen Dominic Raab for a while. The foreign secretary is imagined to have been given time off to deal with the problematic contents of his lock-up, dispatched by Cummings with the words: “I don’t know and I don’t want to know. You’ve got two days to sort it. Shapps’ll help you.”Elsewhere, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, solemnly explained: “The car industry’s ‘just-in-time’ supply chains rely on fluid cross-Channel trade routes … We need to start talks now on how we make sure this flow continues if we leave without a deal.” Now? Just-in-time supply chains are a concept so simple and so widely understood so long ago that it probably formed the basis of a three-episode story arc of Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service in early 2017. Great to have you onboard the train towards a clue, secretary of state!Steve’s fellow passengers include many of the alleged forces against no deal, who seem to have dimly realised the government is both shameless and ruthless. Yes, though some of them have spent a lifetime telling everyone the Tories are monsters who never stop at anything, it’s almost as if they forgot to tell themselves. For so many opponents of no deal – from Labour to some Tories to the Lib Dems and beyond – the politics of moving to make it impossible were painful, so they put it off till the absolute 11th hour.They looked caught on the hop this week. I’m reminded of a Daily Show moment where Jon Stewart wondered at an interviewer asking George W Bush if he believed in king. “Does he believe in king? He believes in EXECUTING THE RETARDED. Of course he believes in king.” We can’t salute that terminology, but you get the point. Many of these people have spent years telling us that the government cheerily kill its own citizens with austerity. Put like that, it feels unlikely they were going to suddenly draw the taste line at using an executive instrument.Perhaps the general getting-of-shit-together will happen “just in time”. And yet, perhaps it won’t. I hate to adapt a Cummings mug slogan, but maybe all sorts of people should have “GOT READY” rather earlier than they did?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

The additional funding will increase to £4.8bn in 2021-22 and £7.1bn in 2022-23.The chancellor, Sajid Javid, will also place the focus in next Wednesday’s spending review on starting to reverse the longtime underfunding of further education colleges.Javid, who himself attended an FE college, will announce a £400m injection into 16-19 education next year, which he said was the biggest increase for a decade.Writing in the , Javid said: “I want this investment to start to end the snobbishness in some quarters about the quality and importance of a vocational education. It was a FE college that equipped me with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions.”While Javid has insisted there will be no blank cheque for any government department, schools funding is widely regarded as a pressing priority and a chance for Boris Johnson to show that his government will drop the austerity policies of its predecessors.Johnson said: “When I became prime minister at the start of the summer, I promised to make sure every child receives a superb education regardless of which school they attend or where they grew up. Today I can announce the first step in delivering on that pledge: funding per pupil in primary and secondary schools will increase and be levelled up across the entire country.”Jules White, a headteacher who launched the Worth Less? campaign by school leaders for higher funding, said schools in England would need to see how much they would receive in real terms before passing judgment.“It is clear that the major funding crisis that has blighted schools and post-16 provision is now being taken seriously by the government,” White said. “But while the government’s headline figure is for £14bn, the actual increase in total spending on schools may be half of this, at £7.1bn. We also need to know how our real-terms spending power will be affected by rising student numbers and other inflationary costs.”The government said per-pupil funding would rise at least in line with inflation. Labour said the increase would not be sufficient to reverse long-term spending cuts.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “This comes nowhere close to meeting the prime minister’s pledge to reverse the Tories’ education cuts, let alone matching Labour’s plans to invest in a national education service. Instead it is yet another con trick by a politician who has shown time and again that you just can’t trust his promises.”Johnson has made schools funding one of his key domestic priorities. A nationwide backlash against school funding cuts became one of the key difficulties for many Conservatives in the 2017 general election, with many MPs reporting back to Downing Street that they had not anticipated the level of anger they encountered.Theresa May hoped to announce a new education funding settlement in the final days of her administration, but the plan was vetoed by her chancellor, Philip Hammond, who was cautious about opening the spending taps while a no-deal Brexit remained a possibility.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This schools funding announcement should really come with a note of apology the government has for so long derided our campaign and said there was no problem with education funding. Nevertheless, the funding announced today is very positive.”A number of headteachers that the  spoke to were wary of the government’s figures, citing previous occasions when funding announcements had been less generous than first presented, and some said the extra cash would not be enough even if delivered as advertised.Some heads suggested that few schools – mainly those concentrated in the most poorly funded regions – would benefit from the minimum funding pledge of £5,000 per secondary pupil and £4,000 per primary pupil. One senior head estimated that only one out of 10 schools would see a significant benefit.The leaked paper put a focus on tackling poor behaviour in schools, a measure apparently informed by recent polling that suggested strong public support for tougher disciplinary measures. The paper included explicit support for headteachers who used “reasonable force” in their efforts to improve discipline.Johnson said: “My government will ensure all young people get the best possible start in life. That means the right funding, but also giving schools the powers they need to deal with bad behaviour and bullying so pupils continue to learn effectively.”The document suggested that the Treasury had “firmly” rejected a radical attempt to improve recruitment by making teacher training courses free for students – an idea understood to have been popular with the previous education secretary, Damian Hinds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdab240dceee4310fc6779c6b205626fdd5414ea/0_142_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4af83a6f0c82ef8d661a98cb96a29b2","title":"great barrier reef outlook now very poor australian government review says","story":"Five-yearly report says climate change is escalating the threat and window of opportunity for action is nowThe outlook for the Great Barrier Reef has deteriorated from poor to very poor according to an exhaustive government report that warns the window of opportunity to improve the natural wonder’s future “is now”.The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s outlook report, published every five years, finds coral reefs have declined to a very poor condition and there is widespread habitat loss and degradation affecting fish, turtles and seabirds.It warns the plight of the reef will not improve unless there is urgent national and global action to address the climate crisis, which it described as its greatest threat.The report says rising sea temperatures and extreme events linked to climate change, such as the marine heatwaves that caused mass coral bleaching in the northern two-thirds of the reef in 2016 and 2017, are the most immediate risks.Other major threats include farming pollution, coastal development and human use, such as illegal fishing. The report says water quality is improving too slowly and continues to affect many inshore areas, largely due to farming practices that had not improved rapidly enough.“Without additional local, national and global action on the greatest threats, the overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef’s ecosystem will remain very poor, with continuing consequences for its heritage values also,” the report says.“The window of opportunity to improve the reef’s long-term future is now.”The authority’s chief executive, Josh Thomas, said the reef was widely recognised as one of the best managed marine protected areas in the world and its world heritage values remained intact, but it was at a critical point in its history.“While the reef is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, its future is one we can change – and are committed to changing,” he said.The report maps the health of the reef, which it says has declined from what was described as a crossroads in 2009 to “under pressure” in 2014 to being a “changed and less resilient reef” in 2019.It says not all areas of the reef have been equally affected and the challenge to restore the reef is big, but not insurmountable. It would require action to effectively address the climate crisis and effective implementation of the government’s 2050 reef plan.The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the reef had been hit over the past five years by two mass coral bleachings, several cyclones, an ongoing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and the impacts of climate change. She said the “very poor” outlook was something “we can change and are committed to changing”.Other key findings of the report include that: seagrass meadows are in poor condition some species populations are being substantially affected by habitat loss and degradation the size of the reef is becoming a less effective buffer to widespread and cumulative impacts reef-dependent economies need to prepare for the impacts of a less erse ecosystem caused by rising ocean temperatures.The outlook report was one of two major reports published about the reef on Friday. A separate report card on the condition of inshore reefs released by the federal and state governments rated their condition in 2017-18 as a “D”, largely due to poor water quality driven by land management practices including farming.The reports come amid a campaign by farmers in Queensland against state government plans to tighten regulations on agricultural run-off that flows into reef catchments. Information in the report will form part of the evidence considered by the Unesco world heritage committee when it examines the reef’s health and status next year.Australia successfully campaigned in 2015 for the reef’s world heritage listing not to be considered in danger.  reported this week that the government was pushing Unesco to resolve how it would deal with climate impacts on world heritage properties, including the Great Barrier Reef.Richard Leck, from WWF-Australia, said the outlook report was a sombre reminder of the challenges facing the reef. He said solutions were available and must be included in a revamped Reef 2050 plan due from the federal and state governments next year.He said the plan must take climate change seriously and Queensland needed to pass regulations to reduce farm runoff.“The science is irrefutable. The time for delay is over,” he said.Jon Brodie, a professorial fellow at James Cook University in Townsville, said the report showed that, while there were some small areas of progress, Australia was failing the reef.“Overall, there is very little good to report whatsoever,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e7a1c7d96f07f29df40d895033f046ddbfc499/341_471_3659_2195/master/3659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f94b58e50535ff065025d11e4f390f72","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A rabbit in a buckwheat field and armadillos and snakes challenged by wildfires in Bolivia and the Amazon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

In the space of a generation, Brits have tripled their consumption of snacks – and the options are endlessBritain has undergone many food revolutions over the last generation olive oil has moved from pharmacist’s shelf to store-cupboard staple we’ve seen a boom in gin, and an even bigger one in veganism. But there is one that has gone less remarked – what Praveen Vijh calls “the snackification of Britain”.Vijh is 52 and grew up in Solihull during the era of Monster Munch and Wagon Wheels, both launched in the late 1970s. “There was very little snacking,” he says. “You might have half a Twix. Snacking was a big treat.” Official figures bear this out. In 1977, the year Monster Munch was launched, the average adult in Britain consumed 29g of crisps, nuts, seeds, popcorn or savoury snacks each week, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) figures. That’s less than a bag of crisps. Fast-forward to 2015, the most recent year for which we have such detailed data, and the figure is 89g, the equivalent of very nearly three bags of crisps. In the space of a generation, we have tripled our consumption of snacks – if not more: Defra’s figures do not include the myriad of other products now sold in the snack aisles, from cashew quinoa bars at Aldi to Itsu crispy seaweed thins at Waitrose.When did snacking become not only part of our everyday diet, but a fiercely fought battleground for supermarkets and food brands desperate to persuade us that their product can do us good? Even Cathedral City, Britain’s biggest cheese brand, has started packaging its product in 100-calorie “snack bars”. In reality, this is no more than a small slice of cheese, but one that the company describes on the pack as “high in protein, an ideal snack for on-the-go”, sold in Shell petrol stations alongside fizzy drinks.At Eat Natural, Vijh argues that one thing above all others is driving this trend: we are working longer and harder than ever before. That means many consumers, such as Malone, are missing meals, especially breakfast. “Consumers are leaving home earlier in the morning. This is not only in London, this is also in Nottingham, this is also in Birmingham – everywhere that we can see it’s absolutely on the increase,” he says, explaining that he receives data from every WHSmith, supermarket and railway station shop detailing the time of day people buy an Eat Natural bar. He says a decade ago the peak time was 11am. “It is now from seven or even 6.30 in the morning. That’s the biggest trend I’ve seen over the last 10 years.”The slow demise of the nuclear family has also played a part. “Living in inidual, smaller-person households has meant we’re not sitting down to eat as a family as much,” Vijh says. Malone shares a house with four other people and says that though they may not all sit down to share a meal together, they do snack together. “In the evening when I come home from work, my flatmates and I will often sit and watch TV with a large pack of tortilla chips or popcorn.” While her snacking at work is strictly healthy, in the evening it’s not. “If we don’t have any snacks in the house, it’s a crisis and someone has to go out and buy some.” Malone and her flatmates are precisely the people the big brands are trying to attract: health-conscious, but willing to indulge.It’s not only Unilever, with its purchase of Graze, that wants a slice of this. The past two years have seen a spike in snacking acquisitions: Kellogg’s bought the American protein bar company RXBar for $600m (£483m) PepsiCo, the parent company of Walkers, spent $200m buying Bare Snacks, which specialises in banana chips, as part of its mission to “make more nutritious products” and Mars, the confectionery giant, took a large stake in Kind, the cereal bar company, valuing the latter at $4bn. Mars said the Kind acquisition would help anchor “a newly formed global health and wellness platform”.And this is only the food giants there are tons of smaller startups trying to muscle in on the market. According to Nielsen, the market research company, an eye-popping 1,780 different snacking products were launched on to Britain’s shop shelves last year – everything from sweet chilli black-eyed pea puffs to oven-baked spelt bites and salted caramel beans.One supermarket, in particular, has encouraged this snack explosion: Sainsbury’s. Like all of the “big four” supermarkets, it is under intense pressure from the two German discount chains, Aldi and Lidl, which have chipped away at its market share. Its failed attempt to merge with Asda has left it scrabbling around for a convincing approach. One answer is snacking – specifically, offering customers a large number of unusual treats. “Our strategy is to give more reasons for customers to choose us,” explains Rachel Eyre, head of Future Brands at Sainsbury’s. “And one of the ways we want to do that is by offering innovative, exciting brands that you can’t find in other supermarkets.” In return for putting these small, start-up labels on a prominent “Taste of the Future” shelf, these brands commit to supplying only Sainsbury’s for an agreed period of time.Eyre is interested in everything from kombucha to craft gin, but focused on snacks. “Adult snacking in particular is very competitive. That’s because it sits at the intersection of this spaghetti junction of consumer trends, which means there is a huge amount of entrepreneurial heat,” Eyre says. The roads meeting in her junction metaphor are: our “busier on-the-go” lifestyles, and the joint rise of an interest in health and “premiumisation”, the phenomenon whereby consumers are occasionally willing to splash out on upmarket products. She adds: “I think of it as credits and debits: consumers are looking to make healthier and more considered choices. That means when they do indulge, they want to do so properly.”A prominent protein count written on the front, combined with a message about the company either transforming you – or the world – into something better, has become a key strategy in the healthy snack market. And it works, according to Eyre. In a bid to understand its customers’ emotional reaction to marketing or packaging, Sainsbury’s has recruited volunteers and rigged them up with heart scanners, sweat detection monitors and even eye-tracking headsets, observing them as they wander through the aisles. “We know where they are engaged around the stores, and that they are drawn to these stories,” she says. “These messages definitely resonate and, crucially, they go on to put those items in their basket.”One such brand is Yaar, which calls itself a “Nordic quark bar”, though it is made in Estonia by a Ukrainian who went to boarding school in England and then became a pharmaceutical entrepreneur in Singapore. Andrei Garbuz, 37, says the business of selling painkillers and selling snacks is very similar. “I saw a huge trend: the convergence of healthcare and food businesses. So I decided that if I was to start a new business, it would be a food business with a tilt into health. It’s a huge opportunity. Humanity is going back to Ayurveda – eating better for your health.”Quark is a fermented high-protein dairy product similar to yoghurt or cream cheese. The problem is that it is nearly always eaten out of a pot – so Garbuz has coated his quark in chocolate to make it an “on-the-go, no-spooning snack format”, available from the chiller cabinet. I found them a bit sickly, like a rich mini-cheesecake, but I can see that for those with a very sweet tooth they might be a treat that, at 140 cals, doesn’t blow the daily calorie count. Garbuz argues that “no-spooning is a radical concept”, delivering nutrients “in a permissible dosage”.His use of medical terminology is not an accident. Increasingly, snacks have become meal replacements and consumers do not want to have to scan the nutrient smallprint on the back they want just a simple message on the front. And where once it was calories, it is protein that has become the most appealing shorthand for healthy. According to Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze: “Consumers are willing to pay far more for high-protein snacks. It started in the fitness community, people who went to the gym and were interested in building muscle. But now it’s far more about feeling full. Protein, in the consumer’s mind, helps fill you up, so you can eat a high- protein snack and it satiates. That’s important if there’s a missed lunch.”The protein fad helps explain the surprising rise of meat snacks while they may be high in salt or fat, they are very high in protein and so, according to Rosie While, product developer at Marks \u0026amp Spencer, represent “positive snacking”. While developed a new range of serrano ham, chorizo and salami crisps for this summer – not potato crisps, but actual slices of meat, air-dried and crunchy. While says the trend for air-drying has been particularly embraced by millennials, in contrast to their parents’ generation, who were more keen on calorie-counting. “It’s all about good ingredients, rather than bad ingredients that are being controlled by a certain calorie limit.” Still, she admits that the serrano ham crisp (99 calories a pack) is significantly outselling the chorizo and salami (130 calories). While points to 100 calories as the magic number many people still look for. “We do know that anything under 100 calories is something a customer will aim for if they are trying to be healthy.”Now that protein has gone mainstream, the next big trend is fibre. Vijh at Eat Natural argues that consumers are increasingly interested in gut health, as well as the growing number of studies that have associated diets high in fibre with a lower incidence of heart disease. “Fibre isn’t very sexy, but we know that people aren’t consuming enough of it,” he says. “It’s nothing new – my parents used to give us prunes for breakfast.” Graze now has a large number of snack boxes flagged as high in fibre, while even Walkers has launched a premium range of snacks (dried vegetable and nut mixes, pea and bean sticks) called Off The Eaten Path, some of which highlight fibre content.Vijh first experimented with a fibre bar a couple of years ago, and got it wrong. “We called the bar Better Inside, and did it a bit artificially using chicory root fibre,” a tasteless substance that Vijh admits had the texture of talcum powder. “That made the product taste a little bit weird, to be quite honest – just dry and powdery.” This summer he tried again, with a dark chocolate and sea salt bar called Fibre Packed, using figs as the main source of fibre. Is it still weird? “No, it’s delicious,” he says. “People have an aversion to highly processed ingredients. They want ingredients they recognise.”We finish our tour of the factory and head up to Vijh’s office, where his desk is surrounded by boxes of cereal bars and jars of ingredients that his developers are experimenting with (tomato powder and rice syrup, hinting at the Willy Wonka-ish possibility of a savoury cereal bar). I ask Vijh if he’s excited by the “snackification” of Britain, expecting an enthusiastic response. But he answers rather wistfully: “Actually, I would love to go back to the days where we used to all sit down together and eat meals as a family. I hope we don’t become a nation where we eat nothing but snacks.”But as the market intensifies, a return to the era of three square meals looks unlikely. I ask Malone if she could cope without her hit of Graze protein bites at work, or popcorn in the evening? “Good god! I am such a snacker. It’s something I do every day.” She laughs. “What would I do with my hands?”2004After decades of rectangular flapjacks and cereal bars, Bounce introduces the world to the spherical protein hit.2008Graham Bosher, a former executive at DVD subscription service LoveFilm, launches Graze, sending parcels of fresh fruit through the post. It moves into nuts and dried fruit after consumers complain about slices of pineapple sitting on their doormats.2010Joe \u0026amp Seph’s, a gourmet popcorn brand inspired by Garrett Popcorn Shops in Chicago, launches in Selfridges.

But a very posh, expensive one. You still queue, order, ship your own drinks and sit open-plan, but it’s £14 for a small ham sandwich. The credit card machine asks you for a tip immediately before every transaction.” Too far, one may think. But no, the Arcade Food Theatre has arrived, boasting a name like a My Bloody Valentine spin-off project and a London location so central it’s literally underneath Centrepoint, within footfall of the hungry hordes who ransack Oxford Street Primark. It should not be a difficult place to sell food. The nearby branch of Chopstix is serving boxed noodles and hot spring rolls (15 for £2.50), hand over fist, from 10am-10pm every day. Yet most things are difficult in this food court – apologies, this “collection of independent kitchens and incubation-focused mezzanine space showcasing emerging culinary concepts”.The lineup is beyond doubt impressive, with the likes of delightful, growingly cultish bakery Pophams and Casita do Frango, who do posh piri piri chicken incredibly well in Borough. Oklava, Lina Stores and Pastorcito all have incredible pedigrees, bringing their Turkish, Italian and Mexican specialities to the mix. Arcade Food Theatre is a billion miles removed from loading a tray with Spud-U-Like and Taco Bell at Manchester Arndale Centre Food Court, or eating a streetfood burger at a picnic table under a railway arch. This place is luxuriously built and exhaustingly modern, like a “funky”, “hip” hotel one books for a European minibreak, which, within minutes, makes you weep for the dependable functionality of a Premier Inn.The concept, as far as I see it – and it’s heavily open for debate – is that one orders food at the inidual counters, and they make it from scratch, in anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. There is seating near the counters. No signage anywhere informs the newbie where or how one should sit, pay, or collect food. There is nothing as gauche or functional as a buzzer to inform you the food is ready. There are no drinks available at many of the food stands. One is required to queue again at the cocktail bar area, where a small glass of Coca-Cola is £2.50 plus an immediate hustle for a tip.Arcade Food Theatre does not do takeaway. In an age when Deliveroo is king and restaurants are bending over backwards to ship food out to offices and commuters in any way possible, they do not have boxes and look genuinely shocked you’d want one. “We cannot maintain the standard,” I’m told at Tou, the upstairs “incubation kitchen”, which according to the internet opens at 8am, but when I went for breakfast on a Saturday at 11am, I was told they open, maybe, at 1pm. I gave up on food that time and went straight to the bar for a pretty good bloody mary. Tou specialises in the “sando”, which is a Japanese word for “we are sticking a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet between two slices of brioche while playing Mr Wendell by Arrested Development semi-ironically – give me £14 plus tip”.On my second jaunt to Arcade Food Theatre, I whipped through around £33 in about half an hour. London’s best almond croissant, from Pophams, costs £3.80 and a latte another £3. At Oklava, I chose a freshly baked, cheese and butter, Black Sea pide, which makes Turkish people sigh when it is compared to pizza, but alas, it’s hard to avoid. At about six inches, with egg yolk, black garlic and za’atar, it was delightful, definitely decadent and punchily priced at £12. Returning to Tou, I chose the tofu sando: chopped boiled egg laced with wasabi mayonnaise, spring onion and fresh coriander with two pockets of breaded, deep-fried silken tofu between brioche-like Japanese milk bread, for £10.50. This feisty blend is clearly someone, somewhere’s idea of a delicious sandwich, and I thoroughly respect that.This sando has graced dozens of Instagram feeds, where diners who were given it for free at the opening parties said they had an amazing, thoroughly seamless experience at this brilliant, clever new food-hall concept and that this was the greatest sandwich ever. Frankly, I don’t believe them.Arcade Food Theatre, 103-105 New Oxford Street, London, WC1A, 020-7519 1202. arcade-london. Open Mon-Sat 8am–12am, Sunday 10am-10.30pm.

Email feast@theI’ve never got the hang of fried eggs. Mine either end up raw, burned or with a texture akin to Haribo.Stephen, StockportWe shouldn’t be afraid to go back to basics, Stephen. Take comfort in the words of Spanish chef and restaurateur José Pizarro: “Eggs can be the easiest thing in the world to make, but also the most difficult.” So consider this eggs 2.0.“It sounds like your pan is way too hot,” says Miles Kirby, chef director of London’s Caravan group and master of all things brunch. Starting with a good, nonstick pan, he says, will relieve some of the need to have the temperature just right. Size also matters: “Make sure you’re not overcrowding the pan: fried eggs only take a few minutes to cook, so it doesn’t matter if you’re cooking them one at a time.” Few weekends are ruined by waiting an extra few minutes for brekkie.Kirby follows in his mother’s footsteps and fries in oil, usually vegetable – sometimes rapeseed, but never olive – as favoured by the likes of Jamie Oliver. “Olive oil has a flavour I don’t particularly care for with my fried eggs.” However, it’s this flavour (and lower acidity) that makes olive oil a winner in Pizarro’s book: “I always, always use it: just a little, heated until smoking” (note: cold whites hitting a not-hot-enough pan are going to stick).Whichever way you go, oil, Kirby advises, is the key to getting that crisp, brown base, whereas butter “tends to steam the eggs a little because of the water content”. Unsurprisingly, Michel Roux Jr, chef patron at Le Gavroche and a Frenchman, hangs his hat on butter, heating “until frothy” before cracking in the egg. Feast’s perfectionist Felicity Cloake is also Team Butter, instead adding the egg once it has melted “but not begun to foam”. Cloake and Pizarro adopt a similar approach by basting the whites with the fat after a couple of minutes, avoiding even a mere splash on the yolk. Secret fat option number three comes from Delia Smith: bacon. However, as you’re unlikely to be putting away enough rashers to have sufficient supplies of fat, we’ll park this one here.As ever, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, let them come up to room temperature before cracking – starting with a cold egg, Cloake says, means you’re more likely to overcook the yolk trying to get the white to set. Fresh eggs are best for frying as they’re less likely to spread in the pan (the stronger the proteins in the white, the neater the shape) – but, Cloake suggests, if you’re struggling to perfect those whites, a slightly older egg that spreads and therefore gives a thinner white could work to your frying advantage. Pizarro breaks his eggs into a bowl or cup first, before sliding into a hot pan where, on landing, it should sizzle and spit a little.A lid, just smaller than the pan, is also a trusted ally: “When the bottom of the egg is cooked to your liking, put a lid on top, take it off the heat and the residual heat will cook the egg,” says Kirby. Roux waits for the white to “frizzle” before covering and turning off the heat and leaving for a minute, while Cloake covers and leaves on a low heat for three and a half minutes. Seasoning should then be done at the last minute.Some suggest crispy whites and soak-up-with-toast yolk success can be found in separating the eggs: frying the whites and adding the yolk in the last few minutes of cooking. This seems like a lot of faff, especially when there are much simpler ways to crack (sorry) this.Have you got a culinary dilemma?

In turn, house price growth is unlikely to pick up again this year,” he said.Many commentators said a flat market could almost be viewed as a positive when the wider political backdrop was so uncertain. Jonathan Samuels, the chief executive of the property lender Octane Capital, said: “Based on this week’s high political drama, it’s looking like August could be the quiet before the storm.

It’s buckle up the seatbelt time for UK bricks and mortar.”Similarly, Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said that as the Brexit drama intensified over the coming weeks, the property market would have to “hunker down and ride it out”.He added: “More cautious buyers are battening down the hatches and waiting until the storm has passed before committing.”Meanwhile, data from the Bank of England for the previous month, July, showed that the number of mortgages approved in the UK hit a two-year high.UK lenders approved 67,300 mortgages in July, up from 66,500 in June. This was the highest figure since July 2017 but the Bank of England said it “remains within the very narrow range seen over the past two years … Mortgage market activity has remained stable.”The increase may reflect some sellers accepting an offer to ensure the sale is completed before 31 October. Other buyers want to be in their new property before the new school year begins in the autumn.

The settled status scheme has been running since March for EU nationals living in the UK to establish their permanent right to live in the UK. In his first House of Commons speech Boris Johnson emphasised that applicants could expect “absolute certainty for the right to live and remain” and said: “I repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us.”At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.The cause of the jump is unclear. Some applicants may have pressed the wrong button during the online application process, inadvertently accepting the less secure status. Campaigners have also questioned whether the system is designed to favour awarding pre-settled status in complex cases, so the Home Office can avoid having to refuse any applications during a politically sensitive period.In the past week a number of long-term UK residents have gone public with their concerns that they have been wrongly given pre-settled status. Among them was the chef Richard Bertinet, who has lived in the UK since 1998 and said he felt “betrayed”. Meanwhile the pro-Brexit Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan warned that he was seeing EU nationals being denied settled status, despite years of residence in the UK, and called on the home secretary to address this “before we end up with another Windrush scandal”.The Home Office says it has not rejected anyone who has applied for the scheme, and to date has granted either settled status or pre-settled status to over a million applicants.“This is semantics. Granting someone pre-settled status when they should have been given settled status should be seen as a refusal,” said Chris Desira, an immigration lawyer and expert on the EU settled status scheme. He said the Home Office was attempting to present the granting of pre-settled status as a success, but he warned that this was a less secure immigration status and urged those who felt they had been wrongly awarded this status to challenge the decision. “You should be worried,” he added. “Your leave in the UK is more precarious.”Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the EU citizens’ campaign group the3million, said he believed the Home Office was anxious to avoid media stories of EU citizens being declined status. “The Home Office is parking over a third of applicants in this temporary status, with no guarantee these people will be able to get settled status in the future. So it is a massive timebomb.”All of the estimated 3.6 million EU citizens resident in the UK must apply for settled status so they can continue living in the country legally once free movement ends with Brexit. Anyone who can demonstrate they have been in the country for five years is eligible for settled status, which echoes the rights they have currently.Anyone who has been in the country for a shorter time, or who has not proved definitively that they have been here for the full five years, will be granted pre-settled status, and will have to apply again for the permanent status once they have accrued five years of residence. In the meantime, they must maintain continuous residence, so will have less freedom to leave the country for extended periods, complicating life for people who need to work or study abroad.“We regularly see cases where an inidual’s residence exceeds five years but, often for no clear reason, they are not granted settled status. This is a concern because pre-settled status provides less security for citizens’ rights than settled status,” said Tahmid Chowdhury of Here for Good, a charity set up to provide free immigration services to EU citizens in the UK. “It is clear that the government does not want to be seen rejecting EU settled status applications.”Jill Rutter, director of strategy at immigration and integration thinktank British Future, said she was concerned by the rise in the number of people getting pre-settled status, and said the proportion was higher than she would have expected. Conversations with community groups supporting applicants indicated that they were seeing “people who expected to get settled status who were surprised when they got pre-settled status”, she said.She warned that those granted pre-settled status would need to be reminded by a government information campaign to upgrade the status as soon as possible.Home Office statistics do not show how many people who intended to apply for settled status were granted pre-settled status instead, but a spokesperson said staff working on the scheme were looking to grant the status people were eligible for and not refuse it.“By the end of June not a single person had been refused the status for which they applied. Nobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered, and declining, the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualify for settled status. More than 1 million people have been granted status through the EU settlement scheme so far and two-thirds of those have been granted settled status, which is in line with our expectations,” the Home Office said in a statement.People granted pre-settled status have the same rights to work, study, receive healthcare and benefits as those with settled status, the official said. However, in order to successfully upgrade the status they will have to remember to reapply by the deadline, ensure they don’t leave the UK for long stretches and not breach the criminality requirements.Although people have at least until 31 December 2020 to apply, interest in applying surged after the home secretary, Priti Patel, said free movement would end on 31 October in the event of a no-deal Brexit, lawyers said. The online system experienced technical issues last week, with long delays. The Home Office said this was not connected to a rise in applications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f224e4e590dbe02406b7af7798da0861b50cc0b/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43183bbd83730689393ad4e775c6883","title":"oliver letwin there is time to pass legislation to stop no deal brexit","story":"Oliver Letwin says law can be passed before parliament is proroguedCross-party rebel MPs said they had new optimism that measures to stop a no-deal Brexit could pass both the Commons and the Lords before parliament is prorogued, as Labour’s Tom Watson confirmed a potential bill had been drafted.Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the leading Conservative architects of plans to stop no deal, has said MPs do have time to pass legislation on it.However, MPs from different parties are believed to be still at odds over how to stop Boris Johnson from circumventing any new law – and crucially what the aim of any extension to article 50 should be, whether that be extra time for negotiations, a second referendum or a general election.Watson, who announced on Friday he was joining a legal challenge to stop the prorogation of parliament, said concrete plans were now in place.“I have taken advice on legislative solutions to challenge the prime minister’s action to stop us crashing out of the EU without a deal,” he said. “I am in discussion with colleagues in other parties and a bill to achieve this outcome has been drafted.”Letwin, who led efforts to stop no-deal Brexit this year by passing a bill with the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said “there probably is time” to get a measure to block a no-deal Brexit through parliament, involving MPs seizing control of the order paper to pass the bill in a matter of days.Opposition peers expect Tories in the Lords to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which must have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall.The Labour leader in the upper house, Angela Smith, has been taking advice on procedural mechanisms for ensuring the government cannot prevent peers from sitting for as long as it takes to get the bill through. Labour peers have been put on a three-line whip for Wednesday to Friday next week.A Labour source in the Lords said: “If the Commons does pass the bill, the government should be in no doubt that the Lords will do all it can to protect the will of the elected house.”In the Commons, a number of prominent Conservative MPs, including the former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart, have indicated they will back the efforts next week but Letwin said he was not complacent about numbers.“It’s a foolhardy person who predicts the number of MPs who will vote either way on an issue of this kind and we will just have to see whether we can acquire a majority of the required kind,” he said on Friday.“I know that there are a number of my colleagues who feel – as I do – that a disorderly no-deal exit is a very bad idea, and they have in the past been willing to come and support efforts to prevent that happening and I very much hope that will happen again.”A senior MP close to the rebels’ discussions said all efforts would be focused on passing a bill forcing the government to request an extension, but there were still question marks over how long an extension should be and for what purpose.“If the legislation is vague, as it was in the Cooper bill in April – where the extension length was unspecified – Boris could simply ask for another six hours’ extension and satisfy the legal requirement.”Letwin denied reports that the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, had broken off his family holiday to discuss “cooking up plans” with him to stop parliament being prorogued but said the pair had been in contact.“There’s no question of any MP cooking up any deal with the Speaker. You cannot do that. The Speaker has to follow the rules,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.But he added: “I have talked to the Speaker and the clerks on many occasions and will continue to do so.”On Friday, Johnson told MPs that efforts to stop no-deal in parliament were detrimental to his attempts to secure concessions from the EU.“I’m afraid that the more our friends and partners think at the back of their minds that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in, by parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need,” he said.“And so that’s why I really hope that MPs will allow the UK to do a deal and to get ready for a no-deal Brexit – and that’s the best way forward for our country.”EU officials remain concerned that the UK has so far presented no concrete proposals for replacing the backstop – the insurance policy for avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which Johnson has described as undemocratic.Johnson hopes to strike a deal at a key meeting of the European council on 17 October, and will then give MPs the chance to vote on it the following week, just days before the Halloween Brexit deadline. He insisted they would have “a lot of time” to debate the issues.“We’re coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October, and in that period, parliament is going to have a lot of time, still – and they’ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way, without actually getting it over the line,” Johnson said.“They’re going to have a lot of time for consideration, and what I want to do now, which I think is what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can’t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dcb92d2a4fcc32e1f190ffe46a5368a34338e58/0_146_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4592b9d7d56ed45f459f7438aba433f","title":"here in no deal ops we know vandalism when we see it and this is it","story":"The mood has changed among us Yellowhammered civil servants. We feel betrayed, as workers and as citizensProrogation is actually not a bad word for helping to describe the casual cruelty with which our political biosphere is being systematically gaslighted.Like the moral fabric of any self-respecting cabinet minister, this word is exceedingly flexible. It can be a noun when describing Boris Johnson’s evolution from bumbling amateur to bumbling pro rogue. It can be an adjective, too. As in, do you think people like Dominic Cummings should be the heart of government? “Why yes, I’m actually pro-rogue.”I’m one of the thousands of Yellowhammered civil servants working on no-deal preparations who had to prorogue their disbelief this week. We congregated around the screens of colleagues – subconsciously huddling together like emperor penguins – as we followed Twitter and various live-feeds reporting that Johnson had actually done what he repeatedly said he didn’t want to do, what many of his inner sanctum insisted he would never do, and what his legal team repeatedly assured Gina Miller he certainly didn’t intend to do.None of us is in any doubt about what’s just happened. This shutting down of accountability may be dressed up in the language of prorogation, and dignified by arcane royal pageantry. But it can’t disguise the smirking, smug sense of reckless entitlement that stinks of the worst kind of Bullingdon Club blowout. This is constitutional vandalism, and everyone knows it.Yes, yes, we’ve all got outrage fatigue. But I’ve genuinely never seen my colleagues so dismayed, so angry and – somehow worst of all – so disorientated. And after already enduring two rounds of Yellowhammer, that’s saying something. What’s going on?Second, the mood inside the civil service has changed, particularly here at the heart of no-deal planning operations. We feel like we’ve been betrayed, not just as demoralised workers trying to complete a Sisyphean task but as citizens too. Civil servants aren’t elected, but there is a well-established line of accountability that connects us with the public, and it’s being rubbed out at the worst possible time.As the redoubtable Hilary Benn tweeted, if parliament’s doors are closed select committees won’t be able to meet to hold our ministers’ feet to the fire on how they’re spending no-deal billions. Members of parliament won’t be able to submit parliamentary questions about exactly what we’re doing with those billions. That’s a horrid precedent which isn’t good for the civil service in the long run. And it’s certainly not good for you, the public.Third, we feel exposed to a damaging tsunami of blame that is surely around the corner. Civil servants can handle a bit of aggro – either from pissed-off ministers or members of the public. We’ve grown used to the Sturm und Drang of Brexit. We’re not bothered by protesters – most of us have had to run the gauntlet past hi-vis caballeros of every stripe and persuasion just to get to work.But what is new is the open question of whether we can, or should, obey ministerial instructions to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Many of us were shocked to hear Bob Kerslake, until 2014 the head of the civil service, suggest that civil servants should “examine their consciences” and consider “putting its stewardship of the country ahead of service to the government”.What’s next? Some MPs – like Lloyd Russell-Moyle – are calling for a general strike. Most senior union figures will be rightfully fearful of proposing this, wary that this option too would risk the public’s wrath.I agree. A rogue prime minister is bad enough. A rogue civil service won’t have a hope of keeping Britain’s lights on if the reanimated corpse of no deal strikes this Halloween. And heaven help us then.• The civil servant works in a Whitehall department and was part of Operation Yellowhammer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b12097b1ad70750ec96a176bef07c13c8c6124f/0_149_4513_2707/master/4513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92bf59a98d6f8af2d823a7131fa373ef","title":"compasses to point true north for first time in 360 years","story":"Over the past few hundred years in the UK all compass needles have pointed west of true northAt some point over the next two weeks, compasses at Greenwich will point true north for the first time in about 360 years.And for some parts of the UK, this may not happen for another 20 years. Either way, it is a once-in-a-lifetime event.The angle a compass needle makes between true north and magnetic north is called declination. As the magnetic field changes all the time, so does declination at any given location.Over the past few hundred years in the UK, declination has been negative, meaning that all compass needles have pointed west of true north.The line of zero declination, called the agonic, is moving westward at a rate of around 12 miles (20km) a year, experts say.By next month, the compass needle will point directly to true north at Greenwich in London, before slowly turning eastwards.The Royal Observatory Greenwich was established in 1676 and, from 1839, hosted the specialised magnetic observatory that made continuous measurements from 1840 onwards. In 1926, the instruments were moved to Abinger in Surrey, as electrified railway lines had made it impossible to measure the magnetic field.Dr Ciaran Beggan, a geomagnetism scientist at the British Geological Survey’s Lyell Centre in Edinburgh, said: “At some point in September, the agonic will meet zero longitude at Greenwich. This marks the first time since the observatory’s creation that the geographic and geomagnetic coordinate systems have coincided at this location.“The agonic will continue to pass across the UK over the next 15 to 20 years. By 2040, all compasses will probably point eastwards of true north.“It is, at present, impossible to predict how the magnetic field will change over decades to centuries, so the compass may well point east of true north for another 360 years in the UK.”However, the experts have stressed that zero declination will have no impact on daily life.Beggan added: “Compasses and GPS will work as usual – there’s no need for anyone to worry about any disturbance to daily life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0d0a870d9ba3bd4a155b1d3362a1bf1e57b43f/0_211_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65151fbe91263a8d381a6819e7692223","title":"help to buy loans benefited more rich than poor households","story":"Whitehall figures show over 5,500 households with annual income of £80,000 got loansMore rich households than poor ones are benefiting from a £25bn public subsidy that the former prime minister Theresa May claimed was “restoring the dream of home ownership for a new generation”.More than 5,500 households with an annual income of over £80,000 have been given help-to-buy loans in the past year compared with 4,142 households earning less than £30,000, the government’s own figures have revealed. Well over 2,000 of the richest households who were awarded taxpayer-funded loans, allowing them to buy new-build houses with only a small deposit, had incomes in excess of £100,000.The flagship scheme has previously been criticised for swelling housebuilders’ profits by creating more demand for new properties and pushing up their prices. In 2018, help-to-buy transactions underpinned about half of Persimmon’s sales as the housebuilder racked up profits of more than £1bn. However, millions of renters have not been able to afford to access the scheme.Shelter, the housing charity, which analysed data from the English Housing Survey, said it shows the policy has done little for the large majority of private renters looking for a stable home.“Help to buy is often touted by the government as a major success, when in truth it’s a major failure,” said Polly Neate, the chief executive of the campaigning charity. “It’s a policy that boosts the bank balances of big developers but has nothing to offer the average renter.”Sylvia, 42, a mother of two who rents a one-bedroom flat, said that despite earning over £35,000 she could not afford to use the help-to-buy scheme.By 2023, the net amount loaned through the scheme is forecast to peak at about £25bn in cash terms, according to the National Audit Office.“At the crux of this crisis is the desperate shortage of genuinely affordable social homes,” said Neate. “In fact, 3m more social homes are needed in the coming years. This is where the new government should be taking decisive action, and where the greatest opportunity to help trapped renters lies.”A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Whatever your background or postcode, you should have the opportunity to buy a place to call your own.“So far Help to Buy schemes have been used over 500,000 times to help families across England buy their home and we are determined to go further to help people on lower incomes on to the housing ladder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

The five-times champion won the contest in an hour and 20 minutes, the shortest completed match of the tournament.“I have heard this shit too often now,” Federer said, in an uncharacteristic outburst. “I’m sick and tired of it – that apparently I call the shots.”Evans, still heavy-legged from his rain-delayed four-set match against Lucas Pouille the previous day, left miffed that Federer, a renowned night owl at Flushing Meadows, had an obvious advantage.The Birmingham player was reluctant to lay the blame for the unhelpful scheduling directly on Federer – who had completed his quick second-round match under the roof on the Arthur Ashe stadium on Wednesday, when rain washed out matches on the outside courts – but he was not happy when his new friend, rested and sharp, blew him off the court to win 6-2, 6-2, 6-1.Evans and Federer bonded in Switzerland recently when he was invited to train with the 20-times major champion for three days but that relationship may come under a little pressure now.Evans, plainly exhausted despite the brevity of the match, said when it was put to him that Federer’s team might have asked for a daytime match: “If that is the case, it’s tough on me, isn’t it? But that wouldn’t be the first time the higher-ranked player has had pull, so to speak. Also, the tournament obviously would rather Roger be going through that match than me. So it’s understandable, yeah.”“Him being totally fresh and me battling yesterday – I didn’t get out of here until going on 6pm – just complete polar opposites, isn’t it? Trying to beat him feeling tired, stiff, playing four sets yesterday, it’s near on impossible. He played pretty much no-error tennis.Federer, normally the epitome of politeness, was close to losing his temper but did not wholly deny the suggestion that influence was brought to bear. “I don’t remember that I asked for something. It’s maybe nice to be out of the sun, as well. I don’t know. But I definitely didn’t do it intentionally. I don’t even know if the team asked for day. I knew there were questions to have a preference.“But that doesn’t mean, like, ‘Roger asks, Roger gets.’ Just remember that. Because I have heard this shit too often now. I’m sick and tired of it – that, apparently, I call the shots. The tournament and the TV stations do. We can give our opinion. That’s what we do. But I’m still going to walk out there, even if they schedule me at four in the morning.”He conceded the timing was not ideal for Evans, whom he likes and admires as a player. “It was always going to be a competitive advantage for me,” he admitted. “But I have been there. I know what you’re talking about. You could definitely argue that the scheduling was not in his favour. It’s not fair for me to play my match under the roof, get it done, sit back, relax the next day while he’s battling out a three-hour match against Pouille. The problem already starts there.“That’s tennis. That’s entertainment, and the show must go on. I’ve lost matches this way. I’ve won some this time. Luck was on my side. There you have it. I understand if Danny is a little bit frustrated.”Federer did not drop a point on his own serve in the second set, by which time the match, which had started brightly, had ceased to be a contest. There was a hush over the huge stadium as the crowd were in look-away mode, perhaps feeling as sorry for Evans as they were delighted for Federer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/025523d0fb1556b643f8ff89a10354607f4d1f84/909_479_1548_929/master/1548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8897a7d5df0790539144295e1213cf41","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

However, passengers setting off from London this weekend on the longest continuous round-the-world cruise ever will have needed deep pockets and empty diaries.At 245 days, six continents, 51 countries and 112 ports, it is the first cruise of its kind and will attempt to set a new Guinness world record.Viking Ocean Cruises has billed it as the “ultimate world cruise”. The cheapest ticket for a 25 sq metre (270 sq ft) stateroom cost £66,990 and the most expensive suite £194,390.“I suspect the type of people who can afford to go on this incredible cruise won’t be quibbling about the amount of additional tip to leave the staff,” said Keeley Rodgers, the editor of Group Leisure \u0026amp Travel and Cruise Magazine. “The mixture of guests onboard would be reason enough to go … to be a fly on the wall at dinner listening to those millionaires, lottery winners and people smart enough to have a stellar pension pot.”The eight-month odyssey will explore Scandinavia, the Caribbean, South America, the south Pacific, Australia and Asia before returning to the Mediterranean and Europe. There will be overnight stays on land in 23 cities including Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Ushuaia in Argentina, Hobart in Tasmania, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, Mumbai in India and Luxor in Egypt.The Viking Sun, which can accommodate 930 guests in 465 staterooms, all with a private balcony, is fully booked for its Sunday departure from Greenwich. In total 54 people – four from the UK, 40 from the US and 10 from Australia – have signed up for the full 245 days. The others will part ways with the liner in Los Angeles after covering half the itinerary, to be replaced by new passengers for the second half.Torstein Hagen, the chair of Viking, said: “Our ultimate world cruise is the most extensive itinerary available in the industry, nearly double the length of our previous world cruise itineraries.”Guests can swim in two pools including an infinity pool, enjoy a Nordic spa and a snow grotto where snowflakes descend from the ceiling, or relax in the winter garden under a canopy of Scandinavian trellised wood.The resident of the grand “Owner’s Suite” has at their disposal a living room with original artwork, ocean-view dry sauna, 12-person boardroom, dining room, kitchen, extensive wine collection and in-suite chef.Eight restaurants will offer 245 different menus, including destination-themed choices by guest chefs. “There is more food than you can ever imagine. But we also have a wellness theme throughout the cruise, so you can look after your nutrition, and a well-equipped gym for exercise,” said Neil Barclay, Viking’s head of sales.He pointed out the cheapest ticket worked out at around £270 per person per night, for the opportunity of leaving the winters behind, sailing into the sun and seeing all these unique places. “If you were going to a really nice hotel somewhere in the Med, to get all this included would probably cost more.”“It’s a mixture of people,” he said of the passengers. “You’ve got your savers, and its something they have always wanted to do. You’ve got your retirees. For a lot it will be a one-off, ticking the boxes.”World cruise devotees are generally well-heeled, 65-plus-types. “Cruising is very, very addictive because you become seduced by the whole lifestyle,” said Liz Jarvis, the editor of Cruise International magazine. “You are pampered from start to finish. That’s why they are so popular and why people rebook over and over again.”“It won’t be something that is exclusive to millionaires,” said Alex Loizou, director of sales and marketing at Mundy Cruising. “It will be ordinary people, and it will be people who have cruised in the past and are looking at something that little bit special to celebrate an occasion or a milestone such as retiring.”Elisa Burrai, a senior lecturer in tourism management at Leeds Beckett University, said round-the-world cruising was a “growing trend and a very dynamic industry catering mainly for people who have just retired”.She said: “It’s a rite of passage. It signals the passage from being committed to work and daily life, to something that gives us freedom and is extraordinary.” It was the exact opposite to another rite of passage, the gap year for young travellers, she said. “Cruises are a different type of travelling, with very, very minimal contact with local populations. Being on a cruise doesn’t allow these immersions with local people that gap-year and volunteer tourism offers.”It had particular appeal in the US because of its all-inclusive and risk-averse format, Burrai said. “You just go onboard, tick places off your list and travel in a safe and convenient way. They’re kind of in a bubble, almost.”The epic journey will not be without environmental impact. Marcie Keever, the oceans and vessels programme director at Friends of the Earth US, said: “Cruises have a significant impact on our environment, from CO2 emissions to harmful air pollutants to sewage and greywater. A cruise that lasts 245 days will leave a huge amount of pollution in all the places it travels to, many of which are extremely sensitive marine environments or communities that are already suffering a higher burden of pollution or both.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1cda20392cbb009b3c379d8010c8e82ae43112f/0_215_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a64641f36750b6d885c47f873b1f9e4a","title":"hurricane dorian florida latest strength path","story":"Landfall anticipated early Tuesday on state’s east coast with maximum sustained winds of 140mphResidents of Florida braced for what could be a historically damaging storm on Friday as Hurricane Dorian lingered in the western Atlantic, building strength in advance of its anticipated landfall early on Tuesday on the state’s east coast.The storm strengthened into a category 3 hurricane on Friday afternoon, amid fears it could prove to be the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida’s east coast in nearly 30 years. Forecasters warned that Dorian could wallop the state with “extremely dangerous” 140mph (225 kph) winds.“It could be an absolute monster,” Donald Trump said in a video address, pledging federal support for local disaster relief efforts.Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, declared a state of emergency for every county in the state and warned of a potential “multi-day” event, but stopped short of declaring any emergency evacuations.Emergency preparations were under way up and down the Atlantic coast, from Jacksonville in the north to Miami and the Florida Keys, as well as in Orlando and inland areas.Ominously, on Friday morning the storm had developed a distinct eye and slowed its westward progress, meaning it could spend more time over land – and do more damage.Meteorologists said Dorian could make landfall in Florida on Tuesday as a category 4 hurricane.“If it makes landfall as a category 3 or 4 hurricane, that’s a big deal,” the University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy told the Associated Press. “A lot of people are going to be affected. A lot of insurance claims.”DeSantis acknowledged fuel shortages across the state as residents formed long lines at petrol stations, supermarkets and hardware stores. Officials advised residents to stockpile canned food, water and other supplies and to refill essential prescriptions.Coastal residents were amassing sandbags against potential flooding and tacking plywood over windows and doors. Officials directed residents in the hurricane’s path to check their preparedness plan against advice on the state’s storm emergency website and to be on guard against price gouging and fraud.DeSantis announced that highway patrol cars would escort fuel trucks to expedite distribution.“We’re doing all we can on the fuel,” he said.Earlier predictions of an arrival of the storm early on the Labor Day holiday, Monday, were revised in anticipation of an early Tuesday arrival. Storm surge could be made worse by extreme tides associated with the new moon, which fell on Friday.A hurricane watch was in effect for the north-western Bahamas, with a risk of life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds. Heavy rainfall and flash flooding were anticipated in all affected areas.While it was unclear where on the Florida coastline Dorian would make landfall, Trump compared the storm to the 1992 Hurricane Andrew, which likewise tore into Florida along the Atlantic coast, killing 65 and tallying $27bn in damage.“It does seem almost certain that it’s hitting dead center, and that’s not good,” Trump said. “Somebody said bigger, or at least as big as Andrew.”Trump is traveling to Camp David in Maryland, where he will monitor the storm after he canceled his planned trip to Poland this weekend.Forecasters have put Trump’s luxury resort of Mar-a-Lago in the crosshairs of the storm. Late Friday, the National Hurricane Center’s projected track showed Dorian hitting near Fort Pierce, some 70 miles north of the so-called “winter White House”, then running along the coastline as it moved north. However forecasters cautioned that the storm’s track was still highly uncertain and even a small deviation could put Dorian offshore or well inland.The major models of the storm showed it most likely deflecting up the Atlantic coast after making landfall but the risk remained, DeSantis said, that the storm could cross Florida and move into the Gulf of Mexico, to potentially grow in strength once again over relatively warm and shallow waters.“Obviously a storm that cuts across the state, crosses the Gulf and then slams the Panhandle is a bad, bad thing for us,” DeSantis said.“Not every path of the storm has the same probability but you’ve got to be prepared for that. It’s too soon to tell.”Dorian’s approach has played havoc with people’s Labor Day weekend plans. Major airlines began allowing travelers to change their reservations without a fee. The big cruise lines began rerouting their ships. Disney World and the other resorts in Orlando found themselves in the storm’s projected path.Jessica Armesto and her one-year-old daughter, Mila, had planned to have breakfast with Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy at Disney World. Instead, Armesto decided to take shelter at her mother’s hurricane-resistant house in Miami with its kitchen full of nonperishable foods.“It felt like it was better to be safe than sorry, so we canceled our plans,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c609ee347d7a53a60cc87335798c8f13e32c178/0_80_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b16c7af416ab47bfe158a7a1ccf54c5","title":"khalid shaikh mohammad 9 11 trial start date","story":"US charged the five with war crimes that include terrorism, hijacking and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles A military judge has set a trial date for five men held at Guantánamo Bay and facing the death penalty for their alleged role in the 911 terrorist attacks – nearly 20 years after the atrocities took place.Judge Col W Shane Cohen set a start date of early 2021 in an order setting motion and evidentiary deadlines on Friday. The five defendants include Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a senior al-Qaida figure who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the 11 September 2001 attacks and other terrorist plots.The men were first charged in 2008 and military commission proceedings began in 2012 but have moved at a snail’s pace, with more than 30 pre-trial hearings and endless procedural arguments.Witnesses have died, lawyers have grown old and victims’ families patience has been sorely tested.In setting 11 January 2021 for the start of selection of a military jury, Cohen acknowledged that the trial at the base at Guantánamo Bay, the US military zone in south-east Cuba, “will face a host of administrative and logistics challenges”.The US charged the five with war crimes that include terrorism, hijacking and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support to the 911 plot, in which airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon near Washington and a field in Pennsylvania.The five could receive the death penalty if convicted at the military commission, which combines elements of civilian and military law.Mohammad, described by the the 911 commission report as the “principal architect” of those attacks, was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and held and tortured in secret CIA “black sites” in Afghanistan and eastern Europe for three years, before being flown to Guantánamo in September 2006.His co-defendants are Walid bin Attash, alleged to have run an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan where two of the hijackers were trained Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni accused of helping organise logistics for the attack Ammar al-Baluchi, alleged to have played a critical role in funding the hijackers and organising their flight school training and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, a Saudi accused of acquiring cash, credit cards and clothing for the hijackers.There is still no guarantee the trial will begin before the 20th anniversary of the 911. Cohen issued a 10-page scheduling order giving prosecutors a 10 October deadline to provide materials for the case. According to the New York Times, Cohen “begins a series of hearings next month with witnesses in an effort by the defense teams to exclude confessions the defendants made to FBI agents in early 2006 as tainted by the years of CIA torture.”Barack Obama tried and failed to close the prison on Guantánamo Bay, whereas Donald Trump pledged to “load it up with some bad dudes” and signed an executive order to keep it open. There has been little mention of the prison in the 2020 election campaign so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb46e3dab4da174aa8a44b23a24efdf9becd786/0_159_612_367/master/612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f00b1eca6f2eb3acce9d89e0f66b9f6","title":"of chechen dissident suspect linked to russian security services","story":"Research by Der Spiegel found suspect’s passport could be linked to Russian militaryA suspect arrested last week over the killing of a Chechen dissident in Berlin was carrying a passport whose number linked him to Russian security services, German media have reported.Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, who fought against Russia during the second Chechen war in the early 2000s, was shot twice in the head at close range in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in central Berlin just before midday last Friday.A Russian national who was detained near the scene after being spotted throwing a bicycle and a gun into the River Spree was carrying visa documents that identified him as 49-year-old Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, born in Irkutsk, Siberia, and based in St Petersburg.However, a person of that name could not be found in Russia’s national passport register nor in the country’s driving licence register, Der Spiegel reported. At a Paris hotel listed as a residence in the visa documents, receptionists could not recall having seen the man, the magazine’s researchers found.A joint investigation by Der Spiegel, Bellingcat and The Insider found that the passport number could be linked to a unit in Moscow’s interior ministry that in the past has issued ID documents for the military security service GRU.The findings add further fuel to suspicions of a state-backed assassination similar to the attempt carried out against the former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, Britain, in 2018.On Wednesday the Kremlin denied any involvement in the killing, which took place on the same day that Germany’s foreign minister was visiting Moscow.“I categorically reject any link between this incident, this murder, and official Russia,” said Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4002711.1567192091!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"retailers have plans to keep bread on the table in hard brexit says minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Business  Heather Humphreys Caroline Keeling, CEO pf Keelings  and Julie Sinnamon, CEO of  Enterprise Ireland at the Keelings farm shop. Photograph: Alan Betson  The Supermarket chains and retailers are putting plans in place to ensure there would be “bread on the table” in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys has said.Ms Humphreys told reporters that the Government has been working with retailers to ensure there would be “as little disruption as possible to goods coming into this country.” “I am satisfied that they will be able to deal with any issues,” she said.The minister urged businesses at an event in Dublin to “grab the Brexit bull by the horns” and take steps to prepare for the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in a disorderly no-deal departure.Speaking at the shop operated at the fruit grower and importer Keelings near Dublin Airport, the minister acknowledged that it was “extremely frustrating” for businesses that with just nine weeks to Brexit on October 31st when they did not know whether the UK would leave the EU with or without a deal. “I fully accept that the lack of clarity complicates our Brexit contingency planning. I also accept that it is incredibly difficult for businesses, especially small businesses, to plan for a situation that remains so unclear,” she said.RangeThe minister outlined again the range of Brexit-related Government supports to businesses including loans, at the publicity event but acknowledged the reluctance of businesses to take on debt in advance.“That is understandable but I want to be very clear that you are under no obligation to draw down a loan if you apply for one,” she said. Keelings sells between 10,000 and 12,000 of berries a year - roughly about 50 million punnets of fruit - and employs 2,300 people. It imports grows €30 million worth of produce on 500 acres in north Dublin and imports fruit from Egypt, Morocco, Mexico and Chile. David Keeling, chief executive of Keelings Retail, said there may need to be “a lot more” consistent shipping routes directly to mainland Europe if the transit channel through the UK, currently the quickest, cheaper and most favoured route of importers, is delayed due to congestion at the English ports after Brexit.“You would love to get the Government in with all the logistical companies and understand what’s happening and then find potential solutions in the short term if something serious happens,” he said.He said there could be shortages of some food types immediately after Brexit but that he did not expect overall shortages, he said.“It is not an easy thing to plan for,” he said. His sister Caroline Keeling, chief executive of the Dublin family business, said that managing food checks on cross-Border supplies would be a “challenge” in a hard Brexit.“There will be challenges that we haven’t thought about that will come out in November. If the attitude that is there at the moment - to try and fix everything - continues, I think we’ll get through it,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4002468.1567169219!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i m bobi wine the ugandan pop star taking on the president","story":"Musician turned politician Bobi Wine, real name Robert Kyagulanyi (37), has announced that he will run for president of Uganda in 2021. However, Wine\u0027s bid to unseat president Yoweri Museveni after 33 years has been perilous. Video: Sally Hayden\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPopstar and opposition leader Bobi Wine speaks at a campaign event in Mpigi, Uganda.  Photograph: Sally Hayden.It’s not hard to find Ugandan popstar-turned presidential candidate Bobi Wine. His northern Kampala residence, a white house surrounded by coconut trees, is listed on Google maps.That’s surprising because of the danger he’s in. In slightly more than a year, Wine has been tortured in police custody and his driver shot dead with a bullet Wine says was meant for him his friends have been arrested and his concerts and meetings shut down. His life is a constant game of cat-and-mouse with the police.Wine’s home is gated, but once I’m inside he greets me at his door, extending a tattooed arm with a slight smile and a totally unnecessary: “I’m Bobi Wine.”Wine, a thin 37-year-old whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is leading a potential revolution in Uganda. His slogan is “people power”. His supporters wear trademark red berets.It’s been two years since he entered politics, becoming the MP for his constituency Kyadondo East, on Kampala’s outskirts, after winning a byelection.In July, Wine announced he will run for president in 2021. He’s feeling confident. “Chances are I will be president,” Wine says. “We have seen from east to west, from north to south, Ugandans are yearning for change.”The self-proclaimed “ghetto president” is playing with fire. Uganda’s 75-year-old leader, Yoweri Museveni, has been in power for 33 years – longer than most of the country’s population have been alive. While Museveni also originally preached democracy and said he wanted to give citizens control, he has overseen the removal of term limits and the scrapping of a presidential age limit.“There’s no doubt that I will beat Museveni hands down at the vote,” says Wine. “Where the questions is is whether or not he will accept the voice of the people.”Catchy musicWe’re driving to his first campaign stop of the day, a Muslim funeral in Mpigi, southwest of the capital.From the car, some of the graffiti ubiquitous across Kampala is visible. “#FreeBobi”, it says, referring to Wine’s arrest last year, when he was locked up and tortured by Ugandan security forces. His treatment drew national and international attention to his campaign, in a way the country’s leadership seemingly hadn’t foreseen.“Power4People,” another piece of graffiti says.Wine found massive success as a musician, producing catchy music that has turned increasingly political. Some messaging is subtle. The video for the 2018 song Kyarenga featured two suitors trying to charm a woman.One was potbellied, thuggish and corrupt, attempting to buy the woman’s father with foreign currency the other was Wine, a young, charismatic man, who spoke of the purity of his love and eventually won her heart.More recently, Tuliyambala Engule, released seven months ago, has become an anthem. Its video shows Wine walking through flames, followed by Ugandan women and men dressed as nurses, labourers, and a motorbike driver, representing different sectors of society. “When the struggle is over we shall wear the victor’s crown. We will walk with swag in a new Uganda,” the lyrics go.Wine – and his army of volunteers – are adept at social media. They’re widely cited as the reason Uganda’s government brought in a “social media tax” last summer, meaning Ugandans must pay daily to have access.Wine’s Twitter account – which has more than 350,000 followers – describes him as a “ghetto child who has something to say through music”. He has more than 300,000 Instagram followers, and over one million fans on Facebook. The volunteers who travel with him say live streaming each campaign event protects them from police harassment.As he stops at two Muslim funerals, and then a Catholic thanksgiving, hundreds of people cheer for Wine, calling his name and thumping their fists in a “people power” salute. Boda boda drivers chase the car, delighted to be anywhere close to the man they’re already calling “president”.The schedule changes repeatedly, as Wine’s entourage try to outsmart the police they believe are tailing them. Several times, vehicles loaded with security or military men holding guns drive past us, sirens blaring. Wine’s driver tears down the wrong side of the road, or along the pavement, overtaking other cars in a bid to lose unwanted followers.Homophobic lyricsMonitoring takes other forms too. Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Ugandan government was using Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to spy on Wine. Huawei denies these claims.Wine has not always stood for the underdog. In 2014, he was denied a UK visa after activists protested over homophobic lyrics in one of his songs, which appeared to call for gay men to be attacked.Homosexuality is still criminalised in Uganda under colonial-era laws. When I ask Wine whether he still holds the same views and if he would work to repeal that legislation, he responds that he would “respect all Ugandans”, though says it’s also a matter for the public to decide.“I don’t want it to be about me, I want it to be about the people, but I would preach tolerance as a president,” he says.The past few years have seen a number of African dictators toppled, but this hasn’t always led to civilian rule. The Gambia, where the brutal and eccentric Yahya Jammeh was replaced by the democratically-elected property developer Adama Barrow, is an example of how well things can go, Wine says. In comparison, “Zimbabwe got rid of a dictator only to create another”.Many Ugandans have compared Wine to Museveni in his early days. Privately, they say there is no way to ensure he won’t repeat the same behaviours and let power go to his head. When I press Wine on this, he says he will make sure institutions to curtail his power are restored, and he will commit to serving a maximum of two terms as president. “I believe there should be very strict observation of a two-term service. Very, very strict.”Rule of lawAnswering the same question again later, his response sounds slightly less rehearsed. “It scares me, honestly, it scares me to think of how patriotic some people sounded, people like Museveni, only to turn against the people,” he says.“But I also know that even within the struggle we are empowering people to stand up, even against our own selves . . . I strongly believe that leaders must – from time to time – be reminded that people can elevate them and put them down.”If Museveni was ousted, even democratically, it is unclear what would happen next. Wine says Museveni could be an adviser to his successor. “I want him to be a respectable former president, a resident president who we look at as a person who played his part and made his mistakes, but also has a role in national healing and national reunification.”However, Wine is also calling for the “rule of law” to be reinstated, along with anything that might entail. “I believe strongly in a truth and reconciliation programme because at the end of the day justice must not only be served, but must be seen to be served.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4002407.1567164198!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how a ring of women allegedly recruited girls for jeffrey epstein","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSarah Kellen (left) and Ghislaine Maxwell have been accused in lawsuits of helping Jeffrey Epstein recruit teenage girls and young women for sex. Photograph: Patrick McMullan via Getty ImagesHaley Robson was a 16-year-old South Florida high school student when an acquaintance from school approached her at a local pool with an intriguing offer: Did she want to make extra money giving massages to a billionaire in Palm Beach?She agreed. When Jeffrey Epstein tried to grope her while she was giving him a massage in nothing but a thong, she brushed his hand away, Robson said in a 2009 deposition for a civil case. But she continued to visit Epstein’s mansion dozens more times, in a lucrative new role: a recruiter of other teenage girls from her school.“I didn’t have to convince them,” she said in the deposition. “I proposed to them. They took it.”A review by The New York Times of lawsuits, unsealed court records and depositions, along with new interviews, offers disturbing allegations about how this small cadre of women helped Epstein lure girls into his orbit and managed the logistics of his encounters with them.The urgency of the investigation into Epstein’s associates was underscored on Tuesday when about two dozen women offered searing accounts of how he had sexually abused them before a packed courtroom in Manhattan.The judge overseeing the case had invited the women to speak at a hearing to dismiss the indictment against Epstein in light of his death.Several of the women implored federal prosecutors to continue investigating the women in Epstein’s inner circle.“Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped him are,” said Teresa Helm, who said she was recruited into Epstein’s world 17 years ago. “They definitely need to be held accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one another carry on this huge – almost like – system.”The US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey S Berman, whose office brought the charges against Epstein, said after his suicide that the investigation into the sex-trafficking conspiracy was not finished and prosecutors were committed to standing up for the “brave young women” Epstein had abused.One of the women under scrutiny, Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been accused in several well-publicised lawsuits of overseeing efforts to procure girls and young women for him, a charge she has firmly denied.But Epstein is also accused in civil suits of relying on an organised network of underlings: those who trained girls how to sexually pleasure him office assistants who booked cars and travel and recruiters who ensured he always had a fresh supply of teenage girls at the ready.None of Epstein’s associates have been charged or named as co-conspirators in Manhattan. But federal authorities are eyeing possible charges that include sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy, the two people with knowledge of the investigation said.Four women were apparently so instrumental to Epstein’s operation that they were named as possible “co-conspirators” and were granted immunity from prosecution in a widely criticised plea bargain Epstein struck with federal prosecutors in Florida more than a decade ago. That deal allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state charges and to spend 13 months in a county jail rather than face a federal sex-trafficking indictment.The four women – Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Adriana Ross and Nadia Marcinkova – could still be subject to criminal charges in New York. The US attorney’s office has said it is not bound by the Florida agreement.‘The boss’Three women have alleged in lawsuits that Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring operated as a hierarchy, with the financier and Ghislaine Maxwell at the top.“She orchestrated the whole thing for Jeffrey,” Sarah Ransome, who sued Maxwell and other associates in 2017, said in an interview.Maxwell, the daughter of British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was Epstein’s longtime companion, managing his homes and introducing him to many of the politicians, celebrities and dignitaries who became fixtures within his social circle.“They were like partners in business,” Janusz Banasiak, Epstein’s house manager, said in a deposition. Epstein’s butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, described Maxwell in a deposition as “the boss”.Maxwell has vehemently denied she trafficked girls. Neither Maxwell nor her lawyers responded to requests for interviews for this article.But Epstein’s accusers contend in court papers that Maxwell managed the network of recruiters and helped devise the playbook for how to lure young women into Epstein’s web.Recruiters were allegedly told to target young, financially desperate women, and to promise them help furthering their education and careers, these civil complaints said.Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a deposition that she was 16 when she met Maxwell and was recruited as a masseuse. She said she remembered Maxwell’s sales pitch: If she gave a wealthy man a massage, a whole world of opportunity would open to her.“If the guy likes you, then, you know, it will work out for you,” Giuffre, in a deposition, recalled Maxwell telling her. “You’ll travel. You’ll make good money. You’ll be educated.”Giuffre took the job. Soon, she said, she became Epstein’s “sex slave”, not only providing sexual favours to him but also to some of his acquaintances, including politicians and prominent businessmen.“My whole life revolved around just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and Jeffrey happy,” she said in the deposition. “Their whole entire lives revolved around sex.”The ‘lieutenant’Just below Maxwell in the chain of command was Sarah Kellen, another high-ranking employee, who has been accused in multiple lawsuits of scheduling girls to have sex with Epstein in his Palm Beach mansion.She was called the “lieutenant” in one lawsuit. David Rodgers, Epstein’s pilot, said in a deposition that Kellen was “like an assistant to Ghislaine”.Kellen kept the names and numbers of all the girls who gave Epstein erotic massages, according to Palm Beach police reports and Robson’s deposition. She would call them whenever Epstein was in town, asking the girls if they were ready to “work,” the reports and Robson said.“She saw herself as the boss,” said Spencer T Kuvin, a West Palm Beach lawyer who represented several accusers in lawsuits. “Sarah was really running that organisation, bringing girls and getting them in and out of the Palm Beach home.”Kellen, who sometimes goes by Sarah Kensington or Sarah Vickers, did not respond to requests for an interview. Her lawyers also did not respond to requests for comment.Multiple girls told Palm Beach detectives that when they arrived at Epstein’s mansion, Kellen would escort them upstairs to Epstein’s bedroom and lay out the massage table with the various oils and lotions that they were to use on him, according to police reports.In an interview, Ransome said Kellen and Maxwell also gave her tips on how to give Epstein erotic massages, including how to rub his feet and best satisfy him sexually. “It was Ghislaine and Sarah Kellen that showed me how to please Jeffrey,” Ransome said.The assistantsLesley Groff, Epstein’s executive assistant for almost 20 years, was one of the possible co-conspirators named in the 2008 plea deal Epstein’s lawyers worked out with the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida.She said in a 2005 interview with the New York Times that she answered Epstein’s telephone and managed his schedule, which included meetings with prominent scientists, Wall Street executives, foreign dignitaries and US politicians.Over the years, she said in 2005, she formed a special bond with the financier, anticipating his needs. “I know what he is thinking,” she said at the time.But Ransome said in her lawsuit that Groff, now 53, also arranged travel and lodging for the seemingly endless stream of adolescent girls and young women who provided Epstein with erotic massages.In a recent interview with the Times, Ransome said Groff communicated directly with her, repeating Epstein’s promises to help her obtain a fashion degree. Groff’s lawyer, Michael Bachner, said his client worked as part of a professional staff, making appointments, taking messages and setting up meetings.“At no time during Lesley’s employment with Epstein did she ever engage in any misconduct and never knowingly made travel arrangements for anyone under 18,” Bachner said.Ransome also alleged in her lawsuit that she was instructed by Epstein’s associates to go on a diet and to lose about 11 pounds to maintain her slim figure. In one email exchange reviewed by the Times, Ransome told Groff she was monitoring her weight for Epstein.“Please could you also let him know that I am now 57kg and that everything is going well,” Ransome emailed Groff in 2007.Another of Epstein’s assistants, Adriana Ross, was also named as a potential co-conspirator in the 2008 plea deal. When Palm Beach police were investigating Epstein around 2005, Ross removed three computers from the Florida mansion, Banasiak, the house manager, said in a deposition.The police noted in their reports that the computers, which they had reason to think might contain photos of naked girls, were missing when investigators arrived.“She show up one day with gentleman,” Banasiak said. “And she told me that they are moving out those computers.”Ross, who went on to study accounting and is based in Miami, did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment.‘The more you do, the more you make’Nadia Marcinkova, a former model and pilot, had come under police scrutiny in Palm Beach in 2005. A 16-year-old told detectives she was giving Epstein a massage when Marcinkova entered the room naked, according to Palm Beach police reports.Epstein then told the girl she could make an extra $200 if she performed oral sex on Marcinkova, and the girl reluctantly agreed, the reports said.That encounter was the first of many sexual trysts the teenager told police she was coerced into having with both Marcinkova and Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion, according to a police incident report.Police records also show that investigators had indications that Marcinkova might have been underage herself when she became involved with Epstein.Marcinkova, who later used the last name Marcinko, declined to answer questions about Epstein’s alleged abuse of girls when she was deposed in a lawsuit, invoking the Fifth Amendment.Reached by the Times, Marcinkova’s lawyers, Erica T Dubno and Aaron Mysliwiec, said “like other victims, Nadia Marcinko is and has been severely traumatised” and “needs time to process and make sense of what she has been through before she is able to speak out”.Prosecutors may face thorny legal issues in deciding whether to charge some of Epstein’s associates, like Robson and Marcinkova, who may have initially been victims themselves.Determining criminal liability is always a complex decision if a person has been exploited for sex, then used as a pawn to recruit others, said Lauren Hersh, a former sex-trafficking prosecutor in Brooklyn who now leads World Without Exploitation, an anti-trafficking organisation.“But for their own exploitation, they wouldn’t do that,” she said. “It becomes really, really tricky.”Robson, a former stripper and Olive Garden worker, was not among the four women given immunity in the Florida plea agreement. But her role in Epstein’s operation was significant enough that Palm Beach Police detectives had planned to charge her more than a decade ago, according to an affidavit by the lead detective in Palm Beach.She was also sued twice, and she described her role in Epstein’s operation in a deposition.When Epstein would fly into Florida, Robson said she would get a call on her cell phone from Kellen, who would tell her how many massages the financier needed for the upcoming visit. The two of them would hammer out logistics.“I would have a girl that would be available for those dates and times,” Robson said in a 2009 deposition. Robson told lawyers she made $200 for every high school girl she brought to the Palm Beach mansion. She recruited the girls from her high school, including one who was 14. When she brought a 23-year-old, Epstein balked. Too old, he told her.The girls knew what they were getting into, Robson said. The rules were unspoken, but understood.“The more you do, the more you make,” Robson said in the deposition. “If you were topless, if you were working in your thong, your bra, you’re going to make more than a hundred.”Reached by the Times, Robson said, “I have nothing to say. I would appreciate if I was not contacted.”Douglas McIntosh, a lawyer who represented her in a civil case in Florida, called Robson “a lovely young lady”, but declined to answer questions about her involvement with Epstein.In her deposition, Robson said that she had debated suing Epstein, but decided against it.“I just thought it was the easy way out,” she said. “And then I decided this is my life and I have to take responsibility for my own actions because I did volunteer.” – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Teenage boy left fighting for his life after stabbingCharity Commission warns over doorstep collection scams as they publish advice for pensionersRecord number of over 65s not getting the care they need, as system risks \u0026#39total collapse\u0026#39, warns Age UKBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsFarmer granted landmark restraining order after vegan hate campaign left him in fear of his lifePop band who recorded song with Greta Thunberg accused of hypocrisy by Tory MP Private school pupils doing fewer GCSEs than ever, as headteachers push them to pursue sport and musicRotherham grooming gang jailed as judge criticises \u0026#39ineffectual\u0026#39 authorities for not protecting victimsFears rise of hard border in Ireland after Brexit after old customs post is turned into construction site Comment: Delivering Brexit is the only way to end the performative rage of the RemainersHow British councils are sending recycling to Indonesia, where it is burnt on unauthorised dumpsBrexit Momentum protests to be led by hard-left Student Union activist who boycotted Remembrance Sunday, branding it \u0026#39insidious\u0026#39Prince Andrew makes defiant appearance after photograph shows him partying with Jeffrey Epstein and Donald TrumpNew York investigators reportedly zero in on Epstein recruiter as net tightens around his \u0026#39enablers\u0026#39 Police admit white powder seized during drugs bust at Gatwick airport is actually cake mix for vegan bakeryUnvaccinated university students driving rise in mumps cases, experts sayEU \u0026#39wants to extend Article 50 to avoid no deal Brexit\u0026#39 as Eurosceptics say Brussels cracking under pressureMet Commissioner says diplomatic leaks in Sir Kim Darroch case \u0026#39point to serious crime\u0026#39Boris Johnson faces battle with 17 Tory rebels to fight off legislation to thwart \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitSajid Javid and Boris Johnson in spectacular falling out over Sonia Khan sacking days before spending reviewPaul McCartney reveals one of his grandsons was mugged at knifepoint in LondonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000207437769_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxTgV-VEbjByvRp9E0Pb-y4euE8mO3loKfLBNcbArYqo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dancers take stage launch 17th series strictly come dancing","story":"Neil and Katya Jones danced together for the first time since announcing their split during the red carpet launch of Strictly Come Dancing 2019.The pair announced their separation in an official statement earlier this month after six years of marriage and 11 years together overall.At the BBC event in London, the estranged couple performed in front of a live audience, as their fellow professionals also took to the stage.Dressed in sequinned costumes, Neil and Katya were cheered on as they performed a series of impressive moves.Their split came nearly a year after Katya was pictured kissing her former dance partner Seann Walsh, although they did not cite the comedian in their reasons for the break-up.Neil Jones and Katya Jones attend the Strictly launch in London Speaking at the launch she said: It\u0027s really, really nice.

She went to Epstein’s house and gave him a massage, she said in a 2009 deposition.She then started recruiting other girls and young women to do the same, and was paid by Epstein to bring the girls to him.On Friday two sources told The New York Times that Miss Robson was among the Epstein “enablers” being looked at by prosecutors, who have said that Epstein’s death does not mean the end of the case.Sarah Kellen and Ghislaine Maxwell, pictured together in 2005 in New YorkThere has been much speculation that other Epstein associates – including British heiress Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein employees Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Adriana Ross and Nadia Marcinkova – could also be drawn into the investigation.But the paper’s report is the first time that sources within the investigation have confirmed that they are looking into the activities of any particular one of his associates.The four employees were all granted immunity under a 2007 plea deal reached in Florida. All four have denied any wrongdoing through their lawyers.Miss Robson told The New York Times that she has “nothing to say”. She added: “I would appreciate if I was not contacted.”Court documents show that Miss Robson was placed under surveillance by Florida police in 2005, when they first began investigating the accusations against Epstein.Jeffrey Epstein with Adriana Ross in May 2005. Ms Ross was granted immunity by Palm Beach authorities as part of Epstein\u0026#39s 2007 plea dealWhen questioned, aged 19, she told police: “I\u0027m like Heidi Fleiss” – the infamous Hollywood madam who recruited prostitutes for film stars. She provided police with the names and ages of all the girls she had bought to Epstein, thus implicating herself in a number of crimes.Miss Robson told police she had provided Epstein with at least six girls over a two-year period, with the youngest being 14 and the oldest a 23-year-old woman.She said that she was reprimanded by Epstein for bringing a 23-year-old to him, as he told her the woman was too old.   In the 2009 deposition, Miss Robson said she considered suing Epstein.“I just thought it was the easy way out,” she said. “And then I decided that this is my life, and I have to take responsibility for it, because I did volunteer.”Teenage boy left fighting for his life after stabbingCharity Commission warns over doorstep collection scams as they publish advice for pensionersRecord

millionClick to followThe Independent TechA tumultuous few weeks for bitcoin may be coming to an end after cryptocurrency markets experienced an exceptionally quiet day of trading.Over the last 24 hours, the price of bitcoin shifted by less than 1 per cent, as stabilising forces also saw ethereum and bitcoin cash move by a similarly fine margin.Bitcoin settled at around the $9,600 - well below the $10,000 milestone that one cryptocurrency analyst recently described as the new normal bottom\u0026nbsp- following a flash crash that saw $10 billion wiped from its overall value in the space of just 30 minutes.Despite this, many experts remained hopeful that bitcoin remains on an upward trajectory and could still go on to reach record highs before the end of the year.One investor noted on Twitter\u0026nbspthat the recent price crash did not take bitcoin off its course of setting higher monthly lows since February 2019.\u0026nbspThe price of bitcoin has trebled in price over the last seven months, though still remains a long way off its record high of close to $20,000, which it reached in December 2017.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearSimon Peters, an analyst at online trading platform eToro, explained that the recent dip may simply be as a result of a batch of bitcoin futures contracts that were set to expire.“Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures contracts are set to expire tomorrow, which historically has prompted trading activity within the cash market, he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit \u0027will see Bitcoin value hit record high\u0027It’s possible that investors are selling off now to insulate themselves from greater losses in the coming days.\u0026nbspFurthermore, this downward momentum has been exacerbated by low trading volumes over the last week, which has meant that a relatively small number of big trades have been able to move the needle sharply.”Several prominent figures within the cryptocurrency community have stood by their previous positive predictions, with cyber security pioneer John McAfee\u0026nbspcontinuing to stand by his bold bet that bitcoin will hit $500,000 in 2020.Such a claim seems modest when compared to other historic predictions. Computer scientist Hal Finney, who some believe may be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto, was perhaps the most bullish about bitcoin’s price potential.One week after the first ever genesis block of bitcoin was created in January 2009, Finney published his thoughts on what the value of bitcoin would be if it went on to replace the US dollar as the main global currency.“Imagine that bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world,” he wrote.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe report also explained how the as yet unnamed digital currency could be used to support and improve China’s already expansive surveillance network.\u0026nbsp“The PBOC aims to improve the effectiveness of its monetary policy, while mapping out a more comprehensive picture of all iniduals and businesses across China,” the report noted.“Unlike privacy coins, central authorities would be able to gather information. Eventually, identities would likely be tied to respective inidual wallets, hence making it fully non-anonymous, unlike bitcoin.”For it to work on any significant scale, the new currency’s payment infrastructure will need to be able to process and handle a huge volume of transactions. The report suggests this would be somewhere in the region of 300,000 transactions per second, though currently no blockchains\u0026nbspare capable of supporting such a high volume.The cryptocurrency\u0026nbspwould also presumably require users to own smartphones, even if they don’t have bank accounts. Current estimates suggest that only around half of China’s 1.4 billion\u0026nbspinhabitants own smartphones.Like Facebook’s Libra, China’s new cryptocurrency is designed to bring key financial services to those without bank accounts.Bitcoin ‘inventor’ ordered to pay billionsThe PBOC\u0026nbspfirst started researching the potential of a new cryptocurrency in 2014, however according to Binance’s report, the development of the cryptocurrency was fast-tracked after Facebook first announced its plans for Libra earlier this year.“Digital currencies are coming into the mainstream and international competition is heating up. Economies risk being disadvantaged if they are left behind,” Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“China’s\u0026nbspnew currency could even rival Facbook’s notorious proposed cryptocurrency, Libra. This is largely because Facebook is not permitted in China, giving the government a potential monopoly over the market.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It included the words by innovation only and included all of the details about the event.But it was the image lurking behind the text that might offer the real clue about what\u0027s to come.The image is notably colourful: far more brightly coloured than Apple\u0027s usual invitation. It suggests, at the very least, that something particularly vibrant is on its way.But it might be a reference to something more specific. Apple had already been rumoured to be potentially including a colourful Apple logo on the back of the phone, in an apparent reference to its old rainbow logo.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

That could further suggest that Apple is aiming for a nostalgic look in the new devices.Apple confirms when it will release new iPhoneThe different hues might also be a reference to the colours of the phones themselves. With the iPhone XR last year, Apple launched the new devices in a variety of different colours – and many of those colours are present in the image.There is, at the moment, no green iPhone. But, by coincidence, that colour has also been rumoured as the new one in Apple\u0027s upcoming line-up.Apple\u0027s event invitations are always picked through for clues about what is to come. Usually, they don\u0027t offer anything concrete – but can give an important indication of the kind of theme that Apple is aiming for in the new products or the event more generally.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine how many people dont complain. To me its unreal.If I got out of the car and it was my own fault and then fair enough. Then I wouldnt be complaining.I feel wronged and thats why Im speaking out.Terry Tunniclfe, , recieved a £ fine in the mail after dropping a pal off at the petrol station.Mum Louise Stevens, from Littleover in Derbyshire, accused EMA of daylight robbery after she copped a £ parking fine.Couple Sharon and Geoffrey Palmer, both , were slapped with a £ fine as they were filling at the petrol station.Nigel Martinez, , was given a £ fine after he said he stopped for  seconds to check his tyres pressure - which was later cancelled.Mum Ruth Pickering, , slammed airport officials after she was fined £ for collecting her daughter while she was filling her car with petrol.Gordon Jackson, , stopped at the petrol station to buya newspaper before he was handed a £ fine, thereported.Pizza shop worker Tajdar Kamal has called for the petrol station to be shut down after saying he got a £ fine in the mail, Derbyshire Live reported.An East Midlands spokesperson said: “Controlling traffic flow on the roads throughout the airport is key to ensuring people’s safety and enjoyment of visiting East Midlands Airport.Vehicles waiting in undesignated parking areas when dropping off and collecting passengers not only causes congestion, but is dangerous for both drivers and pedestrians.Parking or waiting on roads across the airport estate is prohibited.This is clearly sign-posted and all roads are red-routed and enforced by a third party organisation.The same compliance company has a separate agreement in place with the petrol station owners.“All drivers dropping off and collecting passengers at EMA should use the designated car parks and drop-off facilities.One hour’s free parking can be had in Long Stay , which is ideal for drivers collecting passengers, ten minutes parking in rapid drop off costs £, while  minutes in short stay  car park is £.”A representative for Vehicle Control Services Limited said: We wish to make clear that the private access roads to East Midlands Airport and the area of private land occupied by the Fuel Station are covered by separate contractual arrangements.The introduction of enforcement measures was introduced as a result of the constant and growing abuse of the roadways land which was causing unnecessary congestion as well as creating safety risks to road users, including emergency services, and pedestrians.Our CCTV footage clearly shows that Mr Smiths vehicle had stopped on one of the no stopping roadways at East Midlands Airport his vehicle was stationary at the start and throughout the CCTV surveillance.There is an abundance ofhigh visibility signs at the entrance to, and at regular intervals throughout, the roadways warning drivers that No Stopping is permitted these also contain the recognised Clearway symbol.Furthermore, the roadways are painted with double red lines. In stopping where he did, Mr Smith would have driven past more than  of the warning signs.There is no evidence to support Mr Smiths allegations that he sought advise from one of our Patrol Officers and, in any event, our Patrol Officers would not advise motorists to stop in a No Stopping roadway.A short while after, Mr Smith was observed stopping his vehicle at the Fuel Station beyond the area occupied by the pumps, at which point  people carrying hand baggage approached the vehicle from the exit area of the Fuel Station and got into the vehicle.We are satisfied that the Parking Charges were correctly issued for breaching the advertised terms and conditions on the  distinct areas of private land."},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane dorian florida live path map","story":"The Category  could develop into a Category  storm, potentially threatening cataclysmic winds of more than  mph.Hurricane Dorian is currently gathering pace as it crosses the warm Atlantic and is expected to bring mph winds when it makes landfall in the US.Forecasters predict the currently-mph Category  hurricane will strengthen to a catastrophic Category  when it hits the mainland.The increasingly menacing-looking storm system will draw energy from the warm open waters as it closes in, forecasters say.The National Hurricane Centre said the Category  storm is expected to strengthen into Category  with winds of  mph.University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy warned: If it makes landfall as a Category  or  hurricane, thats a big deal.Tropical Storm Dorian is the fth in s Atlantic hurricane season.A tropical storm is a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms.Depending on its location and strength, a tropical storm is referred to as a hurricane, typhoon, cyclone or simply a tropical storm.By the middle of the week, Tropical Storm Dorian is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, when the winds go over mph.Its heading towards Florida where a state of emergency has been declared.Disney World and other attractions are in the path.The big cruise lines, operating out of Miami, have begun rerouting their ships.Jessica Armesto and her one-year-old daughter, Mila, had planned to have breakfast with Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy at Disney World.But instead, the mum decided to take shelter at her mothers hurricane-resistant house in Miami with its kitchen full of nonperishable foods.She said: It felt like it was better to be safe than sorry, so we cancelled our plans.The storm gained media attention towards the beginning of this week when it was east-southeast of Barbados and heading towards the Caribbean.The UK foreign office has warned those travelling to Florida.A statement says: A state of emergency has been declared in Florida.The US National Hurricane Center predicts Dorian reaching Category  Hurricane strength before weakening. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the US National Hurricane Centre and follow instructions issued by the local authorities, including any evacuation orders."},{"url":null,"title":"remainers porkie pies trade deals","story":"By drawing his excited opponents into making accusations about yet more of Boris’s “porky pies”, he has skilfully drawn attention to the point he really wanted to make — that there are huge global opportunities for British food exportersonly we are prepared to make concessions in opening up our own food markets to the world.In fact,we start exporting pork pies to the Far East we will only be ing to what we were doing more than  years ago.In , Melton Mowbray bakers Evans  Hill reported they had received a large order of pork pies from Borneo — which is even further from Britain than Thailand.If we could do it then, without modern refrigeration, we can surely do it now. As Boris was arguing, the real barriers to trade are not practical ones — they are taxes and regulations.Remainers continually lecture us on the benefits of free trade with the EU — and they are right to do so. Hardly anyone really wants to leave without a deal. If we do have to take that route it will surely not be long before discussions on a free trade deal recommence.Yet those same Remainers bizarrely retreat in horror when anyone suggests we do a free trade deal with the US. “But we’ll have to eat chlorinated chicken,” they complain, as well as GM “Frankenstein” food.As shown by their failure yesterday to agree on a common course of action to thwart Brexit, Remainers are bumbling along in a state of confusion.But nothing demonstrates this better than their contradictory approach to free trade. They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Thanks to the Remain lobby’s endless infighting and self-indulgent argument over who it would like as a caretaker Prime Minister, that is exactly what is overwhelmingly likely to happen on October . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s with us the people – and that’s why we need to take action.Our message to Johnson is this:you steal our democracy, well shut down the streets.But Tories reacted with fury to Momentums ludicrous plan.David TC Davies told The Sun: Momentum seem to think that no one should do anything without their permission - and theyre going to block the streetsthey dont get their way.And its ironic that they are complaining about Parliament being shut down while they are stopping anyone from getting there at all.Another MP added: “They appear to be trying to ‘Stop the Coup’ as they put it by launching one of their own.”A former Labour MP – Tom Blenkinsop – tweeted that Momentum was “playing into the hands of the right” with their fury.It comes after thousands of people turned up to protest outside Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament last night.Spontaneous protests are being planned in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield too.Earlier today Mr Rees-Mogg urged teeth-gnashing Remainers to change the law or boot the Government out -they can.The Commons leader led the Government fightback today against pro-EU MPs who have vowed to stop Boris Johnson shutting down Parliament next month.Mr Rees-Mogg told them to bring it on - and that the Government was ready.He told the BBC this morning: All these people who are wailing and gnashing of teeth know that there are two ways of doing what they want to do.One, is to change the government and the other is to change the law. If they do either of those, that will then have an effect.If they dont have either the courage or the gumption to do either of those then we will leave on the st of October in accordance with the referendum result.And he added: No party should be afraid of the British people.If they have a vote of confidence, lets seethey can win it.He said the outrage over shutting down Parliament was phoney and blasted Speaker Bercow for his insistent.The teasing came as he said that Mr Corbyn doesnt have enough mates to win such a vote.Nobody wants him to be PM, he joked, labelling those who are trying to thwart Brexit as spewing out phoney outrage because they want to stop us from leaving.They are trying very hard to overturn the referendum result, he blasted.Labours Barry Gardiner confirmed to Sky News today that Labour would apply for an emergency debate next week, and would seek to force Boris to get another Brexit extension.Yesterday Boris asked the Queen for her approval to suspend proceedings for nearly five weeks from as early as September  - and she accepted.Under the extraordinary move, the PM will be able to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday, September  and no later than Thursday, September ."},{"url":null,"title":"miss england finalist samantha bumford bgt stalker","story":"Jonathan Deal, , bombarded the -year-old woman with messages, telling her that she was beautul as he became more and more obsessed with her.And he even broke past security and tried to kiss her on stage - telling her she only did well because the judges thought you were my girlfriend.The wannabe rapper, who vowed to dedicate a Britains Got Talent audition song to her, was caged after following her to events across the UK.Deal was released from prison in May but was jailed again for  weeks in July for breaching a restraining order by re-posting messages on Facebook relating to the Miss Dorset and Miss England contests Samantha had participated in.But speaking to the BBC, Samantha revealed that she felt physically sick at the thought of he will be walking the streets again in October.The beauty queen, who was crowned Miss Poole  and Miss Dorset , said: Im terried, I feel physically sick at the thought of him coming out and being out on the streets again.He breached once - whats to say he wont breach again.MOST READ IN NEWS \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   pmCOMPOSITEshane.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveHORNY WARNEY Shane Warne has -way romp with lover and  sex workers that woke neighbours \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   maggots-emerging.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" WarningFEELING RUFF  Stomach-churning moment dozens of live MAGGOTS are squeezed out of dog by vet \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HOTEL PANIC Dads fury after cops storm hotel room when he checked-in with daughter,  \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-comp-mcbrawl.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" SENT FRY-ING Woman tosses bloke around ‘like a rag doll’ in viral McDonald’s fight video \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   VP-COMP-PADDY.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" RICHES TO RAGS Paddy Doherty lives off £-a-week from sons and admits speeding in Merc \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   SM-COMP-RANSOM.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HELD TO RANSOM Brit couple stuck in US with £k hospital bill after baby arrives on hols She said she had broken down in court when she heard he had a shocking rap sheet of  similar previous offences.Samantha said: What I want is for the system to go - OK this has happened before, we now need to take this to the Crown Court and this needs to be dealt with very, very seriously.Deals  past offences relate to other harassment and stalking incidents dating back to  - and Samantha fears more women could be targeted by the rapper when hes released.Samantha said: I dont feel safe when Deals out of prison... he could come out, go off the radar and try to hurt me - or worse, kill me.

From day one they took over.The couple had been wanting to renovate their home before selling up to move closer to their son in Anglesey in Wales.But after going away on holidays for just four days they were stunned to find their home in horric condition.They said they found five bottles of vodka in the kitchen bin with a mixture of mouldy food and packaging - and the fridge had been emptied and restocked with Polish food.Delia added: Then my husband went into the bedroom and he started talking to someone.I thought he was going mad, but there were people in the house. Obviously we told them to get out straight away.The place was a tip. These two labourers, who we think might have been homeless, were living here and they didnt realise we would be back.The worst thing is they had been sleeping in our bed. They had used the food out the fridge and cupboard.We found cooked food in all the pots and pans and some was stored in the fridge. It was everywhere, even in the garden.If thats how they live in our house, imagine what they must live like it their own. They just had no respect for the place. I couldnt believe the audacity of them.The two men had even watched pay-per-view items on our Sky subscription. They had disconnected the gas so we had no hot water or heating.But they had managed to find two electric heaters and our blankets and had really made themselves at home.We knew they had been sleeping on our bed as the pillows were everywhere and the TV was on a dferent channel to the one we had left it on.Delia and Mick, a Carlsberg factory worker, kicked the building firm off the site halfway through the job, having already paid them some £,.But the work they had done was substandard too. The brickwork was not level and a gap had appeared in the join between their neighbours home.The new wall did not meet the roof and two independent builders assessed the work as being poor. The driveway was left cracked where ready mix concrete had been delivered.A whole new drive and garden path is now needed and carpets had to be ripped up because workers trampled cement into them with their boots.And while the couple tried to get another company in, they were again faced with substandard work.It means Delia and Mick are currently in limbo and having to obtain a third quote from a building contractor to fix the work done.Delia said: Weve had independent people come out and tell us the whole thing needs tearing down and doing again. But we havent got another £, to spend.The former director of the company said he was deeply sorry for the way workers treated the Cunninghams home.He claimed that the two men were not sleeping or staying at the house to his knowledge and said he was forced to hire cheap labour and cheap parts to do the job within the budget.I have closed the business now and taking my le in another direction.The company has since been reported to Trading Standards."},{"url":null,"title":"babestation model slashed face seats","story":"Zoe Lewis, , was on a night out at Flints Bar, Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham when the yob hurled a prosecco glass at her.There was a minor argument over seating in the smoking area before the woman launched a brutal attack, the stunner said.Glamour model Zoe said she was left in shock and suffered a three-inch cut after the bank holiday assault on Sunday, August .She said adult TV channel Babestation has told her to take two weeks off work until her scar heals.Zoe told Birmingham Live: One of the girls looked at me and said, excuse me can you just move up please But I couldnt hear properly, I moved my arms to point and said: No sorry because my friend was sat here, so hell have nowhere to sit when he comes back.Another girl appeared from nowhere, and she sat down on the two girls lap.As I stood up she just launched the glass of prosecco off my head, out of nowhere, she threw it off my head.Ive never been in a fight before, I thought she slapped me, so I didnt know shed actually scarred me.

Well, now it’s his turn to squirm.I have no idea of his exact involvement with the hideous pervert Jeffrey Epstein during their “friendship”, but this week one of Epstein’s alleged victims claimed she had sex with Andrew three times. Virginia Roberts, photographed being embraced by the prince when she was a teenager, claimed he “knows exactly what he has done” and should “come clean” about it.The waters are being muddied with claims by “friends” of Andrew the photo is fake. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing but this story is not going to go away and people are demanding answers.Epstein hanged himself in his New York jail cell this month while on sex-trafficking charges — and sparked conspiracy theories galore.Andrew claims he knew nothing about Epstein’s disgusting lestyle, but it is baffling that he continued to associate with him even after Epstein’s conviction in  for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender.Why on Earth would anyone continue to hang out with such an unsavoury character, especially , like Andrew, you are a dad with two daughters of your own  At the very least this scandal shows that Andrew has appalling judgment when it comes to his pals and associates.He has previous when it comes to cosying up to the rich and dubious.

That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement.

This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws.

They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.There will undoubtedly be protests over this decision. Boris Johnson will be accused of purging the Tory party of those opposed to No Deal. But the tactics are not dissimilar to those used by John Major to get the Maastricht Treaty through in  in the face of opposition from his party’s Eurosceptics.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OAPs at an Age UK day centre told the Mirror about the vital leline a television offers many of the . million over s across the UK as the Prime Minister prepares to clobber them by breaking a manesto pledge.Labour ’s deputy leader Tom Watson met with concerned pensioners at the Onneley Centre in Birmingham todayand threw down the gauntlet to Mr Johnson.He said: “People think he is a liar anyway, he has lied about his private le and he has lied about policy.    “There is an easy thing for him to do to rebuild some trust. “That is why I am challenging him to honour Labour’s pledge to back the free TV licence for the letime of not just this Parliament, but the next one as well whenever it comes.” In  the Conservatives promised in their manesto to maintain free TV licences. But the BBC was handed responsibility for funding the benefit from June , under a deal stitched up in . Mr Johnson told the Mirror earlier this week the BBC should “cough up”. Just . million OAPs who receive Pension Credit are likely to continue receiving the benefit - but , people entitled to the support last year didn’t claim it. More than , veterans are part of the .million pensioners set to be stripped of their free TV licences from next June. Speaking to the Labour’s deputy leader, veteran Mick Horton, , who served for  years with the Second Batallion Royal Fusiliers, pointed out that the extra £. a year they will have to pay will send many now OAPs into the red.    He said: “This is going to do a lot of harm to pensioners and veterans in particular. “People are proud and they don’t want to be seen asking for help, and it’ll mean money problems for lots of people I know. “My neighbour is  and lives alone - the sound of her TV is how you know she is okay and going about her day. “The Tories have come for our TV licences, and they’ve raised my we’s retirement age, what is next  “Is the winter fuel allowance safe  We can’t trust promises that it is anymore.” Another former squaddie Bob ‘Knobby’ Clarke, , who served for  years in the Armyand only left the Reserves aged , said that for many ex-serviceman the TV is a chance for some company and support in dficult times after a le spent serving their county. “I visit my former Sergeant Major he’ll speak about his family, but the other thing that keeps him talking is TV - speaking about what he has seen. “It gives people a chance to recall memories of their le - and some company.    “For people with dementia or Alzheimer’s it helps them keep the time - they knowGood Morning Britain is on they should have their lunch andthe News at Ten is over then it is time for bed.“It makes me furious to think of Boris Johnson taking that away from people who’ve worked their whole lives.”Ex-Army cook Jim Tennant, , branded the PM’s decision not to keep his promise “mean and dishonest”. “If he would listen to me I would tell him to keep his promise - becausehe doesn’t a lot of people will never vote for him or his party again,” he said. Carol Goult, , said that for her -year-old father who died earlier this month the TV was a friend that allowed him to explore the world when ill health confined him to just four walls. She said: “He loved Blue Planet and the Discovery channel. “For him television kept his mind active, it meant he never had to give up his love for learning. If pensioners have to choose between feeding themselves or paying the TV licence they lose so much, Boris Johnson should come here and talk to people about what he is taking from them.” Alan Powell, , an ex-street furniture fabricator from West Bromwich, said laid out what for most is the biggest injustice.    “I worked my whole le in a dirty job which is now affecting my health. “For so many, the TV makes all the dference - and that extra expense is going to mean that so many pensioners aren’t going to be able to live out the end of their lives how they would have wanted.” Last night a government spokesperson said: “We are very disappointed with the BBC’s decision. We expected them to continue free TV licences for the over-s. “Taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to make sure it delivers for UK audiences, which includes showing restraint on salaries.” More than , have The Mirror’s campaign for the Tories to reverse this decision.

The Duke of York has ed to work today, visiting Dartmouth Yacht Club, of which he is patron, during the Dartmouth Regatta this afternoon. Dressed in a suit and tie, the Queenaposs third child looked relaxed as he smiled broadly and spoke to friends during the event. Andrew ed from his sunny break with ex-we Sarah Ferguson on Wednesday for crisis talks about how to deal with increased scrutiny over his relationship with paedophile Epstein and Virginia Roberts. Roberts claims she was forced to sleep with the Duke when she was just  and was famously photographed with him in . He has denied any form of sexual contact of relationship with Ms Roberts. A US judge threw out her allegations deeming them to be immaterial and impertinent and stuck them from the record in court. Speaking outside a court hearing in New York yesterday, she said: He knows what he’s done. I hope he comes clean about it.  A royal source told the Sun: “Andrew and Fergie flew back together on Wednesday. He knows he has to come back and face the music. “The optics were not a good look, with so many stories about the Epstein accusers while he was on a sunny golf course in Spain. He’s having a series of talks with advisers this week about how to salvage his reputation going forward. Epstein killed himself in jail this month while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges.  This morning the Daily Mirror exclusively published photos of Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein and Donald and Melania Trump which were taken in December . The never-before seen photo sheds further light on the Duke of York’s then friendship with disgraced financier.  It also shows the global scale of the widening scandal that now embroils a number of the world’s most powerful and wealthy men. Prince Andrew’s presence will also increase intrigue as he continues to reel from sex abuse allegations revealed in court documents.  Earlier this week a number of women who say Epstein sexually abused spoke in a packed courtroom in New York. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, conducted a two and half hour hearing and let the women testy despite the fact that Epsteinaposs death meant he would never face a trial. Among them was British actress Anouska de Georgiou, , who went to the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge. Miss de Georgiou said: “When I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of a teenager. Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and abused me. “He cannot begin to fathom what he did to us. Although I think it is tragic when anyone died before their time, I am extremely relieved he will not be able to hurt any more children.”  Miss de Georgiou had a role in the Jude Law film “Alfie” in , before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her Hollywood dream. This week a number of Andrewaposs friends defended him against the accusations.

The Duke of York, who has snubbed calls to reveal what he knew about the depraved financier, was snapped smiling yesterday at the exclusive Dartmouth Regatta in Devon.But the storm over his friendship with Epstein, who died in custody last month, looks set to deepen as US lawyers have now threatened legal action to force him to testy under oath.And the man who took the photos of Andrew at Mr Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in  – which was revealed in a Mirror world exclusive on Friday – told how Andrew’s presence created a “buzz” the likes of which had never been seen before.   Palm Beach-based Daryl Davidoff, , and his late father Bob were Mr Trump’s personal photographers for over a decade. He said: “Trump had hosted the richest, most powerful men and women in Palm Beach. But to have a royal, the Queen’s son, at Mar-a-Lago was another level. “There was a huge buzz. I attended loads of events but I definitely remembered that one because I got to photograph a royal.” Our image showed Andrew at the Florida party with Epstein, the tycoon’s then-lover Ghislaine Maxwell and Mr Trump and then-girlfriend Melania. But Epstein is staring creepily in the background while everyone  laughs and chats. Daryl said the billionaire’s appearance was one of only a handful events he ever saw him at. He said: “Epstein wasn’t a big deal then, nor was Ghislaine. I knew who they were but it wasn’t like everyone was excited to see them. He wasn’t a player in town.    “Jeffrey was pretty low-key. He didn’t fit into the old-money, wealthy Palm Beach types. Mar-a-Lago wasn’t his thing. He kept to himself, which considering what was apparently going on now makes perfect sense. I had no idea he was into young girls. “On the night in question, Andrew was perfectly happy to be photographed. But Epstein was glaring in the background, which you can see in the image, which I thought was odd. “Andrew was pretty low-key, especially when you compare him to the usual loud, rich Palm Beachers.” Daryl also claimed Mr Trump regularly invited “pretty” workers from nearby clubs to his seafront complex. He said: “He’d get them from the t*tty bars. They were stunning women, all adults, who Trump liked to surround himself with at Mar-a-Lago. “Epstein never seemed that interested, which with hindsight was probably because they were too old for him.”    Andrew was the guest of honour at the Saturday night gala, hosted by the future President as part of a tennis event to raise cash for a cancer charity. Other guests included singer Michael Bolton and actor Stephen Baldwin. The bash came just months before Epstein began abusing schoolgirl Virginia Roberts. She started working at the club as a changing room assistant in  and has claimed Maxwell approached her about giving massages to rich men. She claimed Epstein later lent her out to prominent figures, including Andrew. Roberts claimed to have had sex with the Prince on three occasions, in London, Palm Beach and the US Virgin Islands – which he denies. The FBI has seized a photo showing the Duke with Roberts in , aged . Sources suggested it was doctored and said aides asked to see the original. But it emerged FBI agents took the snap from her, along with  others, in . Roberts, now known as Giuffre, was in a New York court earlier this week with other alleged Epstein victims and said of Andrew: “He knows what he’s done. I hope he comes clean about it.” David Boies, chair of a New York law firm, said “there is too much evidence” linking the royal to Epstein and he is “continuing to delay and obfuscate”.    Mr Boies said he has asked to interview the Prince and is willing to travel here – butthis does not happen, he would consider a lawsuit to pressure Andrew to give evidence under oath. Andrew entertained Epstein and his pals at palaces when they were in the UK and enjoyed private visits with him in New York, London and on his private Caribbean island. The Duke embarrassed Buckingham Palace when he was snapped walking in New York’s Central Park with Epstein in , after his jail release. And recently, footage from a day later has emerged, showing the Prince at Epstein’s nine-storey Manhattan home – known as the House of Horrors. Roberts has alleged the Duke groped her during a visit to the £million pile – which Epstein filled with bizarre decor, including prosthetic breasts in the wall by his bath. A source from Epstein’s parties claims Andrew was a “draw”, saying: “Jeffrey knew what he was doing. Royalty is stardust. People held their noses after he was convicted but were not going to turn down the chance to mingle with royalty.” Epstein’s pilot has also claimed Andrew flew on the fiend’s personal jet, dubbed the Lolita Express, and some flights were made with Roberts. Maxwell was allegedly Epstein’s “madam” and Roberts said on oath in a  court case that she “recruited” her for sex aged .    Selby Patrick, whose twin sister Skye was an alleged victim and died in , has claimed: “It was Ghislaine who recruited Skye’s friends into his world. One wanted to be a model and Ghislaine made her believe they’d launch her to stardom. It was the girl who took Skye to Epstein’s house. “The le was hard to resist. Skye said Ghislaine was so sophisticated. But she was lowering them into the trap.” Most of Epstein’s victims were from the Palm Beach and West Palm Beach area of Florida, where he had a mansion. Earlier this month, it emerged three more women had filed lawsuits against the pervert’s estate. One claims he forcibly used a sex toy on her and another that he took her passport, stranding her on his island. Andrew, , and Maxwell, , the daughter of the late, disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, both strenuously deny any wrongdoing. A US judge previously threw out Roberts’ allegations against the Duke as “immaterial and impertinent”.

They sit cross legged and open mouthed in front of him as the former Jefferson County police officer tells them how to escape an active shooter. It is a once upon a time story with a chilling twist. If a killer invades their US school they must hide under their desks or evacuate and follow in their teacheraposs footsteps, holding hands as they go.    Another lesson is about the aposturtle peekaposapos a way to checka gunman is walking down their Kindergarten corridors. Joe Deedon, , from TAC*ONE Consulting who provide Active Shooter Training last week took his team of five, all former police, to Pinnacle Charter School in Colorado. “Itaposs kind of sad and for most people a real eye opener to see how much these children know” he told the Mirror. “It is age appropriate for the little children we start the sessions with questions and answers, askingthey know why we do lockdowns. Some of the parents are there too. “They are just four and they were replying: aposIn case a bad person appearsapos. “They are so sharp, some even know the proper words for it, answering:aposaposIn case someone tries to shoot usapos and aposin case an active shooter comes in hereapos.” Joe, who himself attended two school shootings during his police career, explained: “We teach them to spread out away from the doors and use little hand signals. We donapost want them to run into danger.”    But he says the lessons for the older pupils at Pinnacle are a bit more hardcore. They are taught not just how to run and hide but how to fight back as well. It follows the mass shooting in Colorado at the STEM School Highlands Ranch in May, when one student died and eight were wounded. Two shooters went into the school carrying handguns and other weapons hidden in guitar cases before opening fire. One schoolboy was killed when he was shot in the chest as he lunged at the gunman. The second shooter was pounced on by several others. It was the latest of many school shootings plaguing the country which has seen  this year. Joe said: “Itaposs just being realistic, the students have been the missing link for  years. “Kids can be a very good asset and the training is changing. “We are not advocating being a hero but sometimes when in a deadly situation to fight is the only option.” Last week the High school students were also given lessons on guns, in case the shooter has a a mal or gives them chance to escape as he reloads.    They were taught to evacuate using aposanglesapos - police techniques to make sure their path is safe. But most of all they were told how to immobilise a shooter by practising on a heavily padded mock gunman armed with a yellow water pistol. They joined forces to bring him to the ground, pinning his arms and legs down until police arrive. Giovanni Medina Rico, a senior, said he didnapost think it was odd to learn SWAT tactics in school. “We all have a job now,” he said. “We all have to take care of each other.” Chad Miller, CEO of Pinnacle Charter School said: “Obviously, active shooters are a real thing now and theyaposre part of our society Itaposs time to bring the kids in. “Our job as a school is to educate our kids but we can’t do thatthey’re not safe. “So we’re empowering our kids and teaching them the safety that they need to learn sosomething would ever to happen they know how to react…whether it’s in our school or outside of school. “Some of these Junior High kids are as big as I am. They can help in these situations.”    Clarissa Burklund, present of Pinnacleaposs school board, said they decided to go above their normal traditional lockdown drills after the STEM shooting “I hate that they have to talk about this,” she said. “I hate that they live in his society. But they do, and thereaposs no point in denying it.” Mr Miller added: “As we saw in the Stem shooting the kids got involved so now itaposs time we have to train these kids, we have to give them the skills and the tools and the empowerment.” Teachers at the school had earlier been given training on how to deal with an armed gunman. In America there is no nationwide rule on how schools prepare their students for active shooters. But many have been taking extreme measures, using simulated gunfire and pretend gunmen. In December last year a simulated shooting caused panic in Florida as hundreds fled after it was announced over the school intercom: “This is a Code Red. This is not a drill.” Some pupils vomited, others had asthma attacks and one fainted as they locked classrooms and shoved tables in front of doors.    Students were sent by teachers to hide in the closets or told to hide under desks before it emerged it was fake. Joe Deedon, owner of Tac-One Consulting, said students need to learn they have a “wheel of options”. He is convinced the training is le-saving and says in the Valentineaposs Day , Parkland shooting in Florida, more youngsters could have escaped with training. “There were a group of eight who waited three-and-a half minutes to get shot when  ft behind them was an escape door which would have taken them to safety,” he explained. Three of the eight teenagers died, two were wounded and only three escaped. In total  were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.    “We tell the kids about this and you hear them shout aposwowapos those kids would have lived with a fraction of the training weaposve had today. “The teenagers tell us they feel like sitting ducks and this training stops them feeling helpless. If gives them a plan.” “They donapost have to passively hide and wait for the shooter to find them,” he added.    Some of the deadliest school shootings in US history August st,  – University of Texas tower shooting.  victims. A -year-old engineering student, Charles Whitman, got into the observation deck and killed  people and wounded  during a -minute shooting rampage.  April th,  – Columbine High School in Colorado.  victims.

Louis Borrill and his fiancee, Yeridiana Chazares, had been visiting her family in Baltimore for a surprise baby shower but after she woke up the following day with what seemed to be a strong fever, they decided to go to hospital. Baby Lily Borrill was born the following morning - well ahead of the November due date and weighing just lb, oz - and may not be discharged from hospital for three or four months, meaning the family cannotto their home in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire until then. This will lead to expensive hospital and hotel bills, as the couple did not have medical insurance. Grimsby Live says sum this will exceed £,.    Louis said: With Yeri being six months pregnant, we decided to play it safe and go to the hospital. We were then informed that Yeri wasnapost experiencing a fever - she was in pre-term labour! After hours of scans, doctors said Yeri would not be able to leave the hospital. Louis said: Obviously, we were shocked by this, we planned to have Lily in Scunthorpe and then we find out that weaposre going to have to have her born here, and in the back of our minds realising what was going to come. Although in pre-term labour, the doctors told Louis and Yeri that this waiting period could have been anywhere between a few hours to a few months, with them having to remain in the hospital throughout.    However, at .am on August , baby Lily was born. Louis said: I donapost even know how I could possibly describe that -hour period. We were scrambling around trying to figure out what we had to do and were both obviously very nervous. But we knew we had to remain calm, knowing our baby could come at any point. Our beautul Lily decided she had enough of waiting around and came to us two days after her baby shower and three months earlier than we expected. When Lily was born she was not moving and could not breathe.    After  minutes, a doctor managed to put in a breathing tube - saving her le. Since then, Lily has been breathing but has had some rough days. She stopped breathing twice and had to be resuscitated last week after having a heart murmur, which it was hoped medication could treat. Due to being so premature, Lily also still has a vessel called a Patent ductus arteriosus , which babies lose when they are born. She is set to be reviewed by a cardiologist who will determineshe will need further surgeries after being checked.    Yeri spoke about the pain of seeing her first-born child having to be put in an incubator and continuing to be monitored by doctors and specialist surgeons. She said: Having contractions and a c-section doesnapost compare to the pain I felt seeing my first-born in an incubator covered in tubes and tinier than I could have ever imagined. All day I blamed myself, thinking thatmaybe I had done something dferently Lily would have made it to full term.  The doctors say Lily is doing great breathing, moving and, hopefully, getting stronger and stronger. I canapost wait to have her home. The couple said doctors had told them that Lily would not be out of the woods until around three or four months and only then can she be discharged and they canhome to Scunthorpe. Louis said: We did not have medical insurance as it was around £, because Yeri was pregnant, just for those ten days. The risk of not paying for this backfired.

Brandon Webbaposs parents were twice told to say their goodbyes while he was on le support after taking the illicit drug at Electric Picnic . The -year-old is urging festival goers to be careful at the same festival this weekend, reports the Irish Mirror. Brandon, a one time contestant on Irelandaposs Got Talent, was enjoying his festival experience with friends when, after a few drinks, decided to take some MDMA - with disastrous results. Speaking just days after festival organisers announced a massive clampdown on drugs, Brandon said: “I was just drinking, it was the Sunday of the festival.    I’d never done any drug before but as I drank more I let my guard down. I took MDMA and it all went downhill from there. I suffered a minor stroke and was rushed to Naas Hospital. My mam got a call that morning at am and rushed over - she thought it was a joke at first. Before the festival she would always say ‘If you ever take something you’ll be the one that something happens to’ and unfortunately something happened to me.  I had over  seizures in an hour and ended up on le support, they put me into an induced coma on the Monday morning and told my mum and dad to say their goodbyes. I woke up on the Tuesday and had a seizure straight away so they put me back under again. For the second time they told my parents to say their goodbyes. I woke up the following Friday and the seizures had stopped. I was released from the hospital two weeks later. Giving a message to festival goers, Brandon warned: This weekend last year changed my le forever. I made a mistake and instantly regretted it, what I put my mum, my dad, my little brother and sister and my whole family through was terrible. Be careful and say no, you don’t want to go through what I did. And stay safe - my advice would be beware who you’re with and who you’re around and who your so called friends are. A friend doesn’t try and push drugs on to you. I’ll never tell anyone not to do it because I’ve done it myself butyou are don’t be stupid, have your wits about you and make sure you’re with people you trust.    Electric Picnic organisers have decided to enforce a major clampdown on drugs this year following a spate of deaths at festivals over the summer. Promoters have warned that everyone attending the three-day event will be searched for illegal substances. The zero-tolerance stance comes after two young men lost their lives recently in Ireland. There were a further three drug-related deaths at festivals in the UK over the summer. Speaking at the Stradbally Hall site earlier this week, Festival boss Melvin Benn said: We will work closely with the Garda. The searching will be rigorous. But it’s about people making their own choices. Drugs are illegal for a specic reason – principally because they are dangerous. What’s in the drugs people don’t know and we urge people not to take drugs. That’s what the Electric Picnic position is and we hope they don’t. The deaths that have taken place in the UK were caused by excessive alcohol and drugs but we urge people to be aware that drugs are unsafe and not to take them.

We left and then this giant eruption happened! A couple of smaller eruptions now and this metallic taste in our mouths. Waiting to seewe need to help with evacuations. Tourists gathered to watch ash billow into the sky and lava gush down the slopes of the unpredictable volcano after a huge roar was heard and felt for miles around.Some tourists were very scared as they watched the explosion from a square in front of a church near the base of the volcano, and anxious residents are now fearing a third major eruption of the summer, La Repubblica  reported.There were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings.    The summit of Stromboli - one of the most active volcanoes in the world - had already been closed due to an increase in activity, including smaller explosions this week. The volcano is on the small island of Stromboli in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the north coast of Sicily.  Gianluca Giuffre, who lives in the village of Ginostra on the south-west side of the island, said residents had been anticipating another major eruption given the increase in activity. He told La Repubblica: We were expecting this explosion, even though we didnapost know the exact day.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has ditched her contraceptive pills and has bravely decided to bare herself to the world. Like many teenagers, Bianca Jantscher suffered from acne. When she started dating her first boyfriend at the age of  doctors prescribed her a contraceptive pill, which signicantly improved the clearness of her skin. It wasnapost until a decade later in October  that Bianca realised that the medication was causing her to endure mood swings and anxious spells. The -year-old stopped taking the pill and, as she expected, started to suffer from acne again a few months later. When natural remedies and little tricks - like covering her face in manuka honey, changing her pillow cases daily and not touching her spots - didnapost work, Biance ed to her doctors and asked for dferent medication.    This had little effect however, leading the office clerk to make the brave decision to bare herself to the world.Bianca started her Instagram page and has been proudly sharing pictures of her acne to encourage other women to love themselves for who they are.When the acne broke out and I was struggling with pain, I was overwhelmed with the situation, the Graz, Austria woman said. I wanted to hide and stop the time. I wondered why it just struck me when I have always eaten healthy food, I donapost drink alcohol and I never smoked. I began to compare myself to others and of course it took some time for me to accept this condition and leave those negative and wrong thoughts behind me. Bianca had a breakthrough when she realised that she had to take responsibility for herself and her own body.    She continued: I believe that listening to your own body is always the right way. After the first shock, when my acne started, I quickly realised that hiding isnapost an option.I wanted to share my journey on Instagram although I still donapost know where this will take me.I never expected to get so much positive feedback and tips and to get to know people with similar experiences. Having had long term anxiety about her skin, Bianca was happy to be met with a wall of positivity online. It was in real le that she was stung by peoples comments. On Instagram, I havenapost received a single negative message and in real le there were two statements, which I guess, I will remember forever, she said.    The first time I went to see a doctor, I mentioned that Iaposm trying to not wear makeup, and he assured me that makeup could hardly worsen the already catastrophic situation. At that time, his words hit, because at the beginning of my acne I was struggling to accept my situation anyway. The second memorable moment was when a colleague told me that she is also planning to drop the pill and that she really hopes not to look like me in the end. Of course, I know that no one wants acne, but this statement was like a slap in my face. I think that many people forget what a psychological burden a skin disease like this brings and the strength it requires to not give up and show your face every day to the world. Some people were surprised that Biancaaposs acne ed after she stopped taking the pill but her friends and family have been supportive of her.    Having tried clay and manuka honey face masks, Bianca is now focusing on healing her skin from the inside out through nutrition and drinking lots of herbal teas and lemon water. Hardly anyone believed that my skin was actually getting worse by stopping the pill, she added. Many could not even identy it as acne and could not believe or even understand my stories. In an attempt to reduce the acne Bianca has cut out a great deal from her diet, including gluten, dairy products, sugar, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, aposnightshadeapos foods like tomatoes, corn and sunflower oil, vinegar and sour fruit. She also has a total ban on heavily processed food or fast food. Any photo showing my acne in full splendour is worth postingit encourages a young girl to love herself as God created her, Bianca continued.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that.

Jordon Forster has played in plenty Edinburgh derbies, Jamie Ness has played in Old Firm derbies, Gowserin loads of Dundee derbies, so have Cammy Kerr and Kane Hemmings.“It does help but it is still what you do on the night. Those derbies they’ve played in the past have no real impact but you hope they can go in and not be shocked.”And the Dee manager is looking forward to reacquainting himself with the Dundee derby tradition that sees the away team walk the short distance between the two grounds.It’s something he believes is a great reflection on both sets of fans and the city.“I came from going into Tynecastleand it was a police escort or whatever, then came up here and got told we just walk down,” he said.“I was thinking surely we can’t walk down but it was great.“I thought at the start it was a wind-up.

This derby is about the football and that’s what I like about it.“There are no side issues to it, which is good for the city and it’s a credit to both sets of supporters that it is that way.”For those not familiar with this fixture, he does stress the friendly atmosphere does not stretch into the game itself.“I hate using the word but the fans hate each other for the  minutes,” he said.“And, like any derby, the players are desperate to win for their fans, for their team.“It becomes a real derby for the game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street derby fever builds but tough tests for city clubs first","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Tom Duthie, George Cran and Calum Woodger look ahead to next week#s much-anticipated Dundee derby but not before Dundee host Inverness and United travel to Dunfermline.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"ardbeg bullock winner at islay cattle sale","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual show and sale of autumn-born suckled calves at Islay Auction Mart on Friday August .A good show of calves was presented to show judge J Taylor, Easter Octhtermuthil.Winners were: Bullock class:  Ardbeg,  Kilchiaran,  Ardbeg Heer class:  and  Ardbeg Champion calf: Ardbeg bullock which takes the William A Low Trophy Reserve champion: Kilchiaran bullock.Overall, the bullocks sold to an average of £ per head or .p per kilo while the heers levelled out at £ per head or p per kilo.Principal lots and prices: Bullocks: AAx: £ and £– Ballimartin.

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-sisters-debuting-edinburgh-festival-fringe","story":"Elaine and Katrina Hunter will stage a plethora of musical styles at their new show lsquoStar Inspirationsrsquo at Greenside @ Infirmary Street,  Infirmary Street, Forest Theatre, Venue , from this Monday to next Saturday .They will be joined by other cast members from Elainersquos Leith-based singing and performance coaching studio Vox Stars to celebrate aspiring singers.The sisters, who were born and bred in the Honest Toun at Newhailes, where they still live, come from a long line of fisherfolk.Their great grandmother Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Millar was known as the last creel-carrying fishwe in Scotland and went on to be awarded a British Empire Medal.Elaine, , whose stage name is Lainey Vox, said: ldquoWe grew up on the same street as our great grandmother and she encouraged our performing arts ventures, clapping and waving her hankie to our living room performances on top of her wee box.ldquoShe also loved nothing more than a chat about handbags and fashion over their Friday night fish dinners.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"poll-support-eu-holding-new-indyref-rises","story":"A survey of how people feel on Brexit found that only  per cent favour the decision to quit the European Union, while almost % now say they are against the plan.This compares to the % in Scotland who voted to leave in the  referendum, compared to  % who wished to remain.Furthermore, the ongoing threat of crashing out without a withdrawal deal and the doom-laden prophecies of disruption at ports, empty supermarket shelves and civil disruption means that more than one-in-ten Scots said they are now \"terried\" by the prospect.The survey, filled in by  Herald readers asked them to list their biggest concerns over plans to leave the EU, with a No Deal Brexit being ranked top by almost half of those who responded.:Johnson may have made independence completely inevitable says Nicola SturgeonOther their concerns were that Brexit would bring threats to the economy and jobs, disruption to NHS supplies are treatment, and boost the far right in Britain.Almost % were worried that it might lead to Scotland leaving the UK, although % are worried that the current impasse at Westminster may lead to Brexit being cancelled.The survey, predominantly filled in by those in the -and-over age group, was taken last Thursday before Prime Minister Boris Johnsons plan to suspend Parliament was revealed.Among reasons given for being concerned about Brexit, one said: \"Becoming a vassal state to Donald Trumps America\", while another was worried about the UK turning inward, saying: \"My children are half-Finnish and I fear for the rise in racist attitudes and othering that is being legitimised in the UK.\"The Leave campaign was criticised, with one respondent saying they were concerned about: \"The legitimising of hate crime, racism and \"English exceptionalism\" that has accompanied the Leave campaign and its aftermath\" along with \"The invoking of jingoistic notions that should have died years ago and the demonising of our closest allies.\":Scottish Tories hiding in their bunker after Johnson moves to suspend Commons#Another added: \"I worry that the UK in general and Scotland in particular risk being more separate from European countries and more isolated economically, culturally and socially.

In addition to its Glasgow HQ, IES has offices in Dublin, Atlanta and Singapore, and representatives around the world, particularly in Australia, Europe and the Middle East.ldquoOur clients are major multi-disciplinary design firms around the world, along with universities, councils, corporations and city authorities. We do compliance work in a number of countries and we have a strong focus on optimising the design and operation of any building project. The tools enable lsquowhat rsquo scenarios to be tested at the design stage, and throughout the operational le cycle of the development, she explains.IESrsquos software can import metered data eg BMS, and AMR sensor data to model the dynamics of operation of a building or system which is a characteristic of a true digital twin.A virtual lsquotwinrsquo will test-run scenarios to identy optimal investments and improvements.As Graham explains, large buildings typically generate huge amounts of data from air conditioning, sensors and utility meters. The sheer volume of data makes it dficult for estate managers to make effective interventions. The ability to visualise all of the data on a single  uncovers unknown issues and opportunities for improvement.ldquoModelling the building management data in real time in a buildingrsquos D digital twin enables us to get an in-depth understanding of how the building is performing and what can be done to improve its performance, as we can virtually test dferent options. Clients are interested in how they can achieve zero carbon targets quickly and cost effectively.ldquoThe leaders of a university, or the management team at a hospital are faced with having to evaluate dferent potential solutions. Our software helps them model solutions, such as installing wind turbines, modying buildings, or incorporating energy storage, she notes.IES has helped organisations around the world to solve these kinds of queries. Another good example is a recent project at Dundalk Institute of Technology in Ireland where a team of students and researchers worked with support from IES. They factored in the cost of three options against their carbon targets to understand how best to invest. Graham also points to the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, which has become the first ICL Living Lab, creating a full D model of the campus. This helps them to ensure that the buildings are all operating optimally and allows them to test Energy Conservation Measures already installed to decide how to achieve further savings.ldquoWhere we are dealing with a lot of building sensor data we use AI and machine learning to help to process that information, we can simply the view the management team get and customise it to what they want, thus reducing the burden on those iniduals. With the Internet of Things there will be more and more data available so itrsquos important we have robust means of capturing and processing that data and using the insights to inform decisions or drive the building systems. Think of the Hive control for home heating systems but on a much larger scale.Another recent example is the work IES has done on Orkney. ldquoA number of Scottish islands are off the grid and the communities see a benefit in being self-sufficient as far as electricity generation is concerned, Graham explains.The ICL tools can be used to model the energy demands and generation, at the same time, create a portal for the community to engage with the data. An example of this is Nottingham Trent Basin ndash a major residential development project. The project runs a PVarray with the largest storage battery in Europe. IES has created a model which residents can interact with via apps on phones or via a -inch screen on site. Researchers from Nottingham Trent University are involved in demonstrating the benefits of making the data accessible in order to mody behaviours to reduce electricity use.The way people behave inside a building or a cluster of buildings, has a major influence on emissions, she points out. ldquoWhen you know how a building is performing you can start incentivising iniduals to move towards a more responsible use of energy. This can have a really positive impact in the drive towards decarbonsation, she notes.With the Scottish Government having set a ldquonet zero-carbon target for Scotland to achieve by , the software clearly has a valuable role to play in helping local authorities and cities to get to grips with their emissions.ldquoCreating a virtual, digital twin of a campus, or even of a city, is a powerful way of understanding the dynamics and identying opportunities. To quote Lord Kelvin lsquoIf we donrsquot measure it we canrsquot improve itrsquo. Using the ICL any stakeholder can gain an understanding of the impact they and the built environment is having on the environment, Graham notes."},{"url":null,"title":"judge-dismisses-bid-halt-parliament-suspension-plans","story":"A group of  parliamentarians were seeking an interim interdict - similar to an injunction - at the Court of Session ahead of a full hearing.:Outcome of legal challenges to Parliament suspension to be revealed\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs HmvlMKk-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests HmvlMKk.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This aimed at halting prorogation until a final decision has been made on the case.But on Friday, Judge Lord Doherty dismissed the motionahead of a full hearing next week.:Civil disobedience and strikes threatened in mass Brexit protestsMr Johnson announced earlier this week that Parliament was being suspended for five weeks from mid September.Lord Doherty said he was ldquonot satisfied that it has been demonstrated that therersquos a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage.He said a substantive hearing was already set to place on Friday September  ldquobefore the first possible date parliament could be prorogued.But he brought that hearing forward to Tuesday September  ldquoin the interest of justice.Aiden OrsquoNeill QC, representing those for the action, had argued for the substantive hearing to be moved forward.He said: ldquoThere is an urgency to this ndash any delay is prejudicial ndash not just to the prejudice of the petitioners, but to the country as a whole.Lord Doherty said: ldquoIrsquom going to move the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday.ldquoWeighing consideration in the balance, itrsquos in the interest of justice that it proceeds sooner rather than later.The decision came after the Queen approved Mr Johnsonrsquos request for Parliament to be suspended for five weeks.On Thursday, the judge heard arguments from a lawyer for the campaigners ndash led by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and aided by Jo Maugham of the Good Law Project ndash and from a legal representative for the UK Government.Mr OrsquoNeill QC urged the court to step in and stop the suspension of Parliament, arguing it would prevent an ldquoabusive and ldquounconstitutional use of government powers.However, Roddy Dunlop QC, representing the UK Government, called on the judge to reject the request, as the Queen has already prorogued Parliament and there is ldquono reason to have an interim decision on such an important matter.Responding to Lord Dohertyrsquos decision on Friday, a government spokesperson said: ldquoAs we have set out, the government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda and MPs are not prevented from scrutinising our withdrawal from the EU.ldquoWe are glad the court found against the interdict ndash there was no good reason to seek one, given the full hearing is due to take place next week, and the process of bringing the session to an end will not start until the week commencing September ."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-tay-bridge-dundee-rep-neil-cooper-four-stars","story":"Tay BridgeDundee RepNeil CooperFour starsSTRANGERS on a train are destined for disaster in Peter Arnottrsquos new play, which marks this Decemberrsquos forthcoming th anniversary of the  Tay Bridge tragedy.

Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Driven by my interest in social and environmental justice, I have been pleased to secure a number of concessions and legislative changes to improve the lives of people in the region.“At this time, I’m focused on working with others to secure the passage of my Member’s Bill giving children equal protection from assault and hope to see it become law in the near future.“The Climate Emergency our planet is facing means that, more than ever, Green policies are required.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I have never seen it as bad.”My source was not exaggerating, but I could not believe the extent of it. The ScotRail Journeycheck website even advised passengers to “make their own travel arrangements” because of overcrowding between Edinburgh’s main station and Haymarket. That was simply extraordinary.The industry staffer who texted me painted an alarming picture that was repeated in many messages, photos and videos posted by passengers on social media into the night. “Cancelled trains lots” came the next text from my source. “Hundreds of passengers not able to get on services, police at almost every train for crowd control...no management in attendance...I can’t keep up with the disruption.”But even with Edinburgh Festival crowds and a Scotland v France rugby match at Murrayfield, how could this have happened  ScotRail is highly experienced at dealing with crowds from big events and, with new trains, it’s never had so many carriages on main lines from the capital such as to Glasgow and Dunblane.We await the findings of ScotRail’s internal inquiry, but it appears that a “perfect storm” of circumstances contributed to what appears to have resulted in near chaos, according to its definition as “complete disorder and confusion”.ScotRail operations director David Simpson said: “A number of unexpected incidents caused signicant issues on the network, with a trespassing incident and a train fault adding to a handful of cancellations following some late call offs.”Trains are understood to have been halted on a secondary Edinburgh-Glasgow line at Curriehill in western Edinburgh, and a train on the main line between the cities was stopped for  minutes at Linlithgow after a passenger activated an alarm because of the crush on board and the driver was unable to release the brakes.I have been told that two drivers’ shts had also not been covered and last-minute replacements had to be found, although ScotRail has not made clear whether this caused any further cancellations.On the basis of what we know so far and what I have been told from within the rail industry, two conclusions can be drawn.First, Saturday’s events demonstrate once again that the railways are a sitting duck, prone to disruption from a wide range of causes over which they have no control. This can be anything from people straying onto tracks, as happened, to others, all too often, taking their own lives. Trees on adjoining land can blow down, damaging overhead power lines. Even fires in nearby garages have stopped services because of explosion dangers.Trains can’t steer round obstacles like on the roads, and there are often no ersion routes.But secondly, I hear that despite ScotRail’s new trains and recruiting more staff, it still has limited resilience when situations escalate.While many of its new electric fleet has arrived, most of the refurbished diesel trains for long distance inter-city routes have yet to go into service because of problems with upgrading work by other firms. There are also still not enough additional drivers yet trained.A further factor is that despite all the disruption, ScotRail is still seeing underlying passenger growth.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sdlps eastwood calls on mps to vote down tory government","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We should all work towards getting a consensus on a withdrawal agreement. If anything, it is the backstop which provides the greatest threat to the Belfast Agreement.\"Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said the move illustrates the \"arrogance\" and \"contempt\" of the Conservatives.She added: \"Todays move demonstrates clear intent to force through a no-deal Brexit, regardless of the consequences for Ireland, north or south.\"It shows the arrogance of the British Government and their contempt even for their own political institutions and it is very clear that Irish interests will never be protected at Westminster. \"The Tories have shown a total and callous disregard for our country and the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the north to remain in the EU.\"Sinn Fein will continue to stand up for our interests against Tory Brexiteers and their catastrophic Brexit agenda.\"Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said it meant a no-deal Brexit is now the most likely outcome and that Irish interests were not being protected.But DUP MLA Gordon Lyons hit out at Sinn Feins criticism, citing the more than two-year Stormont impasse. He said: \"Sinn Fein have a cheek to complain about the prorogation of Parliament, meaning that it will be sitting for four fewer days than would otherwise have been the case, when they have been responsible for the Assembly being closed for the last two and a half years.\"Mr Eastwood, meanwhile, slammed Mr Johnson for acting like \"a tin-pot dictator\", describing the move as \"disgraceful\" and \"anti-democratic\".\"Proroguing your parliament to enforce the will of a government that has no democratic legitimacy for an act that has no majority support is the behaviour of a tin-pot dictator,\" he said.And in his letter to MPs last night, he wrote: \"It is now clear that Boris Johnson does not understand the fragile complexities that underpin peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. More worrying, however, he clearly doesnt care. \"As the leader of a party that played a signicant role in forging the Good Friday Agreement through dficult but courageous compromise, I am appealing to you to help protect the progress we have made.\"In these circumstances, I would urge you to back a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson as Prime Minister.\"The British Governments actions undermine its role as a guarantor of peace and stability in Northern Ireland. It should not, therefore, command the confidence of MPs.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long called the suspension of Parliament a \"cowardly and outrageous\" move, which \"follows in the footsteps of other dictators\".\"This is more akin to something seen in an authoritarian state,\" she said.\"We have been told Brexit was about taking back control. However, parliamentary democracy is being undermined and sacriced on the altar of Brexit, which puts us in extremely dangerous territory.\"It is the desperate act of a Prime Minister who knows Parliament opposes a no-deal but who will attempt to push it through regardless.\"It is utterly appalling the DUP are giving cover to this Parliamentary coup, when they know full well the severe effects a reckless no-deal will have on Northern Ireland.\"TUV leader Jim Allister welcomed Mr Johnsons move, saying it is \"time to get on with getting out\". He added: \"Three years on, the patience of the people has been exhausted.\"Todays news would appear to bring us closer to implementing the will of the people. Assuming it plays out like that, today will be remembered as a good day for democracy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"amber rudd northern ireland businesses and workers have every right to feel optimistic about future","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In particular with Youth Action Northern Ireland, who work with , young people every year, helping them to build future careers in areas like performing arts, business and technology.As the Work and Pensions Secretary Im responsible for overseeing the welfare reforms that are helping more people get into work, with Universal Credit offering every jobseeker a personal work coach and the tailored support they need to overcome whatever barriers they face.Following the Fresh Start Agreement, Universal Credit was introduced here as well in the last few years.On my visit I met with officials from the Department for Communities working to make sure people here experience a smooth transition to the new system, benefiting from its flexibility and simplicity.Its right that issues like welfare reform, which have such a big impact on the people of Northern Ireland, are decided on by their representatives here in Stormont.So like the rest of the Government, I also urge the political parties in Northern Ireland to work quickly to restore devolved government at Stormont. The people of Northern Ireland need to have confidence that decisions are being made by local politicians who represent them.Businesses certainly have confidence in Northern Ireland workers. In the last four years alone over , more people have been employed by private companies here. As weve created a more favourable business environment across the UK, easing regulation and lowering corporation tax, weve seen private enterprise flourish. There are , businesses based in Northern Ireland, almost , more than there were in . Yesterday I also met some of the  entrepreneurs creating new businesses here in Belfast with the help of Catalyst - a charity offering mentoring support and office space to new start-ups.Based at Belfasts historic docks near the Game of Thrones studios, it is a prime example of how Northern Irelands former industrial centre is becoming a new economic powerhouse for arts and technology.Im also encouraged by public signs from Harland  Wolffs administrators looking for a new buyer for the company.As the Northern Ireland Secretary has said, while its a commercial process, the Government will do all it can to support a successful bid. Jobseekers in Northern Ireland should be optimistic about their future.Wages are rising faster than the UK average and workers here earn an average of £ a week more than they did five years ago. Employment is booming.Game of Thrones has ended, and like many fans I was sad to say goodbye to Westeros. But with the worlds most popular TV programme creating a legacy for its arts and entertainment industry, with its new wave of entrepreneurs and with near full-employment, Im confident that optimism is well founded."},{"url":null,"title":"eu ready for more brexit talks but uk needs new backstop plan simon coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"head of irelands haulage organisation calls for calm heads ahead of brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I understand residents’ concerns, but I do believewe believe in the value of human le we have to value all lives, we can’t pick and choose who is ill and who isn’t.”More than  supervised injection sites operate globally, mainly in Europe, Canada and Australia. A  study of  sites in North America found that injection rooms fulfilled their harm-reduction objectives, and were not found to increase drug use or crime.Upon the rejection from Dublin City Council, there was considerable public outcry, with accusations of a “not in my backyard” mentality from those who objected.The Minister said the answer to community objection is education on the issue.“This is in my back yard I’m glad to say, there will always people who will have concerns, the most important thing is to give people as much information as possible,” she added.“The people using the rooms would probably live in the area, and it’s about not having to see newspapers in the morning telling us that someone was found dead in a laneway.“At the moment, people are openly injecting, it will take them off the streets and take them into a medically supervised facility, where they can access supports and out of the public eye.“I wouldn’t want my children passing people injecting, with needles and other paraphernalia lying around.“My issue with Dubin City Council is they’re not seeing the bigger picture, and how this will enhance the community.“This is a le and death matter.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis said that the settlement “was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens”.Sir Jonathan remains as the NIO’s permanent secretary, its most senior official.A month ago the News Letter revealed that all images of the Queen – even one of her shaking hands with Martin McGuinness – were then banned from the walls of Stormont House. NIO minister Lord Duncan said at the time that the department “takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House”.Reacting to widespread criticism of the move, new Secretary of State Julian Smith then tweeted a small image of the Queen on the mantel piece of his private office within the building, but the NIO declined to say whether it had only been placed there in response to criticism of the initial decision.Mr Smith ordered a civil service review of the initial decisions. Despite having begun at the height of the holiday season, that review has now been completed in an unusually brisk time frame for the slow-turning wheels of bureaucracy.The News Letter understands that a photo of the Queen on her own has been placed in the main entrance corridor of Stormont House - the first place where guests go when visiting the property - along with another image of the Queen with Irish President Michael D Higgins and an image of Prince Charles in a church with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh.The images are part of a wider series of photos, one of which is of commemorations at the Ulster Tower for the fallen at the Somme. Officials believe the images as a whole represent a balanced range.A source close to Secretary of State Julian Smith said: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.” pictured outside the High Court in Belfast where he was seeking an emergency injunction stopping Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament.

At the time of Lord Maginnis’s remarks, all that the NIO would say was: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”The NIO said: “A portrait of the Queen – our head of state – is on display in the public area of Stormont House alongside a balanced set of images celebrating and reflecting the work of the Northern Ireland Office.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

Short Brothers files in dollars, while KN Networks Ltd and Lakeland Dairies Ltd files in euros. To allow for fair comparison their financial results have been amended to reflect the currency value at their financial year-end. .

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
