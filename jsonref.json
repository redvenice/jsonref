Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

From Damien Hirst’s sword-fighter to a cat called Hodge, our critic picks his top 10The ship, which sank in 1912 with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid’s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it’s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland’s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh’s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine for others, he’s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won’t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over – weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets – but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin’s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man – a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain’s most famous war leader.This statue by\u0026nbspsculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn’t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in\u0026nbspthe Talking Statues project, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.\u0026nbspThis fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You’ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they’re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious\u0026nbsptouch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn’t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing’s signs to share her message.They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don’t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature.You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument – soaring over leafy trees and green water – is still one of Britain’s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.\u0026nbspThis compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin’s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history’s crimes and speak for all victims.\u0026nbspThere’s no danger of Damien Hirst’s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone’s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn’t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6581b54dd7881463079915a2e00bf34a99b4272/2127_1278_4527_2716/master/4527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6883e54ebcfbb6ef89eb865d2f5fbc9","title":"schoolchildren on lockdown in leeds in pictures","story":"It’s not the same for every family during the Covid-19 crisis.

Some have been displayed at the firm’s Waterside headquarters near Heathrow, but many of the 1,500 artworks in the collection have been on the walls of its executive lounges.However, with some analysts believing that the lucrative business travel market may never return to pre-crisis levels, lounges are likely to have more austere decor in future.According to the Evening Standard, Sotheby’s has valued a number of works held by BA for a potential imminent sale, with one piece by Bridget Riley – described by some as a masterpiece – likely to leave BA’s Heathrow executive lounge and raise millions for the embattled airline.The move comes as the majority of BA’s fleet remains grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic, with all of the aviation industry facing an uncertain future.Álex Cruz, the airliner’s chief executive, had promised to “take every possible action to conserve cash” when BA notified unions it was planning redundancies. The minimum consultation period for up to 12,000 redundancies passes on 15 June, potentially allowing the airline to start shedding staff, although BA has said it does not expect to do so on that date.British Airways did not comment on the art selloff, but a source said the airline was not ruling anything out to save money and jobs, and the idea is believed to have been taken up by management after asking staff where to find savings.IAG, its owning group, recently said it was burning through cash at a rate of €30m (£26.7m) a day. Plans to restore many flights in July are currently under review while IAG attempts to overturn the government’s quarantine rules, introduced on Monday.​BA said: “We are acting now to protect as many jobs as possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.”The Unite union, one of three representing BA workers, has disputed the need for mass redundancies. Len McCluskey, the general secretary, said: “The company is claiming to be in financial difficulties while\u0026nbspBA’s Spanish parent company IAG is still planning to spend close to €1bn to buy another airline, Air Europa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1162640dbf07fe3dae50899cdaa18e0073647c57/0_213_6396_3838/master/6396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=502e28ef9a5724ae69b31a4a4badddee","title":"recession uk britain coronavirus developing world oecd","story":"First coronavirus, now the OECD says Britain will top the developing world’s recession league table.

But stations are being killed off to save moneyDriving into Nottingham a few years ago, I remember seeing posters for new “local” radio shows hosted by Myleene Klass\u0026nbspand the tall one from JLS. It was a strange scene that has likely been replicated across the country, where once genuinely local output is replaced by a celebrity presenter sitting in a central London studio.In recent years, the idiosyncrasies and charm of regional shows have quietly been replaced by a cheaper, identikit radio. In 2019,\u0026nbspGlobal Radio\u0026nbspreplaced the 40-plus local breakfast shows across its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three nationwide programmes hosted from London.\u0026nbspThe formula was simple enough: replace\u0026nbsplocal hosts\u0026nbspwith big names based in the capital and beam one blanket service out to the regions.\u0026nbspNow the commercial group Bauer has announced plans to fold almost 50 regional radio outlets into a national network.\u0026nbspIt means dozens more\u0026nbsptowns and cities across England will lose their own distinctive local radio stations later this year, with\u0026nbspstations such as York’s Minster FM and the West Midlands’ Signal 107 being replaced with\u0026nbsplargely syndicated programmes made in London, hundreds of miles from the communities they serve.\u0026nbspIt has also recently emerged that the BBC is considering axing its regional current affairs television shows.\u0026nbspThe award-winning Inside Out series of investigative programmes\u0026nbsphas already had its autumn series cancelled – and budget cuts mean\u0026nbspbosses have launched a review of all regional programming in England.\u0026nbspMPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, have criticised the move\u0026nbspbut offered no promise of a reprieve.\u0026nbspIf this is the end of regional output, it is going out with a whimper.\u0026nbspThe death of local radio in the UK has been a quiet type of decline.\u0026nbspWhile the closure of local newspapers in recent years has rightly gained at least some attention, the morphing of regional radio into a centralised London hub has happened with little fuss.The world can seem like it’s moved on from local broadcasting. Local radio or regional reporting can bring up less than favourable references to Alan Partridge, and the cost-cutting of commercial vehicles can easily be written off as a sad but inevitable sign of the times. Britons increasingly listen to the radio via DAB radio and smart speakers we are more used to Amazon Echo now than FM radio.\u0026nbspLike so much of the media, there is dwindling revenue in radio and ever growing competition as podcasts and playlists become the norm. Meanwhile, the 247 global news cycle is available on our phones at the press of a button.But there is still demand for regional programming, and considerable value to it.\u0026nbspRadio generally\u0026nbsphas come into its own during the coronavirus pandemic, providing structure and togetherness for listeners, and even\u0026nbspcompany for those who are alone.\u0026nbspLocal stations have been particularly well suited for this, bringing a sense of community through the airwaves. In recent weeks, my local BBC station’s Saturday night show has had its presenter broadcasting from his kitchen table. Listeners are familiar enough to text in with niche local jokes, like signing off as “Lincolnshire Mountain Rescue” (in a notoriously flat county) the host can refer to nearby bands and music venues in a way no national hub can.\u0026nbspLocal broadcasting is also a rare and vital vehicle for the media outside the south.\u0026nbspThe BBC regional current affairs television shows\u0026nbspnow under threat have\u0026nbspbeen a training ground over the years for many journalists based outside London. My first television job, on Sunday Politics East Midlands, was on my local BBC service. With no contacts at the bigger stations and being unfamiliar with the capital, local news was an invaluable way to get a foot in the door. Taking away one of the few platforms available outside the capital will only enshrine the hold of a southern, non-disabled, white, middle-class media.\u0026nbspIn an ever busier and more\u0026nbspdisconnected\u0026nbspculture, there is something unique and personal about local media output. Hearing a regional accent on the airwaves, you are transported to\u0026nbspyour own corner of the world, rooted in the people and places that are meaningful to you. It is a sense of identity, a voice that would otherwise be drowned out. As we look afresh at what it means to be home, local broadcasting suddenly feels all the more needed. We will surely miss it when it’s gone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a0a40a80056b840c12eecf9293cb68a623f8d34/0_371_8160_4898/master/8160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7060cd2b55f93feb44a71d7a3f3b53e","title":"rewriting history historians statue past","story":"People have always reinterpreted and re-evaluated the past. Every time a statue comes down, we learn a little morePeople are suddenly very concerned about the perils of rewriting history. We must be vigilant, apparently, to the possibility that great swaths of the past will be forgotten or, worse, “erased”. We must remain alert to the risk that our history will be “whitewashed” – as if there were enough whitewash in the world – with the difficult, complex bits disappeared. Meanwhile, unaware of all the controversy he has caused, Edward Colston’s statue lies peacefully at the bottom of Bristol harbour.Historians are not too worried at the threat posed by “rewriting history”. This is because rewriting history is our occupation, our professional endeavour. We are constantly engaged in a process of re-evaluating the past and reinterpreting stories that we thought we knew. Despite what Leopold von Ranke – one of the pioneers of modern historical research – said, history is not only about finding out “how it actually happened”, but also about how we think about the past and our relationship to it. The past may be dead but history is alive, and it is constructed in the present.The other important thing to hold on to in this debate is that statues do not do a particularly effective job of documenting the past or educating people about it. Much has been written recently about British “imperial nostalgia”, and the idea that as a nation we yearn for the empire that, for many of us, ended before we were born. But this country’s relationship to its imperial history is built more on erasure and forgetting than on remembering – it is a series of silences from the past. The number of monuments to men who enslaved other humans or who killed hundreds of unarmed civilians or who performed other horrific crimes in the service of empire, or the woman who presided over them, stands in contrast to the number of critically engaged conversations we have about empire’s crimes. Every time a statue comes down, we learn a little more.Some people would have it that the British are just too polite to talk about the dark side of imperialism. But it isn’t shame about the past that prevents us from having these conversations. For the British to be ashamed of their imperial history, they would have to know about it, and to understand both the worst excesses of imperial violence and the simple daily injustice of imperial rule.But many British people don’t know about this, and mostly they don’t care to find out. Instead, as a nation, we exonerate the actions of people in the past by claiming that it was simply a different time, with different values, forgetting that many brave people at the time protested against these atrocities, and resisted, and worked tirelessly so that they might be uncovered or condemned.The outcry about the removal of the statue shows that some people in Britain are uncomfortable with any critique of Britain’s past. But they want it both ways: to be free of guilt for historical sins, but to be proud of what they see as historical achievements. The most obvious example of this is the way that the British are comfortable talking about the slave trade only through Britain’s much-lauded part in ending the slave trade. But the men whose statues are being pulled down were not abolitionists but enslavers: owning up to their crimes is much more difficult for many British people than simply walking past them in the street. And for other British people, having to see these statues every day, sitting in lecture theatres and concert halls named after these men, is a daily act of violence that has become unbearable.\u0026nbspMany of these statues, and concert halls, and lecture theatres, were built and named either in the late Victorian period, or in the dying days of empire in the middle of the 20th century. This isn’t a coincidence. Empire was continually constructed as a political and cultural project at home both while the colonies and their populations were being subjugated overseas and when those colonies fought back and took their independence. Empire did not just “happen” to the British – the empire was not gained in a fit of absence of mind – and imperialism was a cultural project as much as a political, military or economic endeavour, one that had to be constantly rejuvenated. These statues do not provide a neutral narration of this country’s history, they are political monuments to anxieties about Britain’s status at the times that they were erected.The claim that removing the statue is “whitewashing” history is a pretence that these statues were somehow part of a nuanced conversation about Britain’s imperial past. But they weren’t, not least because we have statues to slave owners, but no statue to the victims of the slave trade or other victims of imperial violence. Since 2007, there has been a Museum of Slavery in Liverpool, but there is no Museum of Empire – although our museums are full of plundered treasures from Britain’s former imperial possessions – and there is no national memorial to the victims of the slave trade. If you want to talk about whitewashing history, perhaps start here.As our ideas about the world change, it is natural that so too does our attitude to the heroes and victories that our ancestors chose to commemorate. When those heroes were anything but heroic, leaving their statues standing is an insult to the modern values we claim to hold. This isn’t a sinister erasure of history: this is re-evaluating our history based on new evidence and ideas. This is historiography. And if the criticism is that bringing down Colston means we might have to pull down some more statues, then sure: bring it on. This historian approves.• Charlotte Lydia Riley is a historian of contemporary Britain at the University of Southampton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cc1e87177a4cc3781a8ad3eb6b530a5239522ad/33_2_1554_933/master/1554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=285660884c452c0c1fce4e146cd47424","title":"stephen colbert america black lives matter","story":"Late-night hosts discuss the popularity of the protests for Black Lives Matter, the unpopularity of Trump and calls to ‘defund the police’After three weeks of protests, “now it’s time to put our money where our mouth is…just as soon as we take the slave owners off the money”, said Colbert, who noted that the moment of economic and social turmoil offered America a “tremendous opportunity, but to do what?” There’s incremental reform, such as a bill introduced by House Democrats to ban police chokeholds. And there’s more radical reform, such as the popular call to “defund the police”, meaning to ert funding poured into police departments to other community resources such as mental health services, social services and education.\u0026nbsp“Right now, because those other services have been under-funded for years, all of that eventually falls to the police,” Colbert explained. “And that’s way too many things for them to be doing. It’s like in the Middle Ages: it wasn’t a good idea that your barber was also your dentist and your surgeon. And saying ‘defund the barber’ doesn’t mean no one’s getting haircuts —– although admittedly right now, no one’s getting haircuts.”While Trump contemplated, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke up, delivering a moving virtual eulogy for George Floyd at a memorial service in Houston on Tuesday. “You see, President Trump? It’s possible to bring people to tears at church without having to release pepper spray,” Colbert said. “And the Vice-President did the one thing that the President fears the most: Biden didn’t mention the name Donald Trump once. Let’s hope very soon, we can all do the same.”On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah parsed the differences between the response by congressional Democrats and Republicans to the Black Lives Matter protests across the nation. Earlier this week, Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi kneeled in honor of George Floyd wearing kente cloths, an indigenous Ghanaian fabric. “I understand the symbolic gesture of kneeling to remember George Floyd. What I don’t understand is needing to dress like extras from Coming to America 2,” said Noah, adding the gesture “felt like they were trying too hard”.“I’m not saying that all cops are bad. But the problems with the police are much more widespread than Trump is acknowledging,” he continued. “Because every single time – every single time – a police department gets audited, or investigated, the results that come back time and time again show deep rot and systemic issues often from the top. It’s like turning on a black light in a hotel room – there’s no way you’re only going to find one stain.”And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel responded to reports that Trump has dismissed polls placing him behind Biden as false. “If you think he won’t contest the election if he loses – he won’t even accept the meaningless poll he’s losing,” Kimmel said. “They’re going to have to drag him out of that White House by his heels.”“It makes sense that Trump doesn’t get it. He’s like a lot of soft-brained 73-year-old men who watch nothing but Fox News,” Kimmel continued, cutting to Tucker Carlson arguing on Fox News that America is not a racist country. “Right, but didn’t you want to build a wall to keep those immigrants out of … oh, nevermind. He’s right! America’s fine, we have no problems at all,” Kimmel deadpanned. “Those people marching in the streets? They’re just getting exercise.”Kimmel also touched on Trump’s propagation of a conspiracy theory that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man in serious condition with a skull fracture after Buffalo police shoved him to the ground during a protest last week, is an Antifa covert agent. “Just to recap, the theory here is that a 75-year-old man was using his cell phone to scan police communication equipment in order to black it out,” Kimmel explained. “I think anyone who’s tried to Zoom with their grandparents knows there’s no possible way that’s true. But our president? It takes a special kind of monster to see a peaceful 75-year-old man shoved to the ground by police so hard he bleeds from the ears and take the side of the concrete, but he does – our un-Founding Father.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18fd609aae988e476a65612c97fb0ac3204379f/0_351_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e57941bd78d4565c295dc7e3653240ad","title":"chris packham the virus has taught us that we are part of nature not above it","story":"The naturalist has always spoken his mind – and attracted death threats in the process. But Covid-19 has given him a new perspective on how humans can live in harmony with the natural world ‘I’m tramping through damp, long grass in the wake of two poodles,” Chris Packham tells me, over the phone, at nine in the morning, from his home near Southampton. “One of the joys of the UK is this rich, verdant colour at this time of year, so green that it’s almost blinding.” The naturalist’s voice, compelling and contemplative, draws you in and slows you down, to the point where you are concentrating hard enough to see what he describes, even when you can’t.Generally, of course, you can see it: Springwatch has been back on screens, packed with the images – baby birds with their gaping maws, treecreepers blinking – we have always cherished and lately come to rely on. Packham, 59, has such a natural, contagious sincerity in his enthusiasm that he should be in the “national treasure” class, one of those rare figures who unites the country and is immune from politics. But he determinedly is not – he won’t, today, talk about grouse, hen harriers or any of those bird-cruelty issues that have brought him death threats of the most lurid kind (dead birds hung up by his gatepost, Twitter abuse too awful to detail). The BBC, I am given to understand, would prefer him not to speak on these topics. But in January he fell foul of the neutrality police in another way: while promoting his documentary about the global population, he said that, for the sake of the planet, people should consider having fewer children (he has no biological children).Packham admits the idea is controversial, but “I approach things as a pragmatic biologist”, he says, calmly. “There’s not a racist cell in my body I don’t think of humans as being different.” That was not my question, although he has been accused – nefariously, he says – of singling out countries such as Nigeria, and therefore pointing the finger at sub-Saharan Africa, when “the real problem is what you and I are consuming”. “Ultimately, we are all the same species, in the same place, at the same time, with the same problem, and if we don’t start thinking collectively to sort it out, then we won’t do it,” he says. “A global conversation about how many people the planet can sustain is something that has to happen.”\u0026nbspI happen to disagree – if you look at the recent work of the social geographer Danny Dorling, it shows that birth rates are already in decline worldwide we are entering a natural slowdown. What we have not managed to slow down is rich people’s consumption.But, in a way, this makes me admire Packham all the more: there is enough to contest in these choppy waters that he could avoid them altogether and still hold his head high as a passionate defender of the natural world. He does not play it safe, nor does he skirt the largest, most uncomfortable implications of his analysis. He worries constantly – about the IPCC’s warning that we have 10 years to solve the climate crisis, about the strongman politics dominating the world stage, about the loss of bioersity and the long-term impact that will have on harvests – but he does not\u0026nbspsound\u0026nbspworried. He sounds like a man telling you that your boiler is broken, but he knows how to fix it.We need better leaders, given that we are living under “undoubtedly the worst portfolio of politicians that we could possibly have imaged in our lifetime”, and we need to “shape a new world” after the pandemic, with the environment at the centre of our decision-making. On reflection, we all know how to fix this boiler, just as we all enjoy the sight of a ladybird, but it is soothing and exciting to hear it described.Packham always says of his early life, growing up in Hampshire, that he was a bit difficult, emotionally adrift, until he took a baby kestrel from its nest when he was 14 and fell violently in love with it. This led to a zoology degree, at the University of Southampton. He got into TV not via presenting, but in production, for the BBC’s 1984 series The Living Planet. His career as a presenter started with The Really Wild Show, in 1986, when he electrified the nature scene with his Gary Rhodes hair and his apparently effortless fluency.He has an endearing Dr Dolittle quality the defining images of his career capture him cuddling an animal or bird that does not like to be cuddled. Here he is with an owl, now with a badger. He is much more evangelist than showman.\u0026nbsp“I probably got as much joy out of other people reconnecting with nature as I have got from reconnecting with nature myself,” he says of the lockdown period. “It’s been an absolute joy to see people posting pictures with ladybirds on their fingers and frogs in their ponds and birds singing in their gardens, but they will now have to join our ranks and remember what they took from that, because we do have to fight for it.”As the pandemic confined us all to our homes, he and his 25-year-old stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, launched The Self-Isolating Bird Club: half an hour a day of guerrilla twitching, broadcast on Facebook every morning. “People seemed to like it,” he says (7.8 million of them tuned in). He and McCubbin have since taken their double act to Springwatch. “The producers of Springwatch liked our on-screen rapport. I call it bickering, they call it on-screen rapport.”\u0026nbspHe is keen to stress that McCubbin is a good, sound zoologist in her own right: “She knows her stuff, she likes science and understanding things. She loves finding out things that I don’t know and she does that very easily.” You would struggle to say who is the straight man of the double act – they are both incredibly, winningly geeky.McCubbin is the daughter of Packham’s ex-partner, Jo McCubbin. They split up years ago, but Packham remained a large and influential part of her life – she came to zoology partly thanks to time she spent at the Isle of Wight zoo run by Packham’s partner, Charlotte Corney. He describes these relationships as “a relatively confused – but not too unusual, these days – family setup.” They all get on very well. “Charlotte goes to Jo’s parties I don’t. I’m not a party sort of person.” (I am reminded of the joke about the doctor, the lawyer and the mathematician who are each asked whether it is better to have a wife or a mistress. The doctor says it is better for your health to be married. The lawyer says it is better for your finances to be unmarried. The mathematician says: “It is better to have a wife\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspa mistress – then they can chat and you can go off and do maths.”)He is relatively equanimous about the restrictions of the pandemic, as you might imagine of a person who does not like parties. But he is deadly serious about Covid-19. “Speaking entirely biologically, what the whole, horribly harsh, tragic lesson of the virus has taught us is that we are part of nature we’re not there to hold dominion over it, we’re not above it.“We’ve always been exposed to pathogens – everything from smallpox to bubonic plague. We’ve beaten them through our advances in science and I’m not regretting that. But we are an organism, living on a planet, and the way we were living was unsustainable. We were overcrowded, we were eating animals that we’d shipped alive from one part of the world to another, and we’re paying a terrible price for it.”This is not a million miles away from the putative Extinction Rebellion (XR) stickers, disavowed by the group as fake, that read “Corona is the cure, humans are the virus”. But he reiterates that he is not against medical advances he is very much in favour of people living long and healthy lives. Nevertheless, he does not situate the plight of mankind at the centre of his thinking we are no more than one part of an infinitely precious ecosystem – and we are the part causing the problems.This is the kernel of his radicalism – and no broadcaster’s duty of impartiality will make him disavow it, nor his support for XR and similar movements. “That’s the most positive thing that we’ve seen – Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future. All those young people have taken to the streets, in an informed way and in a peaceful way. That’s been absolutely heartening. That gives me a sense of hope.“And again, in the last week, we’ve seen all of these demonstrations because of continued racism. Some of them have been violent. I never support violence, but a lot of people are very, very angry. When people reach that tipping point, they no longer sit in bars they take to the streets and demand their rights. We need to be demanding a right to a healthy environment and I think we’ve started to do that.” (I spoke to Packham before the Bristol protest at which the statue of Edward Colston was torn down, so this should not be taken as a comment on that, but my impression is that his heart is with the angry protesters, rather than those bemoaning the civil unrest.)\u0026nbspIn his sentiment and his delivery – quietly passionate, unabashed by what is and is not considered acceptable – Packham is very like Greta Thunberg, who often says that she thinks her Asperger’s is part of what makes her the activist she is. She is not affected by convention or “the Overton window” (the range of policies deemed politically acceptable by the mainstream), but rather tells the truth as she sees it.Packham was diagnosed with Asperger’s in 2005 and has spoken openly about it since, although he does not describe it in terms of upsides. “I struggled terribly when I was younger. Not as a young child, but later, when I was an adolescent and going in to my 20s. And my hope in speaking about it openly was that young people wouldn’t suffer in the same way. Because if they had a better understanding, and the people around them had a better understanding, life would be a lot easier. And it’s been quite heart-rending more people come up to me and talk about autism than do about natural history.”His job, though, is the same in both cases – to explain things, he says, in relatively simple ways. “I don’t mean that in a patronising way. I just mean speaking frankly and plainly.”\u0026nbspThe last time I interviewed Packham was five years ago. Back then, while powerfully exercised about animal cruelty, he was much more comfortable on the territory of other species, patiently explaining why he preferred birds to mammals (“I like feathers better than fur I think eggs are neater than placental matter I like things that fly rather than things that walk and – this is a subjective thing – they’re a more beautiful organism”). But the geopolitical intensity of the world we are in now draws him back constantly to our species. “Let’s be honest: a lot of the governments that have mishandled the corona crisis are not going to survive it. I sincerely hope that there will be a huge peaceful shake-up and people will start moving in the right direction.”While he is careful about which governments he means, he is resolute about the right direction: away from fossil fuels and flying away from careless consumption away from considering the natural world a resource to exploit. We are good at solutions, but only under pressure. “One of the stats that I’m always drawn to is that, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, in 1941, 7 December, America was producing 4m cars a year. From that point until the end of the war, they only produced 141. That’s how powerful our ability to respond to problems is. They used that capacity to produce weapons.”I am surprised by the parable – it does not feel like humanity at its finest, that, when push comes to shove, we will throw everything we have at killing each other better. But he is not a sentimentalist – whether or not we are capable of great change, we are certainly capable of huge change – and that is what the world needs. I thought I detected a note of optimism, but he had returned to his house and was eating toast, so it may have been blood sugar.\u0026nbspSpringwatch is on BBC Two at 8pm every night until Friday previous episodes from this season are available to stream on BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d343c1bb4d37155065b0bef614d25b47e6bcfae0/0_401_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c77d448fa86782058410699c5ba6fc9","title":"spiky hairy shiny la abuzz with new insect discoveries in pictures aoe","story":"Since 2014, entomologists have sampled millions of insects around the city, identifying 800 species, including 47 new to science.

But it’s really the presiding metaphor for the fervid energy and uncontrollable drive towards independence in the life that follows: that of the Gaviria family’s third daughter, Paola, rendered in outstanding black-and-white animation by debut director Santiago Caicedo.Adapted from graphic novelist Power Paola’s memoir, Virus Tropical is simultaneously a domestic saga (maybe influenced by the telenovelas to which it makes the odd ironic nod), portrait of an artist as a put-upon youngest child and a chronicle of a maturing South America. The paterfamilias, Uriel, leaves the household to return to the priesthood, and Hilda – who makes a living through psychic domino reading – is left to raise her three daughters largely alone. All three must find their own way to self-liberate from a caring but constrictive Catholic upbringing.Virus Tropical doesn’t bother offsetting its family story against the kind of grand political bas-relief favoured by many graphic-novel memoirs (most notably, perhaps, Persepolis). Instead, it expresses itself purely in miniature, like little Paola with her Ken and Barbie dolls. Packed with wry detail, the film is a consistently eye-catching pop-up of life in Quito and, in Paola’s teen years, the Colombian city of Cali the animation honours Power Paola’s stylised, almost Picasso-like character doodles, while augmenting them with slick computerised 3D that still manages to seem highly textured and handmade.Paola’s destiny as an artistic wayfarer means that Virus Tropical is prone to a twee indie tendency that arguably robs it of a true ending. But while it doesn’t quite have the symphonic discipline of Roma, it achieves a comparable prismatic intimacy to Alfonso Cuarón’s film. The constant wash of visual beauty is entirely apt for a life and times in alarming motion, but always regulated by love.• Virus Tropical is available on Mubi from 11 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d34d17d3ea60e1554398d43bfc982e6904fed2/0_0_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df083ffae266b933c5080d02d159cc33","title":"david athertons recipe for ajo blanco cold soup andalucian classic","story":"Cold soup isn’t for everyone – but you should really try this punched-up Andalucian classic after a workoutI remember the first time I had gazpacho.

The only certainty is that this won’t be the jambalaya your momma made, but it is still delicious.½ tsp white peppercorns½ tsp black peppercorns1 tsp paprika1 tsp cayenne (or more if using a very mild sausage)1 tsp dried thyme2 bay leaves½ tsp salt2 tbsp lard or neutral oil2 smoked pork sausages (see step 2)4 bone-in chicken thighs1 onion1 stick celery1 green pepper3 garlic cloves4 spring onions800ml chicken or pork stock1 tsp Tabasco, or other hot sauce, plus extra to serve300g long-grain rice (not easy-cook)300g large raw prawnsThis is a recipe for the drier style of jambalaya, often described as Cajun. If you are looking for the soupier, tomato-rich, red Creole version, add a 400g tin of chopped tomatoes along with the stock and reduce the latter to 500ml (or consult the chef Brad McDonald’s book Deep South for a dedicated recipe).American andouille are hard to get in the UK (although McDonald’s book can teach you to make your own), so Polish smoked sausage (fresh rather than dried), smoked cooking chorizo or anything with a high meat content, ideally smoked, will work. If you are using something without much spice, compensate by adding a little more cayenne pepper to the spice mix in step 3. To make this vegetarian, replace the sausage with a smoked, meat-free version, the stock with vegetable stock, and add beans or vegetables of your choice (okra would be apt) instead of the chicken.Toast the peppercorns, paprika and cayenne in a small, dry pan over a high heat, until they smell toasty, stirring regularly to make sure the spices don’t burn. Then tip into a mortar or electric grinder, leave to cool slightly and grind until smooth. Stir in the thyme, bay and salt, and set aside.Cut the sausage into thick slices. Heat the oil in a wide pan (ideally one with a lid, but you can use foil if not) over a medium-high heat. Fry the sausage until the meat is browned and the fat has begun to render, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. In the same pan, fry the chicken in the sausage fat until lightly golden all over (leave on or remove the skin as you prefer).While the meat is cooking, peel the onion and finely chop it and the celery, then seed and finely chop the pepper. Peel and crush the garlic and chop the spring onion, separating the white and green parts. Add the whites to the rest of the vegetables and set aside the greens.Transfer the chicken to a second paper-lined plate and turn down the heat under the pan to medium-low. Tip in the onion, celery, pepper, garlic and spring onion whites and cook, stirring regularly, until soft (and, in the case of the onion, translucent). Stir in the spice mix and cook for another couple of minutes, being careful not to burn it.Return the chicken to the pan and pour in the stock and Tabasco (or other hot sauce). Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat and bubble gently for about 15 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked through – it will continue to cook in the pan, so don’t worry if it is still a bit pink.Stir in the rice, leave to simmer for 10 minutes, then stir once, cover tightly with a lid (or foil), turn down the heat and leave to steam for 15 minutes. Take out the chicken, stir the rice briefly, then add the prawns and sausage to the mix. Cover tightly again, take off the heat and leave to sit for 10 minutes.In the meantime, shred the chicken, discarding the bones. Season the rested jambalaya with salt and more hot sauce if necessary, then fold in the shredded chicken and scatter with the chopped green spring onion before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d487276ff32a6a3f6a7df5fdec41c65d66d68f04/42_0_4898_2939/master/4898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb20393e0c5b876e0eb9681f895163e4","title":"black lives matter racism in football and representation in sports media football weekly special","story":"Max Rushden, Troy Townsend, Elliot Ross and Jordan Jarrett-Bryan discuss football’s reaction to the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd and ask whether this reaction is good enough.

Smartphone shopping, augmented-reality changing rooms, same-day delivery (perhaps soon by drone) – with so much innovative e-commerce out there, you would think that small and micro businesses were tooled to the hilt with technology. In reality, nearly half of UK small businesses lack even the most basic of 21st-century gizmos: a website.In recent months, consumer spending has dropped significantly because of Covid-19, but where money is being spent, it is likely to be through online purchases, so a website is more essential than ever if a business is to thrive. In fact, a survey for the website builder GoDaddy found that lockdown has prompted a fifth of micro businesses to set up an online presence for the first time, while nearly half of such businesses have boosted their digital and social media activity.Some savvy small businesses are tapping into this trend by using their websites to create additional opportunities for consumers to spend. Online promotions, reward schemes and e-gift cards are just some of the ways businesses can help keep customers returning.Promotions (vouchers, discounts and deals) are a great way to attract new customers and keep them coming back for more, as are contests, giveaways and flash sales. Meanwhile, free deliveries and automatic replenishment of perishables using a subscription model have become increasingly popular in the e-commerce world. Placing time limits on deals can create a sense of urgency and encourage uptake.Another way to spur bigger purchases is to create product or service bundles, or to cross-sell complementary items. Multi-buy deals – such as three for two – can result in a larger shopping basket too. And what about the customer who leaves your website without purchasing the items in their cart? A reminder email might entice them back.But be warned about heavy discounting, if it’s not done properly, businesses can end up reducing the perceived value of their products or services.Ultimately, it’s crucial to benchmark the results of any promotion against your regular pricing to see which strategy has the most positive impact on the top line.For small businesses, the prospect of running promotions can seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be if you know where to look. GoDaddy has created a suite of email marketing tools specifically designed with small businesses in mind. These tools let clients quickly and easily send out notifications about promotions, and even automate them to lighten the load.And to help you get to know your customers better – who they are and what resonates with them – GoDaddy makes it simple for its clients to create surveys and monitor the results. All of which will help you run your business in a way that bolsters your bottom line.Reward schemes differ from online promotions in that they encourage repeat purchases over an extended period.The added benefit is that your business can gather data on consumer behaviour and satisfaction, so you can tailor products or services to their needs. Your customers may also spread the word about your loyalty scheme and encourage others to join.For customers, there are many benefits – saving money and time, winning prizes, and early access to products, services or events. Communicating the advantages of a scheme is one of the keys to its success.Typically, customers earn “points” when they buy from you, refer friends or post about your business on social media. You can also award points for anniversaries and business milestones.Shoppers can be automatically enrolled when they make their first purchase, or can opt in via your app, website or social media channels. Customers then redeem their points to get products free or at a discount.Remember to take time periodically reviewing the performance of the programme. You can choose which metrics you measure – whether it’s number of members, or rewards earned or claimed – but it’s important to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and how to improve the programme.Digital gift cards could be the ultimate guarantor of customer loyalty during the pandemic. They’re not just a source of immediate income, they are an endorsement of your business from the giver and a warranty that you’ll gain a future customer. What’s more, they are a relatively cheap marketing tool that spreads awareness of your brand.Some businesses combine e-gift cards with promotions offering future discounts, which they hope will encourage recipients of e-gift cards to return and spend more.This makes sense as the cost of acquiring new customers can be far higher than retaining existing customers. And those existing customers are much more likely to try out new products and to spend more as their trust grows. This underscores the importance of a loyalty scheme for small businesses.Developments in technology might be moving at a rate of knots, but small businesses needn’t be left behind. Beyond the bells and whistles of drones and augmented reality, there is a world of opportunity for entrepreneurs. And it all begins with a website.GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at\u0026nbspOpenWeStand.org\u0026nbspto help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

But Mallya, who\u0026nbsplives in an £11.5m mansion in the Hertfordshire village of Tewin,\u0026nbspdelayed the process via appeals.The high court in April rejected Mallya’s appeal, ruling that there was a “prima facie\u0026nbspcase of fraud by false representation”, setting Mallya on the path for extradition within 28 days.However, Mallya is understood to have sought asylum in the UK under article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which prohibits\u0026nbsp“inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.Mallya’s lawyer, Anand Doobay of law firm Boutique Law, said they are not commenting on this case. Clare\u0026nbspMontgomery QC, who represented Mallya in his failed appeal against extradition, also declined to comment.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The extradition of Vijay Mallya was ordered on 3 February 2019. As this an ongoing legal case it would not be appropriate to comment further.”News of Mallya’s application for asylum was first reported by India’s CNBC-TV18.Mallya, the self-proclaimed “king of the good times”, is alleged to have knowingly misled largely Indian state-owned banks about the fortunes of his failing Kingfisher Airlines, before laundering the cash to fund the defunct Force India Formula One team and other projects.He has previously dismissed the allegations that he fled India leaving a trail of £977m worth of debts as “ludicrous” and said the charges were politically motivated.A judge ruled in December 2018 that Mallya had misrepresented how loans from Indian banks had been used and the decision on his extradition was approved by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid.The senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot described Mallya as a “glamorous, flashy, famous, bejewelled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy who charmed and cajoled these bankers into losing their common sense and persuading them to put their own rules and regulations to one side”.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has singled out Mallya for criticism, accusing him of ripping off\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand Indians.“There is no place for corruption in India,” Modi said in previous comments referring to Mallya. “Those who looted the poor and middle classes will have to return what they have looted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68967ac24fde2a7643c6fc82b4c5ef5549c2301d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=455a663cd450e16235ca102c9a018b92","title":"weddings cancel end","story":"Starting your life together with a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism is a relic of a bygone time – let’s leave it thereNone of us are going to be going to weddings anytime soon. In many states and cities, what we see as traditional weddings, with large gatherings of people, have been banned. We are living through a period defined by its disappointments, by concert debuts that will not happen, by plays that will not launch, by aborted careers and, yes, by grand wedding dreams that will never reach fulfillment.The disappointments of missed weddings are no doubt painful. But the truth is that a re-evaluation of the contemporary wedding was already well overdue.In 2019, the wedding industry is, or rather was, worth $70bn, and that’s in the United States alone, and that doesn’t include honeymoons. It was pure madness. Many industries are going to have be be reconsidered in the wake of the economic shutdown, and weddings should be at the top of the list. Like the cruise industry, we should just let it die.\u0026nbspHalf a century ago, marriage meant big life changes:\u0026nbsplosing your virginity,\u0026nbspmoving in, merging bank accounts, having kids. But now, three-quarters of couples already live together. They split the bills. They share a bed. Marriage is not a requirement to be an adult any more.\u0026nbspNonetheless, we maintain these supposedly necessary traditions. The most widespread collective response to the approach of gender equality has been that, in our most significant public declarations of love and commitment, women dress up like they’re minor members of the Russian royal family from the 19th century and men dress up like they’re waiters on cruise liners. I guess it’s good to begin any major phase in life with a consciousness of your own ridiculousness, but surely there ought to be limits.And then there is the cost. The average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $32,329. The median cost for a house in the States that year was $200,000, according to Zillow. Do the math: the average cost of a wedding is a serious downpayment on an average house. You start off the period of your life when you really need money by collecting it in a pile and burning it. A big wedding makes leasing a sports car look like a good financial decision.Spending all that money on a wedding won’t make you happier, it won’t make your marriage stronger. The opposite, in fact. In 2015, social scientists in Singapore did the work. In ‘A Diamond is Forever’ and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration,\u0026nbspthey found marriage duration is inversely associated with the spending on the ceremony and the engagement ring. The more you spend, the shorter the marriage lasts. But that’s obvious any time you go to a wedding. You can tell how unhappy a couple is by the size of the flower arrangements.\u0026nbsp(For the record, my wife and I eloped in the aftermath of September 11. We were, according to lifestyle journalists at the time, a “terror marriage”.)\u0026nbspThe idea that you need to have the big wedding because of “tradition”? The “tradition” behind weddings was all thought up by Madison Avenue types a hundred years ago. Karen Dunak, a history professor at Muskingum University in Ohio, wrote As Long as We Both Shall Love: The White Wedding in Postwar America. It’s a fascinating history of the consumerist nonsense that is the modern wedding. “When you have this rise and this increased democratization of a consumer culture in the 1920s, this is when you have more wedding registries this is when you have department stores that would have wedding departments,” she told me. “This is when you have the commercialization of a lot of services related to the wedding. That you would have bakers who make wedding cakes, you would have wedding boutiques, you would have florists who would make wedding arrangements rather than people doing it as a part of home craft.”The tradition of huge elaborate ceremonies followed by enormous parties, all at vast expense, belongs to the recent past of unparalleled growth. That period is over. It’s time to make some new traditions – vastly, vastly cheaper ones.Before Covid-19, a wedding was a way to begin your life together in a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism. That is what a pre-Covid wedding forced you to do: it forced you to turn your love into a lifestyle. It forced you to turn your private life into a big display. There was enormous social pressure to engage in what is obviously a folly: to begin adulthood by lying, by making up fraudulent histories, by pretending that you’re independent, by grotesque and unoriginal conspicuous consumption.\u0026nbspCovid-19 is ruining a great many beautiful things, glorious art, wonderful meetings, even love itself. But this destruction – the destruction of the wedding industry –\u0026nbspwe should take for what it is, a blessing in disguise. Let’s not let the insanity back. We should keep weddings right where they are, right now: nowhere.\u0026nbspStephen Marche’s audio series How Not to F*ck Up Your Marriage Too Bad is available on Audible June 11"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2037774804774e6a1feb1a52bf3c9e59602bc553/0_186_5607_3364/master/5607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397613b0e3a3f45e2bc7b0a465dc1d12","title":"forget burnout there is nothing worse than a boring job","story":"Being severely underworked can bring depression, illness and – for one French employee – a tasty payoutAge: As old as employment, but the term itself was coined in 2007 by two Swiss business consultants, Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin.I guess somebody has been working too hard. To be honest, I’m hardly working.\u0026nbspSounds like my dream job! Be careful what you wish for. You may end up suffering from boreout.\u0026nbspIs that like burnout? It’s similar, but with a very different cause. It turns out that being severely underworked can also lead to depression, illness and, in some cases, a huge payout for damages.\u0026nbspThis is so not a thing.\u0026nbspIt so is. A Paris appeals court just upheld a boreout claim by a former Interparfums employee, Frederic Desnard, awarding him €40,000 (£36,000).\u0026nbspPlease state the facts of the case.\u0026nbspOnce a busy and fulfilled worker, Desnard was sidelined after the company lost a big contract in 2010. He was then transferred to a post where “no one cared if I arrived at 9am or 10am”.I do wish they would advertise these jobs more widely. Desnard’s duties were almost nonexistent. “I had to buy some supplies – a few sheets of paper – and then my day was over,” he said.\u0026nbspSeriously, just get me to the interview stage, and I will nail this. The lack of work soon took a psychological toll. “You go on the internet at first,” said Desnard, “and then you shut yourself in an empty office and you cry.”That just sounds like work to me.\u0026nbspDesnard became depressed and had an epileptic fit at the wheel of his car. He took seven months off work and was sacked in 2014, on the grounds that his prolonged absence disrupted the smooth running of the company.\u0026nbspThey couldn’t run the company without someone who didn’t do anything? His lawyer made the same point.\u0026nbspWould it be prejudiced of me to describe the whole notion of boreout as very French? Perhaps not. Under French labour laws it is difficult to make employees redundant. Instead, they are often sidelined or shelved – mis à l’écart – in the hope they will get bored and quit.\u0026nbspI don’t know which is more French – getting paid to do nothing or complaining about it.\u0026nbspDesnard argued it was a form of psychological harassment.\u0026nbspI would describe it as a modest promotion, myself.\u0026nbspUnfortunately for you, the court agreed with Desnard.\u0026nbspDo say: “It is important that companies ensure their employees are neither overworked nor underworked.”Don’t say: “What’s the name of the illness you get when your job is too interesting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05b625877df0b11425e57b658ce7c44a38d23b5/0_356_4664_2797/master/4664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b11e5e17fef90487662d08516a53b32","title":"living in england are you planning to move out of a city","story":"We would like to hear from people who are relocating outside cities due to the coronavirus pandemicWith estate agents in England allowed to conduct viewings via video or appointments where people are physical distancing, some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid a rise in home working.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving away from an urban area we want to hear from you.What are your reasons for moving out of the city?

With no income, many arts organisations are burning through reserves and, without targeted help, some will not survive.In a letter to the , Rattle, the music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Elder, the music director of the Hallé Orchestra, describe classical music’s situation as desperate.“There’s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality.”The Wigmore Hall in London has started recitals with no live audience and organisers of the BBC Proms are hopeful of two weeks of concerts in late summer, probably with no audience.But orchestral music is essentially a live experience, Rattle and Elder write, “and requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do inidually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of\u0026nbspspace, art and emotion which is both vital and healing.”They say learning to play while physically distanced will be harder than it may seem, but it has to happen.“We MUST find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline, of when that might be and how it can be implemented. We understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before\u0026nbspwe will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems.”Rattle and Elder said they were hopeful that music would weather the pandemic. “We refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.”The government has set up a cultural renewal taskforce to help plot a way back for the the UK’s recreation and leisure industries and there has been criticism that no representatives from music are on the taskforce. Ministers argue music is well represented on the important workgroups set up to develop guidance for reopening.Rattle and Elder point to the experience in mainland Europe where orchestras are gradually opening up and finding ways to deal with physical distancing.They write: “In the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness.”The West End producer Sonia Friedman\u0026nbsphas said\u0026nbspthe performing arts face “the real possibility of complete obliteration” without substantial government support, while the director\u0026nbspSam Mendes said\u0026nbsp“an ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch”.Industry leaders say they are not after a bailout, but investment which will prevent parts of Britain’s world leading arts sector going bust just at the moment it is most needed.The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said this week that he was involved in “intricate discussions” with the Treasury and suggested a deal was almost done. “I am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed,” he said.“Of course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.”There are so many pressing problems to solve in the UK that it takes courage even to mention the desperate situation of classical music in the time of Covid-19.There’s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality. What we write applies, of course, to all types of music, not just classical music which is our area of expertise. Our music is essentially a live experience and requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do inidually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of\u0026nbspspace, art and emotion which is both vital and healing.This healing will become ever more necessary\u0026nbspin the coming time as we attempt to bear witness and understand what we have all gone through. In such an existential crisis, the realisation of our shared vulnerability\u0026nbspwill surely change and deepen our relationship to all the arts. In our own field we are asking ourselves how can we get back to live music? How can we give our audiences the courage to gradually return?More immediately, how can we maintain musical continuity when orchestras are silenced? And how do we nurture a generation of young musicians whose prospects look bleak just as they embark on a career in this ever more uncertain world?The recent extension of the furlough scheme is a blessing and enables many organisations to hang on. For freelance musicians, which include four of the London orchestras among others, huge problems remain. Currently many freelancers fall between the cracks of the government’s self-employment schemes. We need to find a way to sustain some kind of backbone of income so that we will eventually be able to play whenever that will be possible. At the most basic level, despite all appearances to the contrary, musicians are humans. They need to eat and pay their bills. But we also need to play together and train, just like any sports team, albeit in a totally new environment. Crucially, this musical team is part of a complex structure that is focussed around, and serves, its home town or city.We will have to reinvent the wheel in so many ways. Learning to play while remaining distanced from each other will be much harder than it may initially seem.All musicians of whatever genre share the magnificent problem of an art form which is, fundamentally, songs transmitted to people in a room. When will our audiences have the chance to experience this once more?We refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.In Mainland Europe orchestras are gradually opening up and finding different ways to deal with the problems of distancing. Good practice is being built up: in the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b59c986b7694d7ac96c3f66e3562c94f8326912/0_505_4422_2652/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5b793456c1c6e18c796fb27f7011756","title":"patti smith where to start in her back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the hugely influential poet who brought Baudelaire to punkWhen, in 1971, the music producer and manager Sandy Pearlman approached Patti Smith and suggested she front a rock band, she laughed off the suggestion as ridiculous. She saw herself as a poet and a painter. Between shifts at the New York bookstore where she worked, Smith would perform readings of her verse at small clubs alongside Lenny Kaye, who provided blasts of feedback on guitar. Smith and Pearlman became friends anyway four years later, she finally his took advice and made the landmark punk album Horses. REM’s Michael Stipe later said it “tore my limbs off and put them back on in a whole new order”.Punk is rarely noted for its literary qualities, though Smith was unapologetic in her love of the French poets Genet, Baudelaire and Rimbaud. Her songwriting on Horses revelled in intricate phrasing and imagery, and deliberately blurred the lines between punk and poetry. It also stuck two fingers up at punk’s self-imposed two-minute rule –\u0026nbspa response to prog’s perceived self-indulgence – with some tracks exceeding nine minutes.Gloria (In Excelsis Deo), a re-working of a Them song, with its immortal first line “Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine”, remains the perfect encapsulation of Smith’s spirit: transgressive, hypnotic, determinedly true to herself and her art. At a time when women musicians were expected to trade on their femininity, there was nothing pretty about her delivery. It was urgent, often incantatory, given to stretching vowels (“people say ‘bewaaaaaaare’, but I don’t caaaaaaare”) and turning them into sneers. Elsewhere, there are tales of suicide (Redondo Beach), an alien visitation (Birdland), a lightning storm (Kimberly) and a boy who breaks out of his skin and flies away (Break it Up), many of them incendiary and intense, and anchored by the spiky garage rock of the era.If Horses gave the impression that Smith’s path would be unyieldingly left-field, her third LP set us straight. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, who would go on to work with U2 and Dire Straits, Easter was, by comparison, polished and accessible, and yielded a bona fide hit in Because the Night, a joyful, air-punching ode to hedonism and love – more Pat Benatar than Baudelaire. The song, partly written by Bruce Springsteen who happened to be recording down the corridor from Smith, irked some fans who accused her of selling out, but she didn’t care. “I liked hearing myself on the radio,” she told New York Magazine. “To me, those people didn’t understand punk rock at all. Punk rock is just another word for freedom.”\u0026nbspSmith took much of the 80s and 90s out to raise her two children, a decision she has said came easily given her reluctance as a rock star. But then a series of deaths brought her back to songwriting, including that of her friend and former partner Robert Mapplethorpe in 1989, and her husband, the MC5 guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith, her brother Todd, and her friend Kurt Cobain, who all died in 1994. Unusually confessional, and more subtle and folksy than her previous works, Gone Again is a stunning elegy to those she lost as well as a document of her path to healing.As you move through her career, Smith’s albums become increasingly hit and miss, though even the misses have their moments, each bearing testament to her dedication to profundity and poeticism. Banga, her 11th album, has no duds. The pleasingly in-your-face title track comes from the Russian novelist Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita and features dogs barking in the background, while Constantine’s Dream is inspired by Piero della Francesca’s fresco sequence The History of the True Cross. Loosely themed around the concept of exploration, the album brims with poetic rapture, and is interspersed with tender songs such as April Fool, in which lovers “race through alleyways in tattered coats” and This Is the Girl, a sweet tribute to Amy Winehouse.The infamous B-side to Smith’s first single was her first fully-fledged “rock’n’roll poem”. A cri de coeur against production-line drudgery, it told of the time she worked, aged 16, in a baby buggy factory in New Jersey where she would hide in the basement and dream of a different life. Piss Factory is mostly spoken rather than sung, the words delivered against improvised, often frenzied piano. It tells of the futility of the job, the foul conditions and the workers who “got no teeth or gum or cranium”. Smith didn’t see eye to eye with her colleagues, who were incensed by the copy of Rimbaud’s Illuminations in her pocket and instructed her to leave it at home. When she reappeared with it the next day, they dunked her head in a toilet bowl of urine to teach her a lesson. Hence, “piss factory”.M Train, by Patti SmithJust Kids, Smith’s 2010 memoir of her youthful partnership with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, is obviously excellent but her 2015 book, M Train, offers a delicious insight into who she is now. Between tours and speaking engagements, her time is spent taking photographs, sitting in coffee shops writing in her notebook, basking in memories of dead loved ones and, for relaxation, watching re-runs of Morse.Patti Smith: Dream of LifeThis lyrical documentary, directed by Steven Sebring and full of terrific archive footage, is an intimate portrait of Smith in which she talks politics, love, grief and the compulsion to create. “I always felt something different stirring in me,” the twentysomething Smith says of her move to New York. “I knew there was stuff inside me that would flower. Maybe it would ruin me.”\u0026nbspRevenge of the She-Punks, by Vivian GoldmanGoldman’s examination of the hard-won achievements of women artists includes an illuminating chapter on Smith, whom she sees as “a new breed of autonomous, self-defined and uninhibited female rock star”, and where, in 1976, the pair meet up and sift through secondhand clothes in Notting Hill. Unused to having money and keen to share the love, Smith ends up buying Goldman a jacket.

Urging the British government to “revise its negotiation position”, the text states that a level playing field is the “necessary condition for the European parliament to give its consent to a trade agreement with the UK”.\u0026nbspThe level playing field – common standards on environment, workers’ rights and state subsidies for companies – is one of the main stumbling blocks of Brexit talks that has contributed to the current deadlock.The parliament’s text underlines the narrow room for manoeuvre available to the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who last week hinted at a possible concession on state aid – the rules that limit government subsidies for companies. Barnier declined to back publicly the EU’s opening demand that European rules on state aid must be written into UK law.\u0026nbspThe parliament resolution, however, states that EU standards must be safeguarded to avoid a “race to the bottom”, while revealing little slack to escape the EU’s opening position of matching EU rules on state aid – so-called “dynamic alignment”.Brussels sources have played down talk of imminent compromise on the crucial issue of state aid.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn\u0027t enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own partyThe UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron\u0027s resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime ministerAfter years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May\u0027s attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU.EU officials want to see a common approach on state aid that means the UK and EU would move together in adapting rules in response to the economic outlook.In recent weeks, many EU restrictions on company bailouts and subsidies have been lifted in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Brussels wants to ensure similar coordination between EU and UK state aid rules in future. “But the substance doesn’t exist right now,” an EU official said. “We made important commitments in the political declaration. The UK\u0026nbsphas not followed up on this. And it is also worrying that we have no idea what the UK state aid control system will look like as of 1 January 2020.”State aid was one of the most difficult issues, said an EU diplomat, who added it was too early to speak of a compromise.British officials have also played down talk of a breakthrough on state aid – and there were no detailed discussions in the latest round of talks.In a recent letter to Barnier, the UK chief negotiator, David Frost, described the EU’s demand that the UK accept state aid rules as “egregious”. Sources say the government cannot be constrained in its ability to run its own rules on state aid. Meanwhile, Brussels has low expectations of a reset emerging from a meeting between Boris Johnson and the EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, expected later this month. Attention is focusing instead on whether the next round of talks – pencilled in for early July – can proceed in a different way to help the search for compromise.The European parliament’s trade and foreign affairs committees will vote on the draft resolution on Friday, while all MEPs will be able to have their say next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c02f0f7079fab7b782adab0dbbfabed7ef8d278/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57e3810171171df0a3b4c4d672aab6a7","title":"switch from public transport could put 1m more cars on english and welsh roads","story":"Research warns of impact of physical distancing unless councils boost cyclingA million more cars could be on the road in England and Wales each day if public transport commuters with cars switch to driving, research has warned.The government has told the public to avoid buses, trams and trains and to walk, cycle or drive instead, with some estimates suggesting public transport capacity will be cut to a sixth or less of its former rate to accommodate physical distancing.However, the analysis also found that with rapid changes to road layouts and new policies to make walking and cycling safer and more attractive, up to half of all public transport journeys –\u0026nbspthose of 10km (6.2 miles) or less – could be made by bike or on foot, resulting in up to 2m more active journeys than before the pandemic.Such a big switch would aid physical distancing, and the increase in physical exercise alone would avert at least 500 premature deaths annually. Such a move would also prevent a post-lockdown rise in carbon emissions that could jeopardise climate change goals.\u0026nbspLast month the government announced £225m for local authorities in England to create pop-up cycle lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and bike and bus-only corridors. On Wednesday it also announced that from 22 June, local authorities will have new powers to use\u0026nbspCCTV\u0026nbspto issue penalty charge notices to drivers who park or load illegally in mandatory cycle lanes – those demarcated with a solid white line, meaning motorists are not allowed to enter – thus putting cyclists at risk of a serious accident.Some councils have already announced ambitious plans to get people cycling and walking during the pandemic, while others have been paralysed by infighting. The West Midlands combined authority said on Tuesday it was spending £3.4m on various temporary measures, including a pop-up cycle lane from Coventry city centre to Birmingham canal basin and shutting much of Wolverhampton city centre to cars.Leicester has introduced a key workers corridor for people cycling to work and Transport for London recently announced a new protected bike lane on Euston Road.In Greater Manchester, a row kicked off at the weekend after it emerged Manchester city council had refused to build any pop-up cycle lanes to help commuters from the surrounding nine districts get into the city and was instead concentrating on pedestrianising parts of the centre. understands that the nine boroughs all want to install segregated bike lanes on key routes into Manchester, but that the city council’s refusal to cooperate means they all stop abruptly at the Manchester border.Andrew Gwynne, the MP for Denton and Reddish – which straddles the Greater Manchester boroughs of Tameside and Stockport –\u0026nbsphas accused the city council of “endangering lives and potentially increasing air pollution” by refusing to help people cycling in to Manchester from those districts.On Friday the city council said it did not support temporary cycling infrastructure, saying: “Long-term, sustainable modal shift to bikes is best supported through investment in creating safe, durable cycling infrastructure.”But on Wednesday it softened its position, saying: “Where neighbouring local authorities are planning to create temporary pop-up cycle lanes which approach\u0026nbspManchester, the\u0026nbspcouncil\u0026nbspwill work with partners in each case, to ensure that safety for all road users is prioritised.”At his weekly press conference on Wednesday. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said the region had submitted a £21.5m bid to the government for temporary measures to improve walking and cycling, including 200km of pop-up bike lanes, 94km of which are on “strategic routes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f395586547da441e4671d1f8081585df77940f/196_299_1869_1122/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d967c7071d7e435751de35073a362884","title":"bluetooth or wifi a jargon free guide to connecting your audio to your smart devices","story":"Technology writer Holly Brockwell explains how to make the most of headphone-free listeningIn the streaming age, it’s easier than ever to connect up your tech so you can listen to all the best music and podcasts wherever you want, without wires trailing everywhere. If you’re one of Spotify’s 286 million monthly users, you’ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker – that’s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work – and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it – Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won’t stop if you receive a call.Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap “devices available” underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you’ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don’t have to add them, they appear automatically if they’re connected to wifi.The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.There’s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but you can check here just in case.Once you’re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn’t run your battery down, either.Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you’re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.And when it’s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist – another feature you can’t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You’ll see the option to “Start a group session” at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called “pairing” and is usually simple to do – for instance, on many speakers, there’s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you’re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you’re stuck.Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once – from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out – something you don’t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you’ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it’s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you’re streaming from.The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it’s worth trying a different method.Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it’s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands – such as “OK Google, play Spotify”.The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don’t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever’s playing the music is connected to wifi, you’re good – and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you’ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Before that his last competitive outing was at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December 2019. Using the current season’s cars is banned under regulations so Hamilton took to the track using the Mercedes W09 from 2018, a car with which he won the world championship. With the season starting with an intense programme of three races in succession, putting in time behind the wheel in advance was seen as essential.Hamilton completed a substantial period of running in wet and dry conditions and pronounced himself very satisfied with the results.“When you leave the garage the first time, you get this buzz, and it doesn’t matter how many years you do it, it always feels new and fresh,” he said. “Obviously this is an older car, but it still felt fantastic. We got through a solid programme today.“I didn’t feel like I’ve ever left the water, so that’s a positive. Every time you take a big break – I think it’s been 103 days or something – you always wonder whether you can still drive. So it’s a good feeling to know of course I can, I’m ready, I feel fit.”Mercedes ran a similar test for Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, on Tuesday and applied their new operating protocols across both days. F1 is intending to run each race as a closed biosphere and teams are expected to commit to minimising risks. The Mercedes crew operated wearing face masks, and in some cases full facial protection for team members who had to operate in proximity to drivers – such as when they are being strapped into the car. All team members were practising physical distancing and were tested for coronavirus before they got to the circuit. All returned negative results and Hamilton wore a face mask when he was not in the car.The team implemented a range of procedures including a full grid-start simulation. When racing resumes the starting-grid process will involve a far more limited number of personnel than is usual.Ferrari are expected to run a similar programme at their test track in Fiorano. The F1 season opens with races in Austria on 5 and 12 July before a third in Budapest on 19 July, all held behind closed doors. Subject to the sport being granted exemption from the government’s 14-day quarantine restriction, Silverstone will then host races on 2 August and 9 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c7cb9f3bbb99031a6d460f0878b48544a4042dd/0_168_5700_3422/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=977d6e1f74d8e0764d23daf20d116b01","title":"mark gatiss on madness of george iii nottingham playhouse national theatre stream","story":"The star of Nottingham Playhouse’s The Madness of George III, streamed for National Theatre at Home, talks about royalty, lockdown and theatre’s futureThis play is about King George III’s “madness”, but its cause is not entirely clear. Do you have your own theory about the source of his collapse?The only thing that dates the play is a diagnosis of “porphyria”, which turns urine blue. That was the fashionable reasoning of the time. My feeling is that he had a massive mental breakdown: he had lost several children and he was one of those kings, like George VI, who was not really fitted to monarchy and might have been a farmer instead, but he had an enormous sense of duty.Do you think the way we regard mental illness has changed significantly since the play was first performed in 1991?People definitely feel more able to talk about it but the stigma hasn’t gone away. As a country, we tend to want to sweep things under the carpet. But all of the campaigns are very helpful, and we are in a different place to where we were in the early 90s. We had a whole day in rehearsals when we discussed how to talk about mental health.The king’s doctors come across as comical and clueless and George tells Dr Willis (played by Adrian Scarborough), who leads him to recovery, that it was time that cured his illness, not treatment. Do you think that to be true?I think that the king wanted to own his recovery. Part of the characterisation of the doctors as comical or cruel is down to dramatic necessity. Dr Willis has to be different from the others – the saviour whose methods involve a regime of hard work, fresh air and getting outside to reconnect with nature, plants, flowers, which even today might be beneficial in lockdown. The big problem for the king’s doctors was that they weren’t allowed to touch him without his consent but Dr Willis said he had to treat the king like any other patient.Are you writing in lockdown or binge-watching TV?I’m mostly painting and do it almost every day. I’m writing a bit and have written my adaptation of\u0026nbspA Christmas Carol, but being in the middle of a global emergency is not conducive to the muse. This will be remembered as the year that never happened. If we knew that we’d be back to normal by January we’d have a framework, but not knowing eats away at creativity. Most writers usually write in a vacuum, but I keep coming back to the question: “What’s it for?”Sam Mendes recently called for companies like Netflix and Amazon to help fix the arts after the lockdown, given the profits they have made during it. What do you think about this?It’s complicated. It would be wonderful if this wasn’t just a gesture but a proper fund – but I wouldn’t hold my breath. As Sam said, we have to look at the ecosystem, and of course it’s the responsibility of government but it can’t be just that. We’re not like France and will never value culture like we should, so we have to talk about the economic argument. More people go to the theatre than to a football match, and it’s a huge part of who we are and what we do. Even if you were just being a hard-nosed Tory about it, it makes an absolutely huge amount of money.You have said that regional theatre is the\u0026nbsplifeblood of the industry\u0026nbspand also backed a\u0026nbspcampaign\u0026nbspto save King’s Head theatre, a fringe venue in London. What is your biggest worry for the future of theatre?Without hyperbolising, this is not the plague, and anyway the plague didn’t destroy the concept of theatre, nor will this, but a lot of the infrastructure and ecosystem is being smashed. Theatre will return, but a lot of old friends and institutions will fall, and that feels upsetting and soul-destroying. We will get past this, but what we need to do now is save as much as we can with financial and spiritual support.\u0026nbsp• The Madness of George III streams on YouTube\u0026nbspfrom 7pm on 11 June as part of\u0026nbspNational Theatre at Home available until 18 June.\u0026nbspHow to make a donation to the National Theatre.\u0026nbspHow to make a donation to Nottingham Playhouse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929b93311af639a2a7fcbd145303b1dcb99d63e5/0_264_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ac99bcb994b349404cdd0254da440b23","title":"netflix pulls the mighty boosh and the league of gentlemen over blackface","story":"Critics call removal of shows from streaming service ‘arbitrary gesture’ that does little to combat racism The Mighty Boosh and\u0026nbspThe League of Gentleman\u0026nbsphave been removed from Netflix because of their use of blackface, with critics calling the move an “arbitrary gesture” that does little to combat racism.The League of Gentleman’s three series and specials are still on BBC iPlayer and the broadcaster confirmed there were no plans to remove it from the streaming service.The Mighty Boosh’s\u0026nbspSpirit of Jazz and\u0026nbspThe League of Gentleman’s\u0026nbspPapa Lazarou\u0026nbspcharacters were both played by white actors wearing blackface, and the  understands they were seen as problematic by Netflix.Papa Lazarou – described as a “blacked-up ringmaster who calls everybody Dave” – was inspired by an old landlord of the show’s creators, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. The character was accused of harking back to the “ugly legacy of minstrelsy” but Shearsmith has always denied the character was supposed to be a black man.The Spirit of Jazz character is supposed to be the ghost of fictional jazz musician Howlin’ Jimmy Jefferson and was played by Noel Fielding in the series.The comedian Jack Carroll tweeted that the decision to remove the comedy was a way for Netflix to avoid any “real work” to counteract racism. “It’s an arbitrary gesture that means they don’t have to put any real work into combatting actual instances of racial discrimination and comedy history is getting smashed in the process. Glad I kept hold of my DVD’s,” he tweeted.On Tuesday, Little Britain was removed from Netflix, BritBox and BBC iPlayer due to concerns about the use of blackface by stars, David Walliams and Matt Lucas. The comedy sketch show, which first aired in 2003 on BBC Three, has been removed along with the pair’s follow-up, Come Fly With Me.The latest removals, taking place as the Black Lives Matter protests continue, have started a debate about the kind of TV shows and films that cross a line with their depictions of race.The recently launched service HBO Max has removed\u0026nbspGone With the Wind\u0026nbspafter criticism of the American civil war romance epic’s positive depiction of slavery, but confirmed it will eventually return to the service with a “discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions”.Cops – the reality show, which showed police car chases, arrests and violent apprehensions – was cancelled by the Paramount Network after 32 seasons. The civil rights group Color of Change applauded the decision, saying Cops and shows like it played a “significant role in advancing distorted representations of crime, justice, race and gender within culture”.Channel 4 removed Bo Selecta from its All4 streaming service after white comedian Leigh Francis, who starred on the show doing impressions of black celebrities including Craig David and Trisha Goddard, apologised for using blackface.Deadline reported that Netflix has removed four shows from its services in Australia and New Zealand, which starred Australian comedian\u0026nbspChris Lilley, who regularly performed in brownface.At present, BBC iPlayer has Lilley’s Summer Heights High and\u0026nbspWe Can Be Heroes on its service, but two other shows that have been accused of containing racist portrayals (Angry Boys and\u0026nbspJonah From Tonga) are listed as not available.The debate about racist or problematic films and TV shows being on streaming platforms isn’t new.In April 2019, it was reported that Disney would not be including Song of the South on its streaming service Disney+. The film has long been criticised for its depiction of life on a plantation as idyllic, and it grossed $65m at the US box office in 1946, but was never released on DVD in the country.

After a tabloid kiss-and-tell goes nuclear, we witness his life unravel in real time and on social media. Billy is anchored by the only two people he is vulnerable with: his doting, fame-averse mum (Amanda Abbington) and his fellow contestantformer flame (Emma Rigby), who has carved out a success by being real and relatable. It’s a blunt comment on the impact reality TV can have on contestants and families.\u0026nbspIt’s an intense watch. Yates’s commitment to covering every base – money issues, relationships, mental health, grief, suicide, fans, fame, influencers, drug use, agents, masculinity – makes for an aptly claustrophobic watch, topped with the incessant notifications, which “ding!” at every level of Billy’s descent. It will exhaust you into checking your own misconceptions.Conversations around the suicides of two Love Island contestants – and Flack, the show’s presenter, in February – tend to attribute some responsibility to the show’s producers and social-media bullying. However, Yates doesn’t think it’s that simple. As in his documentaries, he is keen not to lay blame at any one door. “Pointing the finger is irresponsible,” he says. By choosing not attribute blame, Yates believes that Make Me Famous “does something healthy. It helps you understand that the pressures on the central character aren’t from any one place.”\u0026nbspWhen I speak to Brittney, by phone, he’s funny, sincere and just the right amount of self-deprecating. Lockdown has him sussing out yoga and making “corona cooking” tutorials to entertain himself. His usual gig is playing Grantchester’s motorbike-riding, crime-busting hot vicar on ITV, with previous stints on time-bending Outlander and the dating-show satire UnREAL. This summer, he will star alongside Tom Hanks in the war epic Greyhound. But long before he was gleaning wisdom from Hollywood A-listers, he was taking tips from his first drama teacher – his mum.But reality TV can be pretty Shakespearean in its storylines – there’s conflict, heartbreak and things often aren’t as they appear. This role should make his alma mater proud.\u0026nbspSome of the most complex scenes are flashbacks to auditions with the show’s producers, played by Line of Duty’s Aiysha Hart and Killing Eve’s Nina Sosanya. They attempt due diligence, trying to probe Billy’s personal life. We never get to see the show at the centre of Make Me Famous, so we’re left to make assumptions about how it all played out. Did Billy embrace the role he was put in or was he manipulated into it? It’s murky. Hart, who plays the ambitious producer Kelly, admits she admires her character’s drive. “She genuinely believes the show could make him a success story,” she says. “At the same time, she considers him ‘producible’.”While reality TV can hold a magnifying glass to our behaviour and has prompted important discussions on racism, gaslighting and body dysmorphia, we have all read the exposés on how the shows are made, how the “talent” is manipulated. It’s easy to forget that one hour of “reality” exists alongside 23 hours that we don’t see. Billy’s story aims to pull back the curtain. Hart is hoping that doing so can spark compassion for the “vulnerability of human beings” and help us “remember that we all have fears, families and issues”.At 36, and 28 years into his career, Yates feels like the wise uncle. Where does he see the current reality frenzy going? “I don’t think we’ll know for maybe another five or 10 years how much this is affecting, not just the people that are going through the experience, but the audience. Lots of young and impressionable people watch these types of shows. There has to be an effect.”• BBC Three’s Make Me Famous will be available to stream on BBC iPlayer from Wednesday 17 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20b7ade6f88f16a0992c481c126a2acb74b8fb9a/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=823756849201a32654fa91b9578d345e","title":"new mexico fracking navajo indian country","story":"Expansion of drilling in New Mexico would threaten sacred artefacts and bring public health risks to area still reeling from Covid-19 Families living in rural areas south-west of Counselor, New Mexico, were telling him they saw sickly bull snakes and near-death rattlers above ground during the snowy, winter months of the south. Sage, the administrator at the Counselor Chapter House, a Navajo local government center, was incredulous.“In February? There’s no snakes in February,” he said.Sage had a theory for what was happening: underground vibrations from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, forced the snakes from their dens and on to the surface.\u0026nbspOver the years, he’s noticed other changes. Vegetation died off and the climate became drier. People living in homes with dirt floors told him they had felt vibrations from the ground late at night, from 2 to 4am.The Navajo and Puebloan lands of north-western New Mexico where Counselor is located are no stranger to drilling. The first oil well in the area was reportedly drilled in 1911 with natural gas following soon after.\u0026nbspToday, the US Bureau of Land Management is considering a plan, known as the Mancos-Gallup Amendment, which could lease land in the region for some 3,000 new wells – many of which would be for fracking oil and gas. The plan would expand drilling into some of northern New Mexico’s last available public lands, threatening the desecration of sacred Native artefacts near Chaco Canyon while bringing in a swath of new public health risks to a place that’s already reeling from one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the world.\u0026nbspUnder the Trump administration, the amount of US lands up for lease to oil and gas companies has soared – 461m acres across the country, as of earlier this year. To New Mexico environmentalists and indigenous activists, the new plan is just another instance of the administration’s energy dominance agenda threatening some of the country’s most pristine lands.\u0026nbspThe new proposal would encroach further upon the Chaco culture national historical park – a network of historic archaeological sites that today hold Unesco world heritage status and are of spiritual importance to Navajo and Puebloan people in the region.Chaco park and other parts of the canyon are protected from drilling through a congressional funding bill. But there are some 250 outlying sites spread throughout north-west New Mexico, said Michelle Turner, an archaeologist studying the region. Many of those sites are connected by ancient roads, she said, which are gradually being erased by drilling-related development.Native people have been living in Chaco Canyon for hundreds – if not thousands – of years, long before the construction of the recognizable Chacoan great houses starting in the mid-ninth century, Turner said. Archaeologists and researchers have been studying the region for 150 years, but “we’re just barely beginning to understand what was going on there,” she added.Turner said researchers don’t fully understand fracking’s potential for archaeological wreckage. However, fracking requires pumping sand, water and chemicals deep underground and then horizontally, breaking through rock formations to release oil or gas, making it more destructive than traditional, vertical wells.Archaeologists estimate there are Native artefacts throughout much of the 7,500-sq-mile San Juan Basin, some of them probably buried underground and at risk from drilling. Julia Bernal said the sites are more than historic artefacts.\u0026nbspThose like Sage, who have spent their life on the lands where fracking has become widespread, point at everyday health and security risks that come with having drilling operations nearby.The spectre of drilling’s dangers became real in 2016 when oil tanks owned by WPX Energy exploded near Nageezi, New Mexico, causing a huge fire that burned for days.\u0026nbsp“It sounded like a pop and then a whoosh, like gas going into a hot air balloon,” Nageezi resident Ida Begay told the Navajo Times. “These explosions shook the air.”Begay and more than 50 others were evacuated from their homes in the incident, which weighs heavily on the minds of many in the region today.\u0026nbspSome residents have complained of headaches and other health issues, caused by breathing in methane.\u0026nbspMario Atencio, a Navajo organizer, said he was overcome by headaches when visiting an orphaned well by his grandma’s land near Counselor last year.\u0026nbspBelow Atencio’s grandma’s land and much of north-west New Mexico sits the San Juan Basin, a 75m-year-old geological formation that is a major natural gas and oil field.\u0026nbspAbove the basin and throughout the Four Corners region is a vast cloud of methane – “the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States”, according to a 2016 Nasa study.\u0026nbspBurning off the excess from natural gas wells, or flaring, is the primary cause of this pollution. But the gas also leaks from abandoned wells like the one on Atencio’s grandma’s land. Breathing in methane can cause headaches has been linked to health issues, including neurodevelopmental effects on children.Atencio, who works with the environmental group Diné Care and is an adviser for Daniel Tso, a Navajo Nation council member, said the Bureau of Land Management is often unclear about the health and environmental risks of drilling.\u0026nbspAtencio said that when BLM representatives approach people about getting consent to lease their land for drilling, many residents walk away believing it’s going to be an older type of vertical drilling, “like the Beverly Hillbillies”. The assumption is that if they sign the agreement, their land will produce oil safely and they’ll get a big check, he said.It seemed as if BLM authorities try swaying Native people to favor drilling, leaving out certain facts, Atencio said. “That by the very definition is environmental racism and environmental injustice,” he added.\u0026nbspIn a statement, Jillian Aragon, a BLM spokesperson, said the agency was developing the Mancos-Gallup Amendment “in coordination with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to ensure the proper fulfillment of our obligations to Tribal communities”, adding that tribes, Pueblos and others’ comments will inform the final document.As more residents learn about the risks from fracking – from the air pollution to the disturbances to wildlife and Native artefacts – opposition to expanding drilling has grown, Atencio said, and the oil and gas checks aren’t as important as they once seemed.“We’re not worried about your money. That ship has sailed,” he said. “We’re worried about the health impacts coming out of these wells.”Covid-19 is making health concerns more prescient. The Navajo Nation and surrounding areas have some of the highest per-capita infection rates in the world.\u0026nbspEnvironmental organizers are concerned that air pollution in the region will exacerbate the death toll, pointing to a recent Harvard study showing that people living in areas with higher pollution have a significantly higher death rate.\u0026nbspThe coronavirus has slowed the Mancos-Gallup Amendment’s path forward by a few months, at least. After the pandemic began, Native organizers pleaded with BLM for weeks to extend a public comment period. Many weren’t able to attend the Zoom hearings due to the spotty or nonexistent internet service around the Greater Chaco region.\u0026nbspJust before the deadline, BLM listened, and pushed the comment deadline to late September, a 120-day extension.\u0026nbspStill, for many in this part of Indian Country, the extension isn’t enough: the Mancos-Gallup Amendment and drilling ever-nearer to Chaco is too much.Sage believes that the Trump administration and its BLM are forcing through the amendment as part of their energy dominance agenda, regardless of their risks.\u0026nbsp“They’re gonna kill us for their own greed,” Sage said.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9389da9d4c95aefd3eb6b377d8360e26b10e7c7a/125_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e1a0c068d6ef55ce3e9f46be411a04","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some resolutions for the future, we want to hear from youLiving in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life.

The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a review of all statues in London, while Labour councils across the country committed to similar studies in their areas.Meanwhile, more than 1,000 protesters in Oxford renewed a prominent 2016 campaign for the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a 19th-century businessman and politician who supported apartheid-style measures in southern Africa, from Oriel College – and drew the support of the local council leader.With petitions and social media campaigns proliferating, activists put together a website, Topple the Racists, compiling more than 60 of the proposed removals. They range from acknowledged slave traders such as Elihu Yale to more controversial inclusions such as Robert Peel, viewed as the founder of modern policing in Britain.Dr Philip Ward-Jackson, a historian of public sculpture and former Conway librarian at the Courtauld Institute, says that he was not aware of a previous period where the UK’s statuary had been under such scrutiny. “In Britain we have kept everything regardless of whether we approve of it,” he says. “Things have come down occasionally, but by and large unless it was because they were in such awful condition they have tended to remain.”The list below details some of the historical figures commemorated through statues, street names and public buildings now under debate.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign – which launched the debate over memorialising figures with links to slavery in 2016 – was reignited in Oxford this week when activists again demanded the removal of a statue at the university’s Oriel College. Rhodes, a leading colonial businessman and politician, was responsible for apartheid policies in southern Africa. He was also co-founder of the De Beers mining company and firmly believed in the superiority of the English over other nations. His defenders have pointed to the establishment in his will of the Rhodes scholarships – whose alumni include former US president Bill Clinton and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull – at Oxford.The Oxford campaign now has the backing of the local council, while Oriel College says that it “continues to debate and discuss the issues”. A campaign group has also formed in Bishop’s Stortford, gaining thousands of signatures for petitions calling for the Rhodes Art Complex and Rhodes Avenue to be renamed.Drake, the famed Elizabethan explorer, and a vice admiral in the fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada, was also a slave trader, making three voyages\u0026nbspto Guinea and Sierra Leone that enslaved between 1,200 and 1,400 Africans between 1562 and 1567 – a figure that probably meant the deaths of around three times as many, according to contemporary estimates.A petition calling for the removal of statues in his honour in Tavistock and Plymouth, and demanding that schools better reflect his role in the slave trade, has gained more than 1,400 signatures. The local councils have stopped short of agreeing that the statues should be removed but both issued statements acknowledging “the great wrongs of the past”. Plymouth’s council leader, Tudor Evans, promised to ensure the monument was accompanied by information about Drake’s role in the slave trade.Described by historian William Dalrymple as an “unstable sociopath”, Clive of India was the first British governor of Bengal. Widely viewed as one of the key figures in Britain’s exertion of control over India, his tenure in Bengal was tainted by corruption, and critics say his policies led to mass famine – killing around 10 million – even as he extracted huge taxes that made him a fortune.He is memorialised with statues in Shrewsbury and London. A petition calling for the removal of the Shrewsbury statue has attracted more than 7,000 signatures, prompting the council to say it will discuss the issue. The London monument will fall under the terms of a review of the city’s statuary ordered by the mayor.Widely regarded as the founding father of modern policing, Robert Peel is memorialised in statues all over the UK, including Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Bradford, Tamworth, Preston, Bury and Glasgow. Some campaigners have called for the removal of statues on that basis, with the Topple the Racists site arguing that he “created the modern concept of policing, which has disproportionately targeted the poor and ethnic minorities world-wide for centuries” – even as others say that his ‘policing by consent’ model should not be linked to current anger at police.Other demands have confused Peel with his father of the same name, who opposed the abolition of the slave trade. Some councils have promised to review the issue while others have pointed to that confusion and suggested that no change is needed.Buller was memorialised in a 1905 statue in Exeter because of stunning successes as a military leader during the Second Boer War. But he also suffered stinging defeats, leading to the nickname ‘Reverse Buller’ and prompting one caustic verdict: “An admirable captain, an adequate major, a barely satisfactory colonel and a disastrous general.” Disputed allegations that he played a part in the use of concentration camps have led to his statue being vandalised, with the local council leader now backing a review.Picton, a 19th-century slaveowner, was remembered in the UK for his military successes before his death at the battle of Waterloo. But he was branded “the Tyrant of Trinidad” because of his brutal policies as governor of the island, where he made vast sums from the slave trade. He also admitted to ordering the illegal torture of a 14-year-old girl, but his conviction was overturned.His statue now looks likely to be removed from City Hall in Cardiff after the council leader agreed with the lord mayor’s request to remove it as it was an “affront” to black people. Another monument in Carmarthen is the subject of a petition with more than 1,000 names. The council leader, Emlyn Dole, has promised a council debate and subsequent decision.Dundas, the first Viscount Melville, is memorialised at the 45 metre (150ft) Melville Monument in Edinburgh, as well as in street names and public buildings in the city. He was a prominent Scottish politician, holding roles including home secretary and war secretary. But even at the time of its creation in 1821, the statue was described in the Scotsman as a “monument to servility”. And it is now widely accepted that as home secretary Dundas played a key role in delaying the abolition of slavery by around 15 years – keeping 630,000 people in servitude.Campaigners have graffitied the monument and signage on Dundas Street, while a statue of his son Robert Dundas was also defaced. The council has already agreed to put a plaque on the base of the Melville Monument noting his role in the slave trade. But more than 6,000 people view that step as inadequate and have called for the statue to be removed as well as streets named in his honour, and former RBS headquarters Dundas House, to be renamed.A founder of Guy’s hospital in south London, he made his fortune through owning a large number of shares in the South Sea Company, whose main purpose was to sell slaves to the Spanish colonies.A statue to Guy stands by the hospital and is owned by the hospital’s charitable arm. Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust ruled out any renaming but said it would discuss the sculpture’s future as part of Khan’s review, adding: “We recognise and understand the anger felt by the black community, and are fully committed to playing our part in ending racism, discrimination and inequality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cab086446e3ecdeb53dcb5e170726a18fd1d93a/0_174_540_324/master/540.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a68ccc925171f71dd3c81d6f2a1c5edd","title":"california coronavirus cases spikes latest","story":"New diagnoses are up partly due to more available testing, but loosening of restrictions and flouting of public health rules are also factorsNine California counties are reporting a spike in new coronavirus cases or hospitalizations of confirmed cases, raising fears that authorities may have to reimpose or tighten public health restrictions aimed at slowing the virus’s spread.New diagnoses in the heavily populated Los Angeles area are going up in part because testing is more widely available. But officials say infections and hospitalizations in most other parts of the state are being driven by factors tied directly to the loosening of restrictions or overt flouting of public health rules. It is too soon to see whether cases will also spike after protests over the death of George Floyd swept the state.In Sacramento county, which had 33 hospitalizations of Covid-19 patients and 14 in its intensive care units as of Tuesday, health officials said the rise in infections is tied to recent gatherings, including birthday parties and a funeral.“Many of the cases that are showing up in hospitals are linked to gatherings that are taking place in homes – birthday parties and funerals,” said Olivia Kasirye, public health director of Sacramento county.One cluster in the state capital region was caused by a single traveler: “Someone traveled from another state and came to visit relatives, and then they all started falling sick,” Kasirye said.In Fresno county, there is “elevated disease transmission” in skilled nursing facilities, the state said. Imperial county is seeing more cases as US citizens cross the Mexican border seeking healthcare. San Bernardino is seeing a spike after gatherings for May holidays and outbreaks at prisons, jails and some skilled nursing facilities.The state is also watching San Joaquin, Tulare and Santa Clara counties for increases in cases or hospitalizations.California has had 133,489 total confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 4,697 deaths linked to it since the beginning of the pandemic.

A pregnant woman from London told how she developed a urinary tract infection after being unable to find a toilet on a trip to Hyde Park. For those with health conditions and disabilities that bring continence problems, the situation is even worse: some describe themselves as essentially housebound. Key workers and volunteers making lengthy round trips to deliver essentials are likewise affected.As some public facilities start to reopen, a chaotic picture emerges with local officials struggling to balance exponential demand with public safety and without clear guidance from government. Public facilities have been badly neglected or shut in recent decades, and the remaining network is under huge pressure to quickly adapt often older buildings that are not easy to modify for distancing requirements or new technology like sensor taps.While Scotland’s national parks have called for urgent guidance on reopening public toilets safely and consistently, local councillors for beaches and beauty spots across England have expressed frustration at Boris Johnson for encouraging people to drive significant distances, but not providing specific guidelines on reopening toilets or support to upgrade to ensure safety of residents and visitors.We are\u0026nbspdesperate\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspadvice\u0026nbspand assistance. Our local toilets are used by up to\u0026nbsp350,000\u0026nbspvisitors each year, but there’s been very little information from larger councils or government apart from ‘wash your hands’.We’ve had an influx of visitors but there\u0026nbspare so many difficulties that for now we only have plans to open the disabled toilets as these are inidual cubicles.\u0026nbspWe’re really worried\u0026nbspthat public\u0026nbsptoilets could be a very serious problem\u0026nbspthat will spread the\u0026nbspcovid virus\u0026nbsparound again.There are funding problems but the main thing is health and safety.\u0026nbspCubicles need\u0026nbspto be\u0026nbspcleaned, potentially after every visit, which means the toilets\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspclosed for 15 minutes every time somebody leaves.\u0026nbspHand-dryers have to remain off because if someone doesn’t wash properly\u0026nbspthey\u0026nbspcan spray infected water everywhere.\u0026nbspThere’s no way we’re going to satisfy the millions who come in August, especially if more people are staying in the UK for their summer holidays.I live by the shore, a heavily populated area with lots of pubs and bars. Some are now operating as ‘takeaways’, selling draught beer in large four-pint milk jugs and attracting large numbers of customers on sunny days.Fair enough, but none of these establishments are able to open their bathroom facilities, and with no public toilets open anywhere nearby, people are relieving themselves down the quiet residential side streets, including the street where I live. In just one hour on Saturday evening, I counted over 25 men pee against the side of my house.I feel conflicted, as I am glad these smaller local businesses have been able to find a way to continue functioning during this tricky time, but this is deeply unpleasant. With pubs potentially not reopening indoor spaces until later, it could be a long hot stinking summer.I do feel the loo lockdown is discriminatory. I understand why they have done it, but throughout lockdown the needs of disabled people have been overlooked and ignored.The assumption now seems to be that people going out to beaches and parks will be able-bodied and continent. I enjoy visiting the coastline and country, but I have continence issues and public loos are are still closed in Wirral, so there’s no chance for me of anything but a brief five-minute look at the sea. I have a radar key but that’s useless if disabled toilets are bolted.Access to toilets, including standard ones - is generally awful, but lockdown has made going out impossible. I think there is a perception that ‘not being able to hold it’ is infant-like and pathetic, rather than a serious need. So it isn’t taken seriously by people who’ve never had to plan their day around where the toilets are.I’ve had to use the bushes and hidden corners, which is really embarrassing. Holding it in is also physically painful and not good for your urinary tract, but I’ve had to suffer for hours, since there aren’t many places you can squat in privacy in the city.In some parks, certain bushes end up as designated loos with a queue to use them. It’s depressing – they are littered with discarded tissues and nowhere to wash your hands, which feels really strange given all the advice.I live in a small flat with no garden, so I need to be outdoors to keep my sanity. When I go outside I basically have to purposefully dehydrate myself, which feels awful and is not healthy, especially on sunny days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a20e071767c0c17df7e6eaa01cf6862fbd441c/0_376_5219_3132/master/5219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c23bb23e4d3c710dfe9de369ff6af7fd","title":"eu says china behind huge wave covid 19 disinformation campaign","story":"Brussels shifts position by accusing Beijing for first time of running false campaignsChina has been accused by Brussels of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a “huge wave” of false facts about the coronavirus pandemic.\u0026nbspThe European commission said Russia and China were running “targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally”. While the charge against Russia has been levelled on many occasions, this is the first time the EU executive has publicly named China as a source of disinformation.\u0026nbspFrench politicians were furious when a Chinese embassy website claimed in mid-April, at the height of Europe’s pandemic, that care workers had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The unnamed Chinese diplomat also claimed falsely that 80 French lawmakers had used a racist slur against the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“I believe if we have evidence we should not shy away from naming and shaming,” Vĕra Jourová, a European commission vice-president, told reporters.\u0026nbsp“What we also witnessed is a surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis, for example the claim there are secret US biological laboratories on former Soviet republics has been spread by both pro-Kremlin outlets, as well as Chinese officials and state media.”“I strongly believe that a geopolitically strong EU can only materialise if we are assertive,” Jourová said, alluding to the aim of the European commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, for the body to have more clout on the world stage.The more assertive stance marks a change in tone from a report in March which merely described Chinese media narratives, while focusing the spotlight on disinformation from Kremlin-backed sources. It comes after lawmakers in the European parliament accused the commission of watering down an earlier report on disinformation under pressure from China – charges EU officials strongly denied.\u0026nbspEU member states are grappling with how to deal with China on a range of fronts, from foreign policy and security, to the economy. The commission described China as a “systemic rival” in a 2019 report that was seen by many member states as marking a watershed in how the EU deals with an increasingly aggressive government in Beijing.The commission has encouraged social media companies to sign a voluntary code of practice on disinformation, while threatening regulation if they fail to act. The latest report steps up demands on platforms to be more transparent in sharing data with researchers and intensify work with independent fact checkers.\u0026nbsp“I would not like the platforms themselves to be the arbiters of truth,” Jourová said.The Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has become the latest company to sign the code of practice, the commission said, joining the likes of Facebook, Google, Twitter and

bubble plan lets single parents in england combine households","story":"Boris Johnson announces easing of restrictions for single parents and people living aloneAbout 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a “support bubble” in England, Boris Johnson has said.The prime minister announced the new easing of social restrictions at his daily press conference in a move to alleviate loneliness among adults struggling on their own.The guidelines will apply from midnight on Saturday, meaning some grandparents will be able to hug their grandchildren for the first time and some couples can be reunited.The new rules will mean single parents and children under 18 that they live with, as well as single adults living alone, can go inside one other household and even stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing.A single-person household will be able to join together with a multi-person household, so a lone parent could, for example, visit their children’s grandparents in another part of England for help and stay for an extended period.It will also mean a couple who live apart can be together for the first time during the lockdown, if at least one of them lives alone.However, any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, so it would mean hard choices for a group of people living together with partners who live alone elsewhere.It will also not apply to people told to shield, who are meant to be isolating until the end of June apart from being able to meet one other person outside their home.If any member of the support bubble developed coronavirus symptoms, all the members would have to follow the normal advice on household isolation.Explaining the new rules, Johnson said: “We are making this change to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbspthose who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures.\u0026nbsp“It’s a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes, because that remains against the law.”\u0026nbspThere were 8.2 million people living alone last year and 2.9 million lone parent\u0026nbsphouseholds, according to the Office for National Statistics.“We would want to make sure that people who have been\u0026nbspsuffering from loneliness, and have been unable to see their families for a long\u0026nbsptime, the rest of their families, are able to do that,” Johnson added.The news is likely to be met with relief from people who live alone but frustration among others who will still not be able to meet loved ones unless physically distancing outside in groups of up to six.Officials admitted the measure was not going to benefit everyone but was targeted at those who had been left isolated by the lockdown restrictions.\u0026nbspThe government has been criticised for prioritising the reopening of the economy, including zoos, shops and outdoor cinemas, above people’s social contact with their families and the full return of schools.However, ministers and the scientific advisers have stressed that the biggest risk of transmission is within households rather than distanced workplaces, so they have been acting with caution to ease restrictions on families meeting each other.One exemption to the exclusivity rule will be that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households, so the children of separated parents could potentially be in two separate support bubbles – one bubble for each parent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf/355_12_2268_1361/master/2268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22def6c67f64a81bd1d8c128d448934","title":"surgisphere sapan desai lancet study hydroxychloroquine mass audit scientific papers","story":"Questions continue for Surgisphere and CEO Sapan Desai as universities deny knowledge of links to firm behind Lancet’s now-disputed blockbuster study Dozens of scientific papers co-authored by the chief executive of the US tech company behind the Lancet hydroxychloroquine study scandal are now being audited, including one that a\u0026nbspscientific integrity expert\u0026nbspclaims contains images that appear to have been digitally manipulated.The audit follows a  investigation that found the company, Surgisphere, used suspect data in major scientific studies that were published and then retracted by world-leading medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.Further inquiries by the  into Surgisphere and its founder and chief executive, Dr Sapan Desai, have confirmed that:The blockbuster Lancet study based on Surgisphere data led to global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 being halted in May, because it appeared to show the drug increased deaths in Covid-19 patients.The study was retracted after a  investigation and researchers found inconsistencies in its data, which came from a database owned by Surgisphere. Desai was a co-author of the paper.The New England Journal of Medicine also retracted a study with findings based on Surgisphere data and which also listed Desai as a co-author. A third paper involving Surgipshere and Desai, which examined the impact of the drug ivermectin on Covid-19 patients, has been removed from the website SSRN, a repository for scientific papers. can confirm that studies authored by Desai and published before he established the Surgisphere database in 2019 have come under scrutiny by the scientific community and journal editors.Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist specialising in scientific integrity, examined a research paper co-authored by Desai and published in 2005 which formed the basis of his PhD in anatomy and cell biology from the\u0026nbspUniversity of Illinois at Chicago.\u0026nbspThe paper, published in the Journal of Neurophysiology, examined differences in the inner-ear tissue between species of rodents. \u0026nbspIt included a collage of nine images of tissue sections obtained from different species including a mouse, a chinchilla and a tree squirrel.\u0026nbspBik works full time identifying scientific fraud, and researchers around the world send her images for review. After the retraction of the Surgisphere papers she began examining some of Desai’s other work. Bik said when she looked at the tissue images in Desai’s PhD paper, repeated patterns jumped out at her.“They are supposed to be from different rodents, yet the rat and the gerbil images have areas shared between them,” she said. “There is not only copy-pasting within the images, but also between rat cells and gerbil cells, for example.”Bik highlighted her suspicions on PubPeer, a website where scientists can provide feedback on papers.“I cannot think of any other explanation than these images have been digitally manipulated,” she told the . A spokeswoman for the journal told the  the editorial board was “aware of the situation and is reviewing the matter”. Neither Desai nor his supervising author at the University of Illinois at Chicago responded to a request for comment.According to online profiles, Desai, who is now 41, has had an extraordinary and varied career. In 2010 the online encyclopedia Wikipedia flagged his page for deletion after editors raised queries about his accomplishments.“If half of the claims in this article are true, this is indeed an exceptional young man,” one website editor wrote of Desai, who at the time was 31. “However, exceptional does not necessarily equal\u0026nbspnotable. Most claims are unsourced or sourced to the subject’s own websites. Many claims are over the top.”As well as holding at least one PhD, a medical degree and working as a vascular surgeon, Desai has also founded several companies including Surgisphere and a charity. His claims (on the deleted Wikipedia page) of having a second PhD and a Juris Doctor, or law degree, could not be independently verified by the  and Desai did not respond to questions about this.His biography also says he completed his master’s of business administration in healthcare management at Western Governors\u0026nbspUniversity. The university did not respond to requests for confirmation of this MBA. But according to the university archive he gave a speech to a graduation of university students in 2012, telling them: “Nothing that is easy is worthwhile. Because at the end of the struggle is a fountain that never stops, a fountain that showers us with the twin gifts of knowledge and wisdom.”In a video he made for a crowdfunding campaign to support a product he designed, described as a “wearable neural induction device”, Desai said he also held a PhD in neuroscience. The device, which Desai boasted could increase brain function and creativity, never came to fruition.  could find no other record of his having neuroscience qualifications and Desai did not respond to questions about this.Meanwhile Elsevier, a well-known Dutch publishing and analytics company specialising in scientific content, told the  it was “initiating the process to thoroughly re-assess” papers involving Desai.  has contacted several of Desai’s former co-authors and colleagues for comment.’s investigation has also raised questions about other Surgisphere claims. The company’s website previously stated that it was “partnered” with a handful of researchers at leading universities to complete “groundbreaking projects”, including Harvard, the University of Minnesota, Stanford, the University of Utah and the University of Glasgow. Those affiliations were removed from the Surgisphere website on Friday.When asked about collaborations, the universities said they had no formal relationship with Surgisphere.A spokeswoman for the University of Utah said it was not aware of any institutional relationship. One co-author of the Lancet paper, Dr Amit Patel, is listed as being affiliated with the university but a spokeswoman said Patel had been an unpaid adjunct professor and had not held a faculty position since January 2017.\u0026nbspOn Monday Patel announced on Twitter that he had resigned from the university. “I had verbally terminated my affiliation with the University of Utah over a week ago and formally this past Friday,” Patel wrote. “There is a much bigger story for which I still do not have the information.”He said in the tweet he was related to Desai by marriage. But this was “old news”, he said. “Despite this I still do not have the information of what happened at Surgisphere,” he said.Patel did not respond to requests from the  for comment. A university spokeswoman said: “The University of Utah does not comment on the reasons surrounding termination of academic appointments.” Harvard University medical school also said it had “no formal research agreements or partnerships” with Surgisphere, and said the reference on the company’s website could reflect Desai’s collaboration with Dr Mandeep Mehra, an investigator and cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital, which is affiliated with the medical school.Mehra was listed as a corresponding author on the Lancet study, which said: “The corresponding author and co-author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.”In a statement to the  after the retraction of the Lancet study, Mehra said his intentions “have always been to contribute to scientific discussion and to ensure that the practice of medicine is based on the best evidence available”. “During this pandemic, I have felt this even more keenly, and believe that it is imperative to provide timely data that informs both the scientific field and the care of our patients,” he said. Mehra said he understood Surgisphere to be a privately held company that purported to have data from hospitals around the world “that could be leveraged to answer important public health questions I posed in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic”.“Since we do not have the ability to verify the primary data or primary data source, I no longer have confidence in the origination and veracity of the data, nor the findings they have led to,” he said.“It is now clear to me that in my hope to contribute this research during a time of great need, I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions – both directly and indirectly – I am truly sorry.”A spokeswoman for the Lancet said the journal was “reviewing our requirements for data sharing and validation among authors, and data sharing following publication” as a result of the retracted study.The University of Minnesota said it had no record of anyone at the university collaborating with Surgisphere. A spokesman said the university had sought to contact the company for clarification when it discovered it was being promoted on the company’s website but that its outreach had gone unanswered.Both the University of Glasgow and Stanford told the  they were not aware of any relationship with Surgisphere. Australia has contacted Desai numerous times for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f92eef702bc3fc4cb74a4a820a850ab5e7a7cfd/0_179_3210_1927/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f3e69dc3cd01ef4f933b2a13d5a6ff9","title":"uk coronavirus border controls more effective done earlier mps told","story":"Health experts also challenge government’s assessment of impact of imported casesStricter border controls would have been more effective if introduced much earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, public health experts have told MPs, as they also challenged the UK assessment of the impact of imported cases.The home affairs select committee took evidence from experts from Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand on measures taken in their respective countries, all of which adopted stricter approaches to the border than the UK, and much earlier.Since Monday, most people arriving in the UK have been required to quarantine in a nominated address for 14 days, a shift in policy that has provoked a significant response from the aviation and hospitality lobby and raised eyebrows among scientists.While questioning the logic of introducing an enforced quarantine for all arrivals in the UK at this time, the experts all agreed it was not too late to introduce border restrictions and warned that mass overseas tourism this summer was “not a good idea”.Sir David Skegg, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, said: “These border measures would be most effective if they had been done very early.“As with New Zealand, all these cases were imported. This disease did not originate in the UK. It would have been much more effective if you’d done this in February.”New Zealand has been ramping up its border restrictions since 3 February, when measures were put in place in relation to China. It is now closed to all but permanent citizens and residents, all of whom have to quarantine in a hotel under supervision upon arrival. New Zealand attempted self-quarantine but it was flouted.Prof Gabriel Leung, the dean of the Li Ka Shing faculty of medicine at Hong Kong University, said: “If you look around the world, the places that have imposed border restrictions earlier on have tended to come out much better with local outbreaks.”Leung said studies had shown where cases in the UK originated from. “If you had imposed border restrictions earlier on that picture would have looked quite different.”But the experts questioned this calculation.Prof Teo Yik Ying, the dean of Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, said: “In a country like Singapore, essentially all our cases are the result of importations.Asked what they thought about reports giving the impression that Britons were “clamouring” to head overseas this summer on holidays, the experts all urged caution.Ying said summer overseas tourism “does not sound like a good idea”.“If we look at what the current situation in Asia is, for many countries in east Asia the cases are actually very low. Regardless of that, the government are not looking at mass-market travel and tourism.”Leung said: “It would be premature for any kind of mass-market holiday.”All the experts said it was not too late to enforce border controls but they had to play a part alongside physical distancing and test-and-trace systems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2271b427d5b711bb80249b0dfc6a6968c0855491/0_345_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0e614ecd2ec9ecc7a01478856ecc03d7","title":"coronavirus live news who urges pakistan to reimpose lockdown as brazil restores covid 19 data","story":"Asylum applications in Europe fall to lowest level for a decade as borders closed world faces worst food crisis in 50 yearsThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 950 more deaths and 17,376 new cases, taking the official totals in the USA to 112,133 and 1,973,797, respectively.Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak so far today include:France’s death toll has risen by only 23 – well below the average daily increase of 53 seen over the last two weeks – to 29,319.

Yet the government still hasn’t delivered on this, and apparently won’t be able to until September. Ministers can’t even provide figures for the number of people being tested day-to-day.The prime minister needs to be utterly transparent about the barriers to opening schools, the limits to testing capacity and the issues affecting the test, trace and isolate system.

She writes:The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is to be questioned as part of an investigation driven by relatives of coronavirus victims into alleged errors made by authorities at the beginning of the pandemic.Prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, will also question the health minister, Roberto Speranza and the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, over the failure by authorities to quarantine the towns of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro after outbreaks occurred there.The move came after grieving families of Covid-19 victims on Wednesday submitted the first 50 complaints to Bergamo prosecutors as they push for an investigation into possible criminal negligence by authorities.The files were brought together by members of NOI Denunceremo (we will denounce), a Facebook group set up in April.“We haven’t identified culprits in the files but the other day we spoke to the prosecutor and explained that our main objective is to find out the truth,” Luca Fusco, the president of NOI Denunceremo, said. “We’re not interested in convictions, we just want to understand what happened. If we understand what happened we can change a system that made mistakes.” Travel restrictions at the European Union’s external borders should be partially lifted by 1 July, the bloc’s top diplomat has said, according to the Associated Press.Josep Borrell said on Wednesday that the European Commission will discuss a coordinated plan with member nations and “put forward an approach for the gradual and partial lifting of these restrictions as of the 1st of July, with certain third countries.”All but essential travel from outside Europe is restricted until 15 June. Many ministers from the 27-nation EU suggested earlier this month that they wanted this deadline extended until early July.As for the EU’s internal borders, Borrell said the executive commission took note that several countries are in the process of lifting internal border controls imposed to keep out people from other member states.Prince Joachim of Belgium has been fined €10,400 by authorities in Spain after going to a party in Cordoba while the country was under its strict coronavirus lockdown. A scandal erupted after Joachim flew from Brussels to Madrid, then travelled to Cordoba to attend a party with 27 other guests on 26 May, at a time when gatherings were restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. He subsequently tested positive for coronavirus and all guests at the party were forced to quarantine themselves. Joachim’s presence at the party, revealed by Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, caused an uproar in both Spain, which has one of the world’s highest death tolls, and in Belgium, which has one of the highest per capita death tolls. After news of his The Belgian royal family said that Joachim had travelled to Spain for an internship. Since travelling for work was considered essential travel this allowed him to leave the country at a time when borders were closed. On Wednesday, Spanish authorities slapped Joachim with the fine, not over the party but because he did not quarantine after arriving in Madrid, as had been mandatory at the time, Belgian Flemish-language news website De Morgen reports. If he pays within 15 days he will only have to pay half. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the country’s health and interior ministers are to be questioned over their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, reports AFP citing news agencies reported. Prosecutors from Bergamo, the city in the northern Lombardy region worst hit by the virus, have launched a wide-ranging investigation into the health crisis, which has officially killed over 34,000 people in Italy. They are looking in particular at why a red zone was not enforced in February around the towns of Nembro and Alzano, with regional officials and the government blaming each other. The government imposed its first red zone, around the town of Codogno, 24 hours after doctors discovered a patient with the virus. It would go on to shut down 10 other towns, and then large areas of the north before imposing a nationwide lockdown. Conte, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, and the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, would be called on by prosecutors in Rome later Wednesday, according to the Corriere della Sera and the Sole 24 Ore dailies. The team, lead by chief prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota, has already questioned the Lombardy region’s head, Attilio Fontana, and his health minister, Giulio Gallera, who insist it is the role of the national government to decide whether certain areas should be shut. science editor Ian Sample explains how vaccines work, runs through some of the main obstacles to creating one for coronavirus and preparing it for public use, and tells us which scenario he thinks is most realistic in the next 18 months.Poland will open its borders with fellow European Union countries on Saturday and allow international flights from next Tuesday, as the country unfreezes its economy despite an increase in coronavirus cases. Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. However, it has been progressively loosening restictions on public life, with shopping centres, hotels and restaurants all reopening in May. “In some countries...this pandemic is still behaving in a very disturbing way, so for now we limit this decision (opening borders) to European Union countries,” the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Poland has seen a recent rise in infections, mostly centred around coal mines in the south. On Monday a record 599 new cases were reported. As of Wednesday morning Poland, a country of around 38 million people, had reported 27,668 cases of the coronavirus and 1,191 deaths. Austria said on Wednesday it was lifting checks at its border with Italy and ending quarantine requirements for more than 20 European countries as of next Tuesday.The Coachella music festival in the Southern California desert is unlikely to take place this year, entertainment news website Billboard has reported. Earlier in March, Goldenvoice said the music festival had been postponed for six months until October due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Coachella, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, brings half a million fans to an open-air site in Indio, east of Los Angeles, over two weekends and was originally scheduled to take place on 10-12 and 17-19 April.France is likely to suffer 800,000 job losses in coming months, the finance minister has warned, as the economy reels from the effects of lockdown.Bruno Le Maire told a finance committee in parliament: The shock is considerable and calls for massive public policies to support and accompany all those affected. Such measures include the furlough scheme, tax breaks for companies and financial incentives to hire apprentices, he said. The economy will not recover to pre-crisis levels until mid-2022, it said. The country is bracing for its worst recession since World War II. France is planning an outlay of some €45bn to support the sectors most in danger, according to the latest version of a budget presented by the government Wednesday.The government has pledged €15bn alone for the country’s aviation industry, where thousands of jobs are on the line as the coronavirus crisis hammers the travel industry. A disenchanted supporter has confronted the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, outside his official residence, accusing the right-wing populist of “betraying” the country with his response to Covid-19, writes Tom Phillips, the ’s Latin America correspondent, in Rio de Janeiro.The woman challenged Bolsonaro outside the Palácio da Alvorada in ‎Brasília on Wednesday morning, pulling out a poster with Brazil’s official coronavirus death toll written on it: 38,000.“These are not 38,000 statistics. They are 38,000 families that are dying right now. 38,000 people who are crying,” the woman told Bolsonaro.“I voted for you.

Photograph: iStock  Guests on the dance floor at weddings will be told to keep 2 metres apart under new post Covid-19 lockdown rules which will also see the end of mini-bars and self-service buffets in hotels.Guests in spas should also be offered express “stress management” treatments instead of therapies that involve touch, while those using hotel pools may be asked to book time slots in advance.For golfers, the space between tee times will be increased to 15-minute intervals. The guidelines also state that caddie service offered to guests must be suspended unless physical distancing can be adhered to.Restaurateurs are being asked to verbally tell customers what is on the menu while there will be no more sharing plates. Embellishments on drinks such as decorative cocktail umbrellas will have to be “minimised.” Tableside cooking should also be suspended if social distancing guidelines cannot be maintained.For hotel weddings, canapés will have to be served inidually and there will no more shared bowls of vegetables, gravy while condiments such as salt and pepper will be on request.Below are the key changes for hotel weddings, spas, golf and restaurants. Further guidance for pubs intending to operate as restaurants is set to be published in the coming days. The new recommendations are predicated on the current physical distancing guidance of 2 metres but public health officials are examining potentially reducing this to 1metre for the hospitality industry.The plans have been criticised by those in the food and beverage sector with the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland Adrian Cummins saying under the current two metre guidelines around 90 per cent of restaurants will not be able to open on June 29th. If that was reduced to one metre Mr Cummins said that would enable 80 per cent of restaurants to open. On Monday Minister for Health Simon Harris said the National Public Health Emergency Team was re-examining the appropriateness of the two metre social distancing requirement for the hospitality sector. HotelsGuests will be asked to enter the property through doors that are automated or manually operated by an employee where possible. “Reception employees should encourage just one representative of each arriving group to approach the check-in desk while the others adhere to physical distancing measures.”If guests use bell service, “ask them to place their luggage on the ground. The bell service can then commence, after which the bell cart can be cleaned and disinfected.”The guidelines say that it will be the responsibility of supervisors and managers to ensure that guests do not congregate in groups.The guidelines add that buffets should be avoided.“Avoid buffet-style service, where possible. If it is required, maintain physical distancing by avoiding queuing systems and staggering guests’ access to the buffet. Employees must plate up and serve food.”Guidelines on rooms say extra pillows and blankets will be provided only if requested by a guest. Food delivered to the room should be set on a tray or trolley in the hallway and the “guest can then retrieve their own food and drinks.”Mini-bars will be replaced by room service. They “must have all loose product removed and the bar then be locked. Items can be made available upon request from room service.”After a guest has left, the guest linen must be removed in a tied bag. “When linen is removed from a bed and laundered, employees must wear the relevant protective items eg gloves and apron, when separating the linen.”Pens will be removed or replaced after each guest checks out.In bars and function rooms, the amount of seating and stools must be reduced and the capacity of outside smoking areas must be reviewed. Open bar snacks or finger food will be served to inidual guests and not shared by a table. Tableside cooking “must be suspended if physical distancing cannot be adhered to.”Jugs will no longer be available on counters according to the guidelines as those using the counter as a dining facility may not be from the same household.Hotel pools Viewing chairs and seating must be removed completely. The pool area must be pressure washed, cleaned and disinfected each night, the guidelines state. “A designated employee must ensure the maximum pool capacity is not exceeded. Alternatively, guests can book their preferred pool time.”Hotel golf Space between tee times will also be increased to 15-minute intervals. Only one player can travel in a cart unless accompanied by people who are part of the same household. The guidelines also state that guest caddie service offered to guests must be suspended unless physical distancing can be adhered to. Inidual scorecards and pencil sets should also be made be available to players.Hotel spa Instead of close contact treatments the guidelines suggest “alternative express treatments” such as “stress management and options that do not involve touch”. Ultraviolet treatment boxes must be installed to ensure that all grooming equipment has been properly sterilised. Where physical distancing cannot be reasonably practised, therapists must be “provided with appropriate personal protective equipment and safeguards such as screens, training and instruction. Above all, it must be emphasised that gloves are no substitute for good handwashing.”Hotel weddings Even the dance floor will be subjected to social distancing under the guidelines. They also recommend a private room for the drinks reception. Canapés must be in inidual portions. During the meal, salt and pepper shakers, butter dishes will be available only on request. There will also be “no family-style service of food, ie no shared vegetable and gravy dishes.” Wedding afters “must be served directly to each guest fully plated.” Social distancing will have to be maintained on the dance floor. There will be signage on tables and dance floors which must ask guests to respect physical distancing guidelines. Staff will be required to monitor and manage distancing.Restaurants Where food is served buffet-style, all items for guest use must be “inidually wrapped” or be a single serve item. “Common tongs or ladles must not be used and neither must common distribution containers from which guests help themselves.”Restaurants are advised to encourage bookings and give specific time slots for diners.When a group arrives at a restaurant to queue, only one member should be asked do so, the document states. “The others must adhere to physical distancing until the group can be seated.”“The amount of seating and stools must be reduced and guests must order from their seat wherever possible to reduce queues.”Straws must be inidually wrapped and the “embellishment” or decoration of glasses like cocktail umbrellas should be minimised.Fresh glasses will be used for every new drink and when pouring drinks employees must handle glasses by the stem or base.Verbal menus are also being encouraged. The guidelines state that menus must be single use or made of a material that can easily be cleaned. “Electronic menus, phone apps and menu boards are an alternative option. It may be possible to verbally recommend food and drinks to guests. If so, this should be done.”Sharing plates must be served in inidual portions from the kitchen. Self-service buffet and hotplates will have to be “shielded from guests” and only employees must plate up food.Buffet service “must only be provided where physical distancing and other public health advice can be followed. Maintain physical distancing by staggering service and placing 2metre markings on the floor to highlight distance if queuing is unavoidable.” But no self-serve food will be available.Bill tip trays, pens and all other reusable guest contact items “must be cleaned and disinfected after each use or used just once and disposed of.”Every restaurant should have “at least one lead worker representative charged with ensuring that Covid-19 measures are strictly adhered to in their workplace,” the documents state.Restaurants are being urged to implement phased shifts, schedule small teams and keep the same team combinations where possible to limit employee interaction. “This will assist should contact tracing be required.”Restaurant tables, seating and couches in public areas and other physical layouts will have to be arranged to ensure appropriate social distancing is adhered to. Employees will also be reminded to “stay at least 2metre away from guests and other employees whenever possible.”The guideline state that if restaurants cannot ensure that employees stay the recommended distance apart at all times “alternative protective measures must be put in place. For example, install physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards between employees.”Hand sanitiser dispensers, touchless whenever possible, must be placed at all restaurant entrances, at employee entrances and at specific points within the public areas of the restaurant. All hand sanitisers must have a minimum alcohol content of 60 per cent.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275476.1591797845!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in minister criticised for blaming covid 19 lockdown on austerity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConor Murphy said: ‘The reason we had to go into lockdown is because the health service has been under-resourced through austerity cuts for many, many years’. Photograph: PA The North’s health minister Robin Swann has rejected an assertion by Sinn Féin finance minister Conor Murphy that the reason Northern Ireland went into lockdown was because of under-resourcing of Northern Ireland’s health service.Mr Murphy claimed on Wednesday morning that lockdown would not have been necessary in Northern Ireland but for British government austerity.“If we had a very robust health service which was well resourced then it would have been fit to cope with the pandemic,” said Mr Murphy on Wednesday.“The reason we had to go into lockdown, and people should understand this, is because the health service has been under-resourced through austerity cuts for many, many years,” he told BBC Radio Ulster Good Morning Ulster programme.“The fact that we had to go into lockdown is because our health service has suffered from decades of under-investment,” he added. Mr Murphy said the North’s health service was still suffering from “nine years of austerity”.His comments, however, prompted a swift response from health Minister Mr Swann who went on the Nolan programme directly after Good Morning Ulster to rebut Mr Murphy’s claim.Mr Swann, who at the outset of crisis was criticised by Sinn Féin for his handling of the coronavirus response, said he took “exception” to the comments.“We had to go into lockdown because that was how the rest of the world, that was how Europe, was managing Covid-19,” said the minister.“It wasn’t because our health service wasn’t fit to cope no health service was fit to cope with what we saw,” he added.Mr Swann said he agreed with Mr Murphy that the health service was under-resourced but that wasn’t the reason Northern Ireland went into lockdown.“The reason we went into lockdown was how we were going to manage the spread of Covid-19. That was the method that was used across the world,” he said.“That was how every other country across Europe, that’s how the Republic of Ireland, how Korea, how Taiwan – all those good models that are held up to me – managed Covid-19.”Asked about the issue on Wednesday First Minister Arlene Foster said she “did not want to get in a political row”.She did say however that “right across the world everybody went into lockdown for a number of reasons and one of those reasons that was common was the fact that we want to protect our health services”.Ms Foster added: “We have seen the way in which health services in places like Italy and Spain were impacted and the fact they were overwhelmed. We wanted to make sure that we weren’t overwhelmed and I was very pleased to see the way in which we were able to manage the pandemic, and indeed, our health service was not overwhelmed.”“Hence, today’s preposterous claim by Murphy that austerity necessitated lockdown. Next, it will be that every job now lost is down to the wicked Brits,” he said.“Sinn Féin was the chief cheerleader for lockdown, agitating for more and urging anger in response to delay,” said Mr Allister.“Everyone knows lockdown was to stop the spread of the virus - clearly Murphy thinks he knew better than the medical advice his Executive was receiving.“This absurd and ridiculous outburst from the man who boasted of a non-existing PPE (personal protective equipment) order with Dublin, demonstrates the dysfunctionality that continues to hallmark the Executive.”SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole said Mr Murphy’s comments were “baffling, bizarre and inexplicable”.Calling on Mr Murphy to clarify his comments he said, “There is, to my knowledge, no evidence suggesting that the reason for the Covid-19 lockdown is the financing of our health service. Indeed other developed economies which spend a higher proportion of GDP on health services have also entered lockdown to prevent onward transmission of the virus and save lives.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274943.1591726039!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda have used enforcement regulations 302 times figures show","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí on Dublin’s Henry Street as people queue outside shops. Photograph: Nick BradshawGardaí have engaged with members of the public more than one million times since the Covid-19 policing operation began, with enforcement regulations used 302 times, according to data released on Tuesday.Of those, 82 incidents have resulted in charges or summonses being issued, some of which related to multiple suspects. In 12 cases the DPP has directed no charges should be pursued and the remainder of cases were ongoing or under investigation.Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin, added that over the past week 13 new incidents were recorded during which the powers were used against members of the public, around the lowest level since the Garda operation. Since Tuesday, Garda members no longer have the power to take action against people who have travelled too far from their homes without a reasonable excuse.Initially members of the public were allowed to travel 2km, to take exercise, and that increased to 5km before increasing on Monday to 20km and unlimited travel within a person’s home county.However, the Garda power to take action against people who had exceeded those distances from home was set to expire on Tuesday. And while it had previously been extended, in May, it has not been extended further.Gardaí still have the power to enforce other public health regulations relating to Covid-19, including prosecuting people who organise large events.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said there had been “very good compliance with the public health guidelines” since the start of the Garda operation, but he urged people to maintain that. “As we enter phase two, it is important that we all continue to play our part in reducing the spreading of Covid-19 by staying local, not making unnecessary journeys, and maintaining social distancing,” he said.“At the outset of the Covid-19 situation, I said that An Garda Síochána will continue to operate as a community-based policing service with a focus on protecting the vulnerable. This approach will not change during this phase.”ArrestsIn its weekly update about the Covid-19 policing operation, Garda Headquarters on Tuesday said there were 13 new cases in which people were arrested or had details taken pending further action in the week to last Saturday.Of those, six cases occurred during the week to last Saturday while seven predated that week but were officially recorded during it. The level of enforcement was in line with the previous week, when 13 new actions were also recorded.To date in the policing operation there have been 93 incidents during which suspects had spat at or coughed at Garda members, up by five in the week to last Saturday.Mr Harris described the spitting and coughing attacks, though isolated, as “a serious concern” for the Garda, adding spit hoods had now been used on suspects 70 times. The hoods are mesh head coverings which prevent a suspect spitting at gardaí and Mr Harris said they were being used only as “a last resort”.Gardaí have also detected 2,018 other crimes, unrelated to Covid-19 public health regulations, while carrying out the Covid-19 policing operation. These included public order crimes, weapons and drugs offences and a range of motoring crimes, among others.To date, the Garda National Vetting Bureau had vetted 30,403 applicants for Covid-19-related roles and the turnaround time for a vetting application was one day.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275047.1591736699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord fat cats go bats as captains of industry take over the chamber","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDanny McCoy, CEO of Ibec, was appearing before the Covid-19 committee, giving the view from the premium seats, in the premium seat.  Photograph: Alan BetsonChampagne corks popped in corporate corners, fat cats punched the air with pin-striped paws and, in spacious homes with private bars, silver-haired golfing buddies turned towards the TV, raised their glasses and burst into song.“Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, we love you sooooo . . .”Despite the ongoing closure of their clubhouses, the Captains of Industry were in high spirits because while they know they really run the country and pull the strings, now everyone else could see that too. They are the ones in full control.No need to pretend anymore.It was early Tuesday afternoon when it happened. Nobody seemed to notice. Perhaps because it appeared so natural.In the Dáil chamber, in the Taoiseach’s seat, sat a man in a well-cut suit looking very much like he belonged there. Doing the usual, answering questions from TDs. But his name was not Leo Varadkar.It was Danny McCoy, the chief executive of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec).Not so much a takeover as an assertion of the ruling order. (Just in case any of those Greens with their social consciences and “ferment yer own programmes for government” mentality were getting ideas above their station in the excitement of the coalition formation talks.)So there he was. The man from Ibec. Sitting in the seat of ultimate political power in Dáil Éireann. Needless to say there wasn’t a complaint from the Fine Gael benches around him. Nor, for that matter from the Fianna Fáil ranks across the floor.Sure lookit, if you weren’t looking at him you’d only be looking at that Tom Parlon from the Construction Industry Federation.Oh-oh! There go the champagne corks again.Those images on the TV monitor in Leinster House could have spooked some of the new Green TDs and Senators contemplating the political future had they looked up and seen Danny McCoy in full flow in the Dáil at this critical juncture in the government formation talks.But wait. No need for alarm.Danny was merely appearing before the Covid-19 committee, giving the view from the premium seats, in the premium seat.He was gone again in a couple of hours. His industry prefers to operate in less conspicuous parts of Leinster House and Government Buildings.Apparently, Cork socialist Mick Barry fainted in the corridor when he glimpsed the Ibec chief holding forth from the Taoiseach’s chair, while Richard Boyd Barrett was conveyed senseless from the chamber by a team of ushers.But the sight was a thrilling one for our high net worth visionaries.“The last time I felt this happy I was listening to an interview with Pat McDonagh from Supermac’s,” boomed one.Apart from that, the other highlight of a long day in the chamber was from virologist Dr Cillian De Gascun, who magnificently bamboozled the TDs on the origins of Covid-19 and its link to bats.“SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the coronaviridae family,” he told the politicians. “Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural host for the virus, the recombinogenic nature of coronaviruses means it can be difficult to identify the ultimate source because different parts of the genome can have different origins. This is in contrast to influenza viruses, for example, which reassert but do not typically undergo homologous recombination within ribonucleic acid – RNA – segments.”Anyway, it seems that bats are riddled with viruses. The Rhinolophus affinis bat is in the frame for our current pandemic, although we must not forget Malayan pangolins.And, on the subject of bats, there were some very strange reports trickling from the top secret talks between the Greens and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Specific items were down for discussion, but Green negotiator Ossian Smyth wanted to discuss medicinal cannabis and have a commitment in the programme for government that GPs will be able to dispense it to patients.With the clock running out on the time left to form an administration, one hour of the two-hour morning session was sidetracked with this unscheduled discussion on cannabis.“I felt like rolling a spliff myself after the first half hour,” one of the negotiators told a political colleague afterwards.There were mixed signals coming from Agriculture House, which is the building on the Leinster House campus in Kildare Street where the talks are taking place.Talk of two factions now: the Eamon Ryan faction and the Catherine Martin faction. Martin is challenging Ryan for the leadership, an action which activists correctly insist is in accordance with their constitutional rules. But it isn’t mandatory either.It\u0026nbspseems a strange time to launch a leadership tilt when so much is at stake.But nothing much is escaping the talks in terms of leakage. The participants are being very cagey. But there is no sense that this is anywhere near being a done deal. Tuesday’s sessions were being touted as the make-or-break ones. But, yet again, the negotiations drag on.Apart from one session on education, the Dáil has cleared the Wednesday schedule for statements on climate change. All day, starting at 9.30 in the morning and finishing at nine at night. It’ll be scintillating.Meanwhile, the teams will continue their efforts to sign off on a policy paper.Around Leinster House, the mood keeps swinging from pessimistic to mildly optimistic and back again."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Lam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275888.1591812490!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu accuses china and russia of coronavirus disinformation campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChinese officials have openly promoted a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus originated in the United States. Photo illustration: Rafael HenriqueSOPA ImagesLightRocket via GettyThe European Union has accused Russia and China of running large-scale disinformation campaigns targeting EU citizens, resulting in a “huge wave” of false information about the coronavirus pandemic.The spread of the virus has “been accompanied by a massive wave of false or misleading information, including attempts by foreign actors to influence EU citizens and debates”, the European Commission wrote in a report on Wednesday.“Foreign actors and certain third countries, in particular Russia and China, have engaged in targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood and globally,” it stated.It was the first time the EU’s executive body named China as a source of disinformation. In recent months the EU’s diplomatic service has been struggling to deal with an increasingly aggressive Beijing, which it sees as having sought to exploit the pandemic for propaganda purposes.The report also included an indirect criticism of US president Donald Trump, who floated the idea of using bleach as a medical treatment for the disease.“Disinformation in times of the coronavirus can kill,” said EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell. Belgium’s Poison Control Centre had recorded a 15 per cent increase in bleach-related incidents, a commission document noted.The report presented disinformation as a threat both to democracy and the health of citizens. According to one study, the commission noted, willingness to take up a vaccination in Germany decreased by almost a fifth in less than two months amid a blizzard of dubious scare stories.The EU’s diplomatic service recorded more than 550 disinformation narratives from pro-Kremlin sources, and found evidence of a “co-ordinated push” by Chinese sources to promote its response to the pandemic and deflect blame.Conspiracy theoryChinese officials have openly promoted a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus originated in the United States, part of a stand-off with Washington, where Mr Trump has dubbed the disease the “Chinese virus”.Beijing has used sales of medical equipment and aid to bolster its image after being blamed for the spread of the virus due to perceived failures at the time of its outbreak.\u0026nbspIn France the Chinese ambassador was summoned in April due to outrage over posts published on the embassy website claiming elderly people in that country had been abandoned to starve to death and that French parliamentarians had used a slur against the head of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“I believe if we have evidence we should not shy away from naming and shaming,” said Vera Jourová, a European commission vice-president. “What we also witnessed is a surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis. For example the claim there are secret US biological laboratories on former Soviet republics has been spread by both pro-Kremlin outlets, as well as Chinese officials and state media,” she said.The commission has increased pressure on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter to stop the spread of misinformation on their platforms as it begins a public consultation on how to update regulations on internet companies that could make platforms take more responsibilty for content.Google, Twitter and Facebook have already signed up to a code of conduct produced by the commission on disinformation.

Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275427.1591780721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus worst nightmare pandemic far from over says fauci","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dr Anthony Fauci: “Where is it going to end? We’re still at the beginning of it.” Photograph:  Doug MillsThe New York TimesThe US’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, calling Covid-19 his “worst nightmare”.“In a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world,” Dr Fauci said, speaking to executives at a conference of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. “And it isn’t over yet.”About 7 million people have been infected with the coronavirus and 400,000 people are known to have died. Many countries, including the US where more than 110,000 have died, are now relaxing quarantine rules despite rising rates of infection in some areas.“That’s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn’t over yet. And it’s condensed in a very, very small time frame,” said Dr Fauci.In a videotaped discussion Dr Fauci said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but he was surprised by how “rapidly it just took over the planet”. Dr Fauci attributed the rapid spread to the contagiousness of the virus and extensive world travel by infected people.The top White House infectious disease adviser said the coronavirus pandemic differed significantly from other recent public health crises including Ebola and HIV. “I mean, Ebola was scary. But Ebola would never be easily transmitted in a global way,” he said. “HIV, as important as it is, was drawn out over an extended period of time. I mean, I think the ultimate impact of Aids almost certainly will be greater than anything we’re talking about now.”The coronavirus just “took over the planet,” he said.Dr Fauci described research on the disease as “a work in progress” and said there were still questions about whether or not survivors who were seriously ill would fully recover. The disease has been shown to have a wide range of effects on people – leaving some without symptoms while others suffer lung damage, strokes, clotting disorders and severe immune responses.Dr Fauci was speaking after the World Health Organization (WHO) rolled back guidance that it was “very rare” for the disease to be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms.“Oh my goodness,” Dr Fauci said. “Where is it going to end? We’re still at the beginning of it.”But Dr Fauci said he was “very heartened” by the pharmaceutical industry, which he said, “stepped up to the plate”. There are more than 124 Covid-19 vaccines under development as of June 2nd, according to the WHO, and Dr Fauci said he was “almost certain” that more than one would be successful.“The industry is not stupid. They figured it out,” Dr Fauci said. “There’s going to be more than one winner in the vaccine field because we’re going to need vaccines for the entire world. Billions and billions of doses.” – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit has reopened divide within tories cannot bridged","story":"If one issue down the decades has been guaranteed to cause upheavals in the Conservative Party, it is protectionism. The great schism of 1846, following Robert Peel’s repeal of the Corn Laws, kept the Tories out of office for 20 years as free traders and landowning farmers split. In the early 20th century, efforts to secure preferential tariffs for British and Empire agricultural products caused another rift. The UK’s entry into the Common Market in the early 1970s was dominated by arguments over the impact on Commonwealth farmers of the EEC’s trade barriers.Now that we have left the EU and are negotiating trading arrangements with the bloc and other countries, these internal arguments have broken out once more. Cabinet ministers have reportedly been at loggerheads over how to honour election commitments to uphold food production standards in a trade deal with the United States.This has been sold to the country as a determination to keep “chlorinated chicken” off the supermarket shelves, as though the rows and rows of cheap, home-bred poultry, all weighing in at 4lbs 2oz, have been leading the life of Riley before getting the chop. In reality, it is protectionism masquerading as a food standards issue since nothing associated with the US processes will harm anyone. This is about backing British farming against the might of America.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers Union, has gone so far as to warn of an existential threat to the entire industry if it faced unfettered competition from the US, because domestic producers would find it impossible to compete on price.The most annoying thing about this debate is the attempt to pretend it is something else. Ministers fall over themselves to deny it has anything to do with protectionism even as MPs are targeted for failing to “stand up for British farmers”. Why not admit the intent and take the argument from there? Protecting domestic agriculture from cheap imports is hardly new. Free traders must acknowledge that farming is no less vulnerable to competition from outside than steel or coal or shipbuilding, all of which have gone under in the past 30 years.At issue is which is more important: the industry or the consumer? Free traders following the Ricardian principles of comparative advantage maintain that an overall increase in economic welfare is achieved by importing from countries that produce goods more cheaply. But there is no point pretending this does not harm specific sectors. After the Corn Laws were repealed, domestic agriculture went through a period of depression in the late 1800s up until the First World War. Since the Second World War, farming has been shielded first by UK tariffs and then by membership of the Common Agricultural Policy.We left the EU to forge free trade deals with other countries and yet at the first hurdle the old protectionist questions are being asked once more. One battleground is the Agriculture Bill which is to be given a second reading in the House of Lords today. In the Commons a few weeks ago, 20 Tory MPs rebelled by backing an amendment to enshrine in law existing welfare standards. The Government fought it off but it is likely to be revisited in the Upper House, where the Conservatives do not have a majority, and reinserted in the Bill, whereupon it will come back to the Commons. A major celeb-backed campaign is under way to ensure these protections are given statutory force.The Government opposes this but insists it has no intention of watering down animal welfare regulations and will not accept imports from countries that do not observe our standards. Yet that may well scupper a trade deal with the US. Why would Donald Trump, or Joe Biden for that matter, want to sign an agreement that kept American livestock producers out of UK markets while allowing our lamb and beef farmers access to theirs?It’s either free trade or it isn’t. A half-way house, whereby some goods that do not conform to UK regulations are subject to tariffs, is being explored but does not look promising. A leaked letter from No 10 instructing ministers to have “no specific policy” on animal welfare in US trade talks has heightened concern among farmers that a sell-out is on the way.One reason why the proposed US-EU trade deal never materialised was because the Europeans would not allow tariff free access to American chickens which cost 20 per cent less to produce. Farmers say that is because they are kept in dreadful conditions so there is no level playing field. But we also have intensive poultry farming, if not on the same scale. World Trade Organisation rules do not differentiate the methods of production when it comes to trade deals.Moreover, if US chickens are sold here and are properly labelled, no one has to buy them. But price is important for many consumers. Free-range chickens can cost four or five times as much as a broiler sold in a cut-price supermarket. The American birds may be cheaper still. In any case, a deal with the US also opens a huge market for UK farmers whose higher quality and ethical standards will be a marketing advantage in pitching for the custom of better-off Americans.Under the Agriculture Bill, farmers will continue to receive most of the support they were paid under the CAP until 2022 through a series of transition arrangements that will also protect the environment and ensure high production standards. But, they ask, what will be the point of these if they are then left to the mercies of cheap imports from the US and elsewhere? In addition, if there is no UK-EU trade deal by the end of the year, their exports to Europe will become more expensive.Are we really looking at the possible extinction of British agriculture? Aside from the impact on the livelihoods of farmers and the countryside they manage, it would be a serious matter, given how vulnerable this country – which imports 40 per cent of its food – is to a breakdown in supply lines.If the vaunted free trade deal with America looks like foundering over agriculture, which way will Boris Johnson jump? He needs to land this deal, especially as talks with the EU are not going well. But he faces the age-old choice for Tory prime ministers: farmers or consumers? It will be hard to placate both, as Peel discovered.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round malaysia shows can open","story":"Relief for any Malaysians with an unwanted lockdown hairstyle on, as all economic and social activities - including barber shops - resumed after almost three months of restrictions.The country has managed to successfully control the virus, having recorded 117 deaths since March and seen the vast majority of patients recover after becoming infected.As society opens up it\u0027s great news for everyone in need of a trim - even if capacity is a little more limited than usual.Hairdressers in the UK are currently making preparations to open in July.In the meantime can take some tips from the personal protective equipment and social distancing measures on show in Kuala Lumpur. Elsewhere, more than half of the people tested in Italy\u0027s hotspot of Bergamo have antibodies showing that they have come into contact with the virus - suggesting that the population could already be approaching herd immunity.Ben Riley-Smith reports on the gradual reopening of New York, with at least 400,000 people already thought to have returned to work this week, and the city\u0027s leaders saying that it is making its way out the other side following what was one of the worst outbreaks anywhere in the world.And the Fifa football game series has well and truly come into its own in Spain - where top ision La Liga fixtures will use crowd noise from the popular franchise to generate a buzz around Lionel Messi\u0027s socially distanced goals until fans can safely be welcomed back into stadiums.Here\u0027s the rest of today’s good news:A Sikh temple in Queens Village, New York has served more than 145,000 free meals in the space of 10 weeks during the pandemic.

It is an employer who decides whether people are furloughed or not. And until the first of July part of furlough means you are not allowed to work while on furlough.He added: If people are saying people going to parks or beaches or treating it as a holiday are flouting the scheme, that seems to imply that people should be sitting at home cocooning themselves in misery while on furlough. I would argue differently... it is not flouting the furlough scheme to be sitting in a park, to be reading a book, to be taking time off, it is actually the definition of the rules of the furlough scheme which says you cannot work.The Treasury today announced that new parents would be able to benefit from a lengthened time to apply for the furlough scheme.It has been extended until October with extra contributions from employers being introduced.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: When I announced these changes to the furlough scheme last month, I was clear that we wanted to do this in a fair way, that supports people back to work as the country begins to reopen following coronavirus.But for parents returning from leave, their circumstances has meant that they are still in need of support, and I\u0027m pleased that they will be able to receive the financial assistance they and their family will need.Further details of the change will be published on June 12, the Treasury said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london should not european financial hub brexit says michel","story":"London should lose its status as a European centre for financial and legal services after Brexit, Michel Barnier has said. Mr Barnier told representatives of the European Economic and Social Committee that Britain should also not keep its large share of the lucrative market for testing goods to ensure they meet EU standards. European Commission negotiators have turned down repeated British offers for mutual recognition of third party conformity assessments, which would allow UK-based testing laboratories to certify cars, chemicals, marine equipment, organic and pharmaceutical products for export into the EU market. Mr Barnier said that the EU was ready to compromise to break the deadlock and called on the UK to soften its red lines as well.  Mr Barnier said he hoped a June meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, would bring fresh political impetus to the negotiations this month. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates covid 19 infections highly correlated air travel","story":"Austria will have to wait a little longerComment:  It\u0027s time for the Government to be straight with us about our summer holidays Key dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists?

Now a Facebook post has raised the possibility that the ruin will be uncovered in 2021.This Tuscan oddity, which was first submerged in 1946 to build a hydroelectric dam, lured over a million visitors when it last reappeared.Visitors explore the ruined village in 1994The spread of coronavirus cases is highly correlated with the extent of air travel, according to a report.A study by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) named the UK as an example of where a large number of domestic and international flights facilitated contagion. The report said the flow of air passengers across and within country borders has been a major contributor to the spread of the virus.Serge Stroobants, an IEP director, told the PA news agency: The countries most impacted are countries that are really participating in global trade in the globalised world and the interconnected world.These are countries in which you will find a large airport hub, giving the potential to people to travel from one country to the other.That\u0027s why, for example, the region of Milan in Italy, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt, London and New York, those big international hubs created more exchanges and more potential for the virus to grow.The report comes as the UK introduces its controversial two-week quarantine policy for those arriving by air. Critics have describes it as the right move at the wrong time, with the rest of Europe slowly easing border restrictions. The Foreign Office is still advising against non-essential travel, meaning your holiday may not be insured, and a two-week quarantine may be waiting when you get back, but for those willing to book a summer break right now there are some fantastic offers. “There are more than five million seats on offer for flights departing the UK in July alone, so airlines are trying to persuade consumers to fly again as soon as the FCO advice changes, said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy, The PC Agency.The best deals include return flights to Venice in peak season for £30 and all-inclusive five-star holidays in Tenerife for £699. Read the full storyVirgin Limited Edition, a collection of eight hotels (including the private island of Necker), is to reopen the first of its properties at the beginning of July. Son Bunyola Estate, in Mallorca\u0027s Tramuntana mountains, will welcome guests from July 4.

At around 70-80kms (43-50 miles) from Belarus we start driving through country roads to get round the border guards, one driver said, adding it was a 10-12 hour trip from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, costing 10,000 roubles ($146).Milan\u0027s Pinacoteca di Brera art gallery has reopened to the public.

But just how large could the damage of the prolonged school shutdown be?The national return to school is not going to plan.Last month the government said primary school children who have been at home under lockdown should start returning to classrooms from 1 June and that the re-opening of secondary schools could commence from 15 June.However, the re-opening up of primary schools has been much more patchy than expected, with only half of them opening their gates to some new pupils last week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is time to put children’s interests first and reopen schoolsThe plan to reopen schools is equally impractical in SeptemberAnd now ministers are suggesting a return to full normality for education may not now come until after the summer holidays in September.Many parents were compelled by the school closures to look after their children during the daytime when they would otherwise have been working.Some have had to quit their jobs to do so. Others have had to reduce their hours. Many are juggling their formal work with childcare, putting great strain on families and harming their productivity.The delayed re-opening of schools will be a blow to many of those households.But if those parents can’t work, or can’t work at full capacity, even as some sectors of business are being allowed to re-open, it also threatens to be a blow to the wider economy. So how large could the damage of the prolonged school shutdown be?How many workers are affected?But not all these families will be affected equally by the school closures.Some of those parents will have been looking after children full-time already before the lockdown and some will have older children who don’t need as much direct supervision.Samuel Tombs of the economic consultancy Pantheon estimates that the school closures will have created a major childcare problem for around 4 million families and that around 2.5 million workers—7.5 per cent of the UK workforce —will have had to take leave their jobs to look after young children.How does this translate into economic harm?No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIf parents aren’t able to work as much as they otherwise would have because they have to provide more childcare this will likely have hit their income.This reduction in the workforce also negatively impacts the businesses that parents work for, or would otherwise have worked for.At the height of the lockdown the impact of this will have been mitigated because many firms were not operating at full capacity, or perhaps at all.But the damage will likely grow as the wider economy opens up but schools don’t and many parents find themselves unable to return to work.Schools also contribute to UK economic output themselves in the way the GDP figures are compiled (with every pupil in school counted as economic output).Education’s direct contribution to UK GDPSo school closures also have a direct negative impact on GDP.Mr Tombs estimates that a combination of these two factors mean school closures probably reduced GDP by around 8 per cent in April and May.The implication of a longer closure of schools is a longer drag on national output.Mr Tombs estimates that if pupils are still only in school around half of the time in the autumn, GDP will be 4 per cent lower than otherwise - in cash terms that would represent damage of around £7bn a month.Moreover, he warns that such a drag could extinguish hopes of a V-shaped recovery for the UK from the lockdown-induced recession.Are there any longer-term impacts?Experts are increasingly concerned about the negative impact of the school closures on the education of children, particularly those from more disadvantaged households who are less likely to be getting adequate schooling at home.Professor Simon Burgess of the University of Bristol and Professor Anna Vignoles of the University of Cambridge note that younger children particularly benefit from formal schooling.“The earlier years of a child’s life are pivotal for their development, and investment during this time is particularly valuable, in terms of improving their cognitive and non-cognitive skills,” they say.The longer the school shutdown the greater the harm to their development. By September many children will have had no formal schooling for almost six months. Estimated impact of school closures on GDP in April and MayExperts also fear that older children will get worse exam results due to school closures, harming their prospects in the labour market in the future.Modern economies increasingly rely on the “human capital” of their workforces to grow. This reflects a workforce’s skills and capabilities acquired through education.So, from that perspective, there is a clear danger that a longer school shutdown could inflict greater damage on the UK’s long-term economic growth potential.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The OECD forecasts that the global economy will take a 6 per cent hit, by far the biggest drop of any projection in the organisation’s 60-year history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe research, which covers 46 industrialised nations, delivers another warning to Boris Johnson’s government, as ministers announce plans to ease a host of restrictions over the coming weeks.How a green economy could solve the unemployment crisisNon-essential shops are to open on 15 June, the business secretary Alok Sharma confirmed on Tuesday, while pubs and bars are set to welcome customers again from 4 July.The relaxation comes despite Public Health England (PHE) research estimating that there are around 17,000 new cases daily, with infection rates rising in the northwest and southwest.At a national level, PHE estimates that the number of people each person is infecting – the R number – is close to 1, meaning that a small increase in the R number would see case numbers rise again.The Faculty of Public Health expressed its concern last week that too many people still have the virus for the country to return to “something approaching normal life”.“We believe the urgent priority for the UK is to learn from the success of these countries by setting an objective of having no new community cases of Covid-19 as quickly as possible,” Maggie Rae, president of the faculty, wrote in the British Medical Journal.The OECD’s forecasters focused on two “equally probable scenarios” – one in which a second wave of infections, with renewed lockdowns, hits before the end of 2020, and one in which another major outbreak is avoided.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn the latter scenario, they estimate that the UK will see GDP reduced by 11.5 per cent this year, a drop almost three times as large as in 2009 during the wake of the financial crisis.The OECD found that trade, tourism and hospitality, which make up a large part of the UK economy, have been particularly badly impacted by the virus. France and Spain are both expected to see their respective economies shrink by 11.4 per cent with Italy faring marginally better at 11.3 per cent.Germany, which has controlled the pandemic more effectively than many other European countries, is forecast to see its economy contract 6.6 per cent this year.If a second wave of infections hits, forcing countries to bring back some restrictions on people’s freedoms, the OECD expects Spain to experience the worst recession, with its economy contracting by 14.4 per cent compared to 14 per cent for the UK.“The 6 per cent decline in global GDP is larger by far than any we have projected in the 60 years since the OECD was created,” said OECD general secretary Angel Gurria.“Hundreds of millions have become unemployed – and that is in the scenario where no second wave of infections happens.”If a second wave were to hit, global GDP is predicted to shrink by more than 7.5 per cent and around 40 million more people will lose their jobs, he added.He reiterated his warning that to see the pandemic as presenting a choice between lives and livelihoods was a “false dilemma”.“If the virus is not brought under control, there will be no robust economic recovery,” Mr Gurria said.OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said: “Both scenarios are sobering, as economic activity does not and cannot return to normal under these circumstances.“By the end of 2021, the loss of income exceeds that of any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments.”She added: “Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery.“Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while.“Governments can provide the safety nets that allow people and firms to adjust, but cannot uphold private sector activity, employment and wages for a prolonged period.”Responding to the report, Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only country to suffer economic damage.

The travel industry also has some positives after a torrid six months, with one in 10 people admitting they had missed their foreign trips so much they were planning on going away more than they did last year.Of the 2,600 surveyed by OnePoll, 495 identified themselves as managers, directors, or business owners.More than half of this group said they expected their business to come out of the pandemic the same or better than it was last year.  And four in 10 expected their business to come out worse, while 1 per cent feared going bankrupt or being forced to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The OECD forecasts that the global economy will take a 6 per cent hit, by far the biggest drop of any projection in the organisation’s 60-year history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe research, which covers 46 industrialised nations, delivers another warning to Boris Johnson’s government, as ministers announce plans to ease a host of restrictions over the coming weeks.How a green economy could solve the unemployment crisisNon-essential shops are to open on 15 June, the business secretary Alok Sharma confirmed on Tuesday, while pubs and bars are set to welcome customers again from 4 July.The relaxation comes despite Public Health England (PHE) research estimating that there are around 17,000 new cases daily, with infection rates rising in the northwest and southwest.At a national level, PHE estimates that the number of people each person is infecting – the R number – is close to 1, meaning that a small increase in the R number would see case numbers rise again.The Faculty of Public Health expressed its concern last week that too many people still have the virus for the country to return to “something approaching normal life”.“We believe the urgent priority for the UK is to learn from the success of these countries by setting an objective of having no new community cases of Covid-19 as quickly as possible,” Maggie Rae, president of the faculty, wrote in the British Medical Journal.The OECD’s forecasters focused on two “equally probable scenarios” – one in which a second wave of infections, with renewed lockdowns, hits before the end of 2020, and one in which another major outbreak is avoided.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn the latter scenario, they estimate that the UK will see GDP reduced by 11.5 per cent this year, a drop almost three times as large as in 2009 during the wake of the financial crisis.The OECD found that trade, tourism and hospitality, which make up a large part of the UK economy, have been particularly badly impacted by the virus. France and Spain are both expected to see their respective economies shrink by 11.4 per cent with Italy faring marginally better at 11.3 per cent.Germany, which has controlled the pandemic more effectively than many other European countries, is forecast to see its economy contract 6.6 per cent this year.If a second wave of infections hits, forcing countries to bring back some restrictions on people’s freedoms, the OECD expects Spain to experience the worst recession, with its economy contracting by 14.4 per cent compared to 14 per cent for the UK.“The 6 per cent decline in global GDP is larger by far than any we have projected in the 60 years since the OECD was created,” said OECD general secretary Angel Gurria.“Hundreds of millions have become unemployed – and that is in the scenario where no second wave of infections happens.”If a second wave were to hit, global GDP is predicted to shrink by more than 7.5 per cent and around 40 million more people will lose their jobs, he added.He reiterated his warning that to see the pandemic as presenting a choice between lives and livelihoods was a “false dilemma”.“If the virus is not brought under control, there will be no robust economic recovery,” Mr Gurria said.OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said: “Both scenarios are sobering, as economic activity does not and cannot return to normal under these circumstances.“By the end of 2021, the loss of income exceeds that of any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments.”She added: “Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery.“Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while.“Governments can provide the safety nets that allow people and firms to adjust, but cannot uphold private sector activity, employment and wages for a prolonged period.”Responding to the report, Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only country to suffer economic damage. The chancellor said: In common with many other economies around the world, we\u0027re seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy.The unprecedented action we\u0027ve taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

We are trying to work together and make a vaccine available in the fastest possible time.”It was announced this week that Professor Shattock’s team has specifically developed a RNA vaccine, which delivers genetic instructions to the body’s cells to make the “spike” protein seen on the surface of coronavirus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only small quantities of virus are used for gene sequencing and vaccine testing.Asked when his vaccine might be ready, Professor Shattock said: “We hope next year but there is no ­certainty (a) that any inidual vaccine will work and (b) that the data will be robust enough for it to be licensed.“At the moment there is a lot of speculation and we really need to deal with facts and data rather than over-promising and under-delivering.”He said the first vaccines to emerge would be unlikely to offer full protection but may at least reduce the severity of the illness.Professor Shattock’s team is continuing to rely on public funding for its research. Last month, it received a further £18.5m from the government.Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, a vaccine research body, has meanwhile entered into a private-public partnership with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to accelerate the development of its vaccine.The candidate has already passed the initial Phase 1 stage, which verifies its safety, and last month researchers begin recruiting 10,000 people, including adults over 56 and children aged five to 12, for Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the trials.It was also announced last week that AstraZeneca had reached a £586m agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, and the Serum Institute of India to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses of the vaccine, with delivery starting by the end of the year.Separately, Imperial College London has formed a social enterprise called VacEquity Global Health to help develop its vaccine.Imperial and VGH will waive royalties for the UK and low-income countries “and charge only modest cost-plus prices to sustain the enterprise’s work, accelerate global distribution and support new research”, the university said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Twice as many people expected to see a drop in prices than those who thought property in their area would increase in value.However, this could be a positive development for first-time buyers and those looking to climb the property ladder.  The travel industry also has some positives after a torrid six months, with one in 10 people admitting they had missed their foreign trips so much they were planning on going away more than they did last year.Of the 2,600 surveyed by OnePoll, 495 identified themselves as managers, directors, or business owners.More than half of this group said they expected their business to come out of the pandemic the same or better than it was last year.  And four in 10 expected their business to come out worse, while 1 per cent feared going bankrupt or being forced to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A public health expert who advised New Zealand on its response to the coronavirus outbreak has said the UK needs another four weeks of intense lockdown before it can eradicate the virus.Michael Baker, a professor at the University of Otago, questioned why the UK was easing lockdown restrictions while imposing a 14-day travel quarantine for visitors to the country, and said both measures were needed.His comments come after New Zealand officially reported no active cases of Covid-19 in the country on Monday for the first time since 28 February. New Zealand premier Jacinda Ardern announced nearly all lockdown restrictions were being lifted as no new cases had been reported for over 14 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking to BBC’s Today programme, Michael Baker said New Zealand was able to “extinguish all chains of transmission” by banning foreign arrivals, testing and contact tracing and imposing an “intense lockdown”.New Zealand restricted travel early on to only allow residents returning from overseas in and required those entering the country to observe a strict 14-day quarantine.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“I’m shocked at the failure of the western world to assess the risk properly and act accordingly. We were taking our lead from the US and the UK and the World Health Organisation – the advice was wrong, basically.“Just in the nick of time, we looked to Asia and we followed their models which was treating this more like a SARS virus and going for elimination, and less like an influenza where you can’t contain it,” he said.“I think the problem was, we had the influenza pandemic plan, which is really a mitigation approach, so we had to turn that on its head and instead of gradually increasing your controls as a pandemic gets worse, you throw everything at it at the beginning and you extinguish it.“That’s what they did in mainland China and that’s what we did in New Zealand, and it works. I am actually really surprised that the UK is not doing the same thing. You have all the elements in place to eliminate the virus – you’re managing your borders, you have experience now with lockdown, you’re doing testing and contact tracing – you could eliminate this virus quite rapidly.”Mr Baker recommended that the UK continue imposing a “very intense lockdown for four to six weeks” for the UK and to carry on testing and contact tracing as the lockdown lifts.He noted that many people who would be entering the UK now would be coming from countries with a lower infection rate, adding that it was “odd” for the UK to require them to quarantine for 14 days without other lockdown measures in place.The UK government is forging ahead with further easing of the lockdown restrictions, as the government announced that zoos and non-essential retail shops in England will be allowed to reopen from Monday.Boris Johnson is expected to announce more changes to the lockdown as pressure builds to reopen the economy.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing.

Does that make sense to you?”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Hunt said that he has been disappointed by the lack of progress on resuming lessons for primary school children, but refused to criticise his boss in Downing Street, instead blaming unions for their lack of cooperation.“Well I think that some of the largest teaching unions – such as the National Education Union – they haven’t been particularly productive and positive in the discussions,” said Hunt.“I have to be honest with you, I think the vast majority of those involved in education are motivated by what is in the best interests of the children.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“But unfortunately, I’ve come to the conclusion that there does seem to be many people, particularly those involved at senior levels in teaching unions, who seem to be more motivated by scoring political points than getting as many children as possible back to school.”Asked what evidence he had to back up his claim, the MP accused the National union of “actively discouraging” teachers from conducting online lessons.Hunt was then asked by Derbyshire who exactly had made the comment, to which he replied: “I’ve got the quote...” but added that it was “not to hand”.He was then asked if he thought the government is doing enough in helping children get back to school. Mr Hunt that it will be children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds that suffer the most as a result of the continued closure of schools and reiterated that his passion for education.“Well do something about it then,” the presenter replied.Earlier this week, the government abandoned its pledge to get all primary school children back to class before the summer.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce this week that zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas in England can join non-essential shops in throwing open their doors as part of the relaxation of the coronavirus lockdown on 15 June.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He cried out, ‘The child is dead now and that’s a good thing’, then he said: ‘You can make a body disappear quickly. Pigs also eat human flesh’.”Christian B is currently eligible for parole having served two-thirds of his sentence for drug offences - but German legal experts say it is unlikely to go through as he is under investigation for murder.Follow our live blog below for all the latest news and updates.Hans Christian Wolters, Braunschweig state prosecutor, said he feared Madeleine was killed shortly after being abducted from her familys holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in .Mr Wolters told The Times: “My private opinion is that he relatively quickly killed the girl, possibly abused her and then killed her.“We believe our suspect committed further crimes, especially sexual crimes, in Portugal possibly but also where in Germany.”Christian B had also fantasised about wanting to #capture something small and use it for days in a chatroom exchange, according to earlier reports.The convicted rapist and paedophile allegedly discussed kidnapping and sexually abusing a child in a chatroom exchange in September , German newspaper Spiegel reported last week.Cops have no clue where Madeleines body is buried but do know how she was killed, it is claimed.\" title\"#Madeleine McCann cops think she was killed soon after abduction as Christian B #boasted about evidence being destroyed## # The Sun\" src\"https:www.thesun news  madeleine-mccann-cops-christian-b-boasted-evidence embed # secretbCDDxhfx\" data-secret\"bCDDxhfx\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"A German television documentary set to start at .pm UK time is set to reveal more bombshell details about the Madeleine McCann case.The documentary will speak to experts with inside knowledge of the probe into Madeleines disappearance.German profiler and crime expert Axel Petermann will piece together a picture of new suspect Christian B.He was revealed as a suspect on last Wednesdays edition of the German equivalent of Crimewatch.Well have all the latest on that here.Cops are revisiting their initial investigation of Christian B, in relation to the  disappearance of a five-year-old girl in Germany, say prosecutors in the northern town of Stendal.Inga Gehricke went missing on May , , from a forest in Schönebeck, Saxony-Anhalt, during a barbecue.At the time of her disappearance, the girl was visiting the Wilhelmshof district of Stendal.She went to collect wood for a campfire with other children in the forest.But, Inga did not , and there’s been no sign of her ever since.Like Madeleine’s case, there has been no trace of missing Inga, and a search with tracking dogs and police helicopters proved unsuccessful.Head of the investigation, Reimar Klockziem, told reporters in Germany that her disappearance was “inexplicable and unbelievable”.It was asInga had been #beamed away from the world”, he said.Bunte pointed out in May, , that “only a few missing persons cases are not cleared up in Germany for a long time. One of them is that of Inga.”The publication spoke to profiler Axel Petermann, who said there was “no recognisable motive, no crime scene, no traces of a crime, and no body.”Now, though, the new suspect Christian B in the Madeleine McCann case is being investigated over the disappearance of the five-year-old.Madeleine McCann cops also fear that Christian B could be linked to another #German Maddie# who was snatched and killed in .Peggy Knobloch, nine, vanished on her way home from school in May  but her remains were not discovered until  years later in a forest near her home in Baia.The case is Germanys most infamous unsolved child murder and the chilling similarities between little Peggys disappearance and Madeleines led to her being dubbed the #German Maddie#.Investigators are now re-examining her brutal killing to establish whether there is a link to Christian B, who had been released from jail for child sex attacks just months before she vanished.Bayreuth chief prosecutor Martin Dippold said: “The suspect in the Maddie case is now also being reviewed in the Peggy case.#The new prime suspect Christian B was already known to British and Portuguese police in relation to Madeleines disappearance in Praia da Luz.Yet, the latest information came from a witness who stepped forward following the appeal by the Met Police on the tenth anniversary in .The suspect # who is  now # is believed to have been leading a #transient lestyle# at the time, as he travelled between Portugal and Germany.It is believed he was living in the Iberian nation between  and  working in the food industry.The man is known to have been in the area at the time of Madeleines disappearance, having taken a -minute phone call an hour before she went missing.CHRISTIAN B. will NOT give any information on her disappearance, his lawyer said today.His attorney Friedrich Fülscher, who represents him with lawyer Johann Schwenn, told RTL today: #Christian B is not making any statements on the case at the moment and we ask for your understanding that we as defense attorneys are not making any statements either.#He said he had visited Christian B. in prison at Kiel Penitentiary, where the -year-old German was being held in solitary confinement, it was reported.When asked how his client was doing, Mr Fülscher replied: #How should a person be doing who is isolated in a prison and accused of the worst crimes by half the worlds population #MADELEINE MCCANN suspect “Christian B” was last week unmasked as a -year-old drter.He is a prolic burglar, who has previous convictions for sex crimes against young girls.Born in Germany in , he moved to Portugal in his late teens.The suspect # who was  at the time of Madeleines disappearancein  # has twice been convicted for sex crimes against young girls.German police # who are treating Madeleines case as a murder inquiry # believe he initially planned to rob the holiday apartment before he #moved on to a sexual motive#.IN , Christian B was investigated over a missing girl from Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, Inga Gehricke.The chief Madeleine McCann suspect was in Saxony-Anhalt when Inga vanished on a family day out in .Cops investigating Ingas disappearance searched Christian Bs home in Neuwegersleben, Saxony-Anhalt, in February  the Volksstimme newspaper reports.But the case was closed after four weeks.Christian B refused to comment about Inga’s disappearance when questioned in prison recently by German police.It is understood a detective from the Met’s Operation Grange team investigating Madeleine’s abduction was also present during the interview.TWO British ex-girlfriends of the main suspect in the Madeleine McCann Case are #terried# he will be released.A pal told The Sun: “They’ve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and don’t know what to do.“Their first priority is to help police because they know a lot of things that probably join up a lot of the dots in the investigation.“Their main concern is making sure he’s convicted and stays in prison because they know what kind of person he is.“They’re terried he might get out one day and come for them.#A GERMAN television documentary is set to reveal more bombshell details about theMadeleine McCann case tonight.The two-hour special, which airs tonight, will speak to people with inside knowledge of the investigation into the little girls disappearance.Clarence Mitchell, a long-term close adviser of the McCanns, and Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt are among those who will speak on the RTL show.A WOMAN who was raped in  fears Christian B may be her attacker, but Portuguese authorities are said to have ruled him out as a suspect.Hazel Behan has now given a statement to the Met Police, who said they will contact Portuguese police.

THE police investigation into Christian B may be dropped without more information from the public on the Madeleine McCann suspect.Prosecutors believe they have evidence Madeleine is dead, but not enough to charge the -year-old German.Hans Christian Wolters, a prosecutor in Braunschweig told the BBC: #We have evidence against the accused which leads us to believe that he really killed Madeleine but this evidence is not strong enough at the moment to take him to court.#One has to be honest and remain open to the possibility that our investigation could end without a charge, that it ends like the others have.#Read the full story here.THE Madeleine McCann prime suspect may be linked to the  disappearance of a seven-year-old boy who vanished on a beach in the Netherlands, police have said.Dutch police are working with German authorities to determine whether Christian B was behind the disappearance of Jaïr Soares, who went missing in August .Police in The Hague said they were going to #exchange information# about the suspect with German cops.Jaïr vanished from a beach near the Zuid-Holland town of Monster nearly  years ago.Leo Simais, from The Hagues cold case team, told Dutch paper De Telegraaf: #We would be crazywe didnt look closely at this German man.#DETECTIVES are also investigating Christian B over the unsolved murder of nine-year-old Peggy Knobloch, who vanished on her way home from school in Thueringen, Baia, in.

She lived in Praia da Luz when she dated the convicted paedophile in the early s.She is understood to have been questioned previously by detectives at her current home in Lagos but the nature of her evidence has not come to light until now.She has now spoken again to police re-focusing inquiries on -year-old Christian B., who is serving his prison sentence in Germany. The ex-girlfriend is not a suspect but agreed to co-operate by giving a statement.She is a friend of the other British woman, also in a relationship with Christian B. in the noughties.There is no suggestion either of the women had any clue about any involvement he might have had in the abduction of the British toddler.A PAL of Christian Bs told The Sun that the Madeleine McCann suspect#had a campervan but wasnt a hippy as has been said#.The friend, who knew the German while he was in Portugal, said: #He wasnt a bad-looking bloke and was always well groomed.#He was quite brash and loud and was also a bit of a charmer and I could see why women might be attracted to him.#But I never liked him because Im a close friend of both of the British girls he dated and they both told me he beat them up.#Theyve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and dont know what to do.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris wants distancing cut to one metre, giving the all-clear for pubs and restaurants to reopen and start rehiring the millions laid off since lockdown.Rishi Sunak is counting on this to trim Treasury job-support measures costing the economy a dizzying £billion.It will kickstart a new-normal summer, with open-air weddings, beer-garden service and marquees to protect punters from the rain.Summer holidays are back on track after being stymied for weeks.Airlines will bypass quarantine with air corridors to approved holiday destinations such as Italy, France, Greece and Turkey.These measures are not risk-free. Scientists point to a possible surge in Covid cases in the North.But equally reputable experts insist there is little chance of a second wave.The risk of the NHS failing to cope has now passed.Meanwhile, lockdown has brought its own death toll. Countless lives have certainly been lost from failure to diagnose and treat cancers and heart diseases.The price in lost schooling and crippled le chances will be paid for decades to come.Lting lockdown is a tough decision for any prime minister.But, as Boris knows better than most, to lead is to choose.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A report on the state-run Korean Central News Agencysaid that the North would shut off all communication from midday today. In the absence of formal diplomatic relations or embassies, the two countries typically communicate via a jointly-run body called the Inter-Korean Liaison Office. The office maintains a number of lines of communication, including hotlines between senior figures within the countries militaries as well as their presidential offices. The North has released a series of statements over the last week threatening to close the officethe South did not stop defectors sending anti-regime material back over the border. Defectors from North Korea are known to use a number of methods, including pamphlets dropped from small air balloons, to get information back into the country. The move is likely also part of diplomatic manoeuvring related to severe international sanctions currently in place on the North, the Times reported. The sanctions are thought to be having a devastating impact on North Koreas economy and population. Despite the decision only officially coming into force today, a spokesperson for the South Korean ministry of defence said routine daily calls made through the liaison office yesterday went unanswered. Daniel Wertz, Programme Manager at the National Committee on North Korea, tweeted that severing communications was a well-worn play for the North, but a dangerous one amid the coronavirus crisis. The spat comes after Kim Jong-un disappeared from view for almost three weeks in April, prompting speculation about his health as well as reports of his death. He reemerged at the beginning of May, and this week was seen smiling at a meeting of senior officials from the ruling Workers Party.The KNCA report stated that Kim and other senior figures in Pyongyang had decided that “the work towards the South should thoroughly turn into one against an enemy”.“[The North Korean people have] been angered by the treacherous and cunning behaviour of the South Korean authorities, with whom we will have lots of accounts to settle, it said. “We have reached a conclusion that there is no need to sit face to face with the South Korean authorities and there is no issue to discuss with them, as they have only aroused our dismay.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right. So the only travellers affected by this ludicrous policy will be the law-abiding and public figures who risk being spotted on holiday then named and shamedthey don’t self-isolate upon .Everyone  can just give their details as Mickey Mouse of Taking The Mickey Street, and go about their le with impunity.Meanwhile, the airline industry is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy because it sends out the message that Britain is closed.Well.

Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit.

The free world model or the Chinese surveillance model which can look very attractive to a lot of the developing world.”The former spy, who served more than  years, insisted Britain could manage the risk posed by Huawei’s current G kit. He dismissed US threats to stop intelligence sharingBritain used G as “spurious”.Boris Johnson has faced a backlash from Tory MPs calling for Huawei to be banned from Britain’s G network on security grounds.“The idea Beijing will change its ways and stop trying to export its dictatorial systemwe adopt Huawei tech is laughable,” said Neil O’Brien, a Conservative MP and founder of the China Research Group.Natos chief Jens Stoltenburg warned China was changing the global balance of power yesterday and he urged like minded countries to stand up to its bullying and coercion.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This cost us time and a lot of wasted money which unfortunately we were unable to get back.”The pair found a better-skilled builder who stepped in and “did an amazing job turning the church into our home. “I absolutely adore my home, it’s everything I’ve always wanted to do since I was small,” Hannah said.“I love everything to do with houses and home décor so this was like my blank canvas to do anything I wanted. “Its perfect and just very me in every single way. My favourite areas are the kitchen area and my pink entrance hall. I have lots of bright colours as my job can be quite stressful so coming into a bright happy space really helps me escape.To budding home-decorators, she recommended researching builders thoroughly and getting plenty of quotes before getting the work done to save money and stress in the long-run.She noted: “Seek out people who have done similar projects or renovations, ask their advice as sometimes it’s best to know what to avoid doing as well as what to do.“Don’t be afraid to do something totally unusual and quirky, whatever your style is just go for it.

What that required for that to happen was a robust national plan.

We will be working to bring all children back to school in September.”But he stressed that the R rate was below one across the country, and he expected more kids to come back in, in the following weeks.The Government has accepted that schools wont have the room to get everyone back in and will show flexibility to heads to be able to act how they feel is best.With Childrens Commissioner Anne Longfield accusing ministers of furloughing childhood, The Sun looked at the options to get kids back in school.One option would be putting lessons in much bigger rooms so pupils can stay more than two metres apart.Former chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is among those urging on lessons needing more space.Sir Michael said: “If youre going to insist on social distancing and a maximum of  in a class we will need double the amount of space, we will need double the amount of teachers and weve got to make sure we have that.”This could see the Nightingale Hospitals that were set up across the UK to deal with a surge finally given a use.Yesterday, Reverend Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis chain of academy schools suggested using other buildings.He said: “In any community there are other buildings that can be used - community halls, churches and other faith groups buildings, hotels.“Weve explored conversations with some people like that so you can bring children back in and use those buildings because their emotional and social development is so important.”Another would be slashing the Governments two-metre social distancing rules.SAGE adviser Shaun Fitzgerald of Cambridge University, who helped draw up the rule, claimed more focus was needed on how people are together, not the distance.He said: “The thing which is missing from a simple two-metre rule is consideration of other factors, such as time, duration and orientation.“Its all three that are important. I would not want to be  meter apart from somebody for an extended period because thats much, much higher risk than two metres.“But being less than two metres for a short period and Im not facing that person are ameliorating factors. If things evolve, it isnt necessarily because the evidence is any dferent.”The PM suggested today that the UKs two metre rule could be loweredthe number of cases of coronavirus drops.Chair of the Commons Education Committee and Conservative MP Robert Halfon said summer camps rather than enforced time in classrooms is the current favoured plan to stop students falling behind in their education.Mr Halfon said summer camps, rather than formal summer schooling is the more likely option to help children who would otherwise fall behind.He told The Sun: The most likely thing is summer school or mentoring and a catch up premium - it would be like a school camp run by volunteers.Mr Halfon said the catch up premium could work to get more cash to charities - such as Teach First - who could use it help bolster programs for children.He added:a catch up premium that is specically designated for those disadvantaged pupils who havent been learning, to give funding to existing education charities around the country to help them scale up tutoring for those people.Schools could also follow in the footsteps of the privately educated and supply teachers with face screens and other PPE equipment.Ministers have previously rejected a similar plan, and the idea is expensive.Former Education Secretary Justine Greening called for a national plan, rather than saying all kids would go back and doing a U-turn.She said: “Weve had a national effort on both the NHS and protecting jobs and we now need the same national effort on schools,“I think many people will be very surprised that there isnt yet a government plan in place to help our schools get back open and theres also not a government plan in place to help children that have been most affected by the schools shutdown to be able to catch up.“And the big risk for Boris Johnsons government now is that unless they bring forward a proper joined-up strategy, then it wont be a government that delivers levelling up in Britain, it will end up being a government that levels down and nobody wants to see that.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

an end to what was dubbed Boris bonking ban after measures prohibited people from seeing other people indoors.It means from Saturday lonely Brits will be able to choose one other person to include in their bubble so they dont need to social distance.The announcement also meansBut crucially, people wont be able to hop in and out of multiple homes - only the two people within the bubble.If any member of the bubble develops symptoms of coronavirus, everyone will have to self-isolate for  days as though they are in the same household.If others develop symptoms they should be tested too.Officials stressed earlier that the policy was separate to the rules which allow people to meet up in groups of six outside their own household in a park or garden -

You usually need to be at least  years old to work on a farm, but there may be roles for  to -year-olds depending on the business and for most roles previous experience is not required, with training given by the farms. Ideally farms are looking for people who can work a full working week but days and hours can y by farm and according to the weather.  Pay depends on your employer and the job you do. You may be paid a set hourly rate or a piece rate which ies depending upon how much you pick.  However, you will always be paid the national minimum living wage  for the average of the hours that you work in a pay period.

Asked directly about what their biggest regret was, Boris Johnson dodged the question.But Professor Whitty pointed to the slow development of Britainaposs testing regime.The Chief Medical Officer said: I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously. If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems that we have had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were. Professor Whitty added it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak. He warned there was a reasonable chance that the virus would have certain advantagesthere was a second wave in the winter. It is something that transmits more easily indoors and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter, he said. The nature of new epidemics is very often they come in waves circling around the world andwe get hit by another wave, at that point we need to understand better what is the optimal mix of things we could do. It came after a former top Government advisor said Britainaposs coronavirus death toll could have been halvedlockdown was introduced a week earlier. Britain has an official death toll from confirmed COVID- cases of over ,, rising to over , cases when deaths from suspected cases are included. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced the lockdown on March . Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who had to step down from scientic advisory group SAGE after breaking lockdown to meet a woman with from another household, told MPs that the UK had taken the right measures against Covid- but too late. He told the Science and Technology Committee: The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced.So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have then reduced the final death toll by at least a half.  He went on: So whilst I think the measures ... were warranted ... certainly had we introduced them earlier, we would have seen many fewer deaths. At the No  briefing Mr Whitty declined to be drawn on a claim by Professor Neil Ferguson that the death rate could have been cut by halfthe country had gone into lockdown a week earlier. I think a iety of dferent people are going to come with dferent answers on the timing question, he said. Part of the problem that we had at that stage is that we had very limited information about this virus.

A single-adult household can form a bubble with one other household and act as though they live together, permanently. It means two households can finally break the two-metre rule to meet, laugh and love for the first time in almost three months. And some separated couples can finally reunite for overnight stays and sex. Boris Johnson announced the shake-up tonight as he unveiled separate changes from June  - including re-opening non-essential shops and zoos. It will be valuable respite to millions whose mental health has been stomped on by lockdown. But critics may warn itaposs far too soon as the UK still notches up hundreds of deaths per day. And the policy is strictly limited to certain situations - with other lockdown rules very much continuing as planned. That means it will leave some bizarre loopholes and many people will feel theyaposre left out. Meanwhile, million people who are shielding will be unable to benefit from forming a bubble with another household, for their own protection.

They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . “All of those who are in a support bubble will be able to act asthey live in the same household,” a No spokesman confirmed. It will be the first time in three months that dferent households have been given permission to break the two-metre social distancing rule. But there are strict conditions to this and it does not apply to all households.  One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative. Where does the policy apply  Only in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland form their own rules.  Do both households have to be people living alone  No. Only one of the two households being joined together needs to be a “single-adult household”. As long as one household in a bubble fulfils this criteria, the other household is not limited in size.  No. “You can’t switch the household you’re in a bubble with or make a connection with multiple households,” a No spokesman said. This is because it would create chains of transmission that spread the virus through the community. Can aposshieldedapos people form a bubble   No. The million or so people in England who have been told to shielding because they are “extremely clinically vulnerable” cannot form a bubble. They are still advised to keep two metres apart from other households and avoid all social contact - advice which will last at least until June . They can leave the house, but only with members of their own household - orthey live alone, to meet one member of another household from m away. This is likely to create fresh frustration for the millions whoaposve been trapped indoors for medical reasons, living under dferent rules to the rest of the country. A No spokesman said: “Unfortunately we can’t advise anyone who is shielding to form a household bubble. “We do know how hard it is for people who are shielding and we’re keeping the advice under close review, but we’re not able to advise today that they could form a bubble.” Who will this help - and who won’t it help  HELPED: A widow aged  can go round her daughter’s house to stay with her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren. NOT HELPED: Two married grandparents, aged  and , can’t visit their daughter’s house to stay with their daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren. HELPED: A single mum can go stay with her mum and dad to help with childcare. NOT HELPED: Married parents can’t go stay with the we’s mum and dad to help with childcare. HELPED: A -year-old man who lives alone in a bedsit can go stay with both his parents, who are married and live together. NOT HELPED: A -year-old man who lives in a house-share can’t go stay with his parents, who are married and live together. HELPED: A -year-old man who lives with his mates can stay the night with his -year-old girlfriend, who lives alone in her own flat. NOT HELPED: A -year-old man who lives with his mates can’t stay the night with his -year-old girlfriend, who lives with her mates too. HELPED: A lonely widow who wants to reunite with her -year-old daughter can have her round for the night. NOT HELPED: A lonely widow who wants to reunite with her -year-old daughter and -year-old son has to pick one of them to have round for the night. Whatboth sets of grandparents want to come and stay   Then you have a problem. The rules clearly state each household can only have a bubble with one other household. That meansyour maternal grandma and paternal grandma both live alone, and both want to see you… you have to pick one of them. One of them can form a “bubble” with you, come over, hug, eat and stay the night for months to come. The other one you have to see from two metres away in the park or garden. So it won’t help everyone  No. A No spokesman said: “We fully understand this isn’t going to help everyone, but it is a very targeted intervention there to support those who have been particularly isolated by the lockdown.” He added: “We know there are many lonely or isolated people as a result of the pandemic and the lockdown which has been in place and that is a particularly signicant issue for those people who live by themselves. “So we’re making this change to provide those people with additional support.” Does this affect current rules on meeting outside  No. This policy is separate to other current rules in England, which say you can meet in groups of up to six outdoors in a socially distanced way. That rule is unaffected by this new policy which is designed to let people meet indoors. How far away can each household in a bubble be  There is no limit - as long as it’s in England. The government asks people to stay local wherever possible, but understand there will be instances where they can’t do that. You don’t have to move in with the household you’ve formed a bubble with. Whatsomeone in the bubble gets sick  Once you’ve joined together in a “support bubble”, you must treat the rules as though you’re all in the same household. That means the moment one of you develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the support bubble must start self-isolating for  days. Will I be punished for setting up two bubbles at once   No. It will be taken on trust, like many of the other more complex lockdown rules. People will not have to fill out forms telling the authorities who they are forming a bubble with. What about children of orced parents  It remains the case that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households and share the care. These households are not prohibited from setting up support bubbles under the system. Put another way, the children of separated parents could potentially be in two support bubbles at once - one bubble for each parent. So does this all mean the end of the sex ban  "},{"url":null,"title":"mps demand judge led inquiry","story":"NewsMPs demand judge-led inquiry into the Post Office horizon scandalFormer Conservative minister Dr Julian Lewis said the prosecution of postmasters over missing money is one of the worst disasters in public le since the contaminated blood scandalShareByPress AssociationOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe Post Office prosecuted postmasters over missing money despite having evidence its own computer system could be to blame \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Post Office prosecuted postmasters over missing money despite having evidence its own computer system could be to blame. Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches. Some wrongly accused of fiddling the books were were jailed, others took their own lives. Former Conservative minister Dr Julian Lewis said the prosecution of postmasters over missing money is one of the worst disasters in public le since the contaminated blood scandal. Fellow Tory Jerome Mayhew agreed and urged inidual culpability of senior management figures to be considered following the scandal which left some postmasters being made bankrupt while others were prosecuted and jailed.But Business Minister Paul Scully said the independent review into the Post Officeaposs Horizon system would be the same as a judge-led inquiry and that the latter would be too long. It comes as an investigation found the Post Office was aware its computer system could have been to blame for cash shortfall issues when it prosecuted postmasters over missing money. Dr Lewis said: Does the minister agree thatit is proven that Post Office executives were aware of the software faults that allowed innocent people to rot in jail then they were guilty of criminal negligence, and possibly criminal conspiracy, and therefore ought to be brought to justice  Will the proposed inquiry allow that to be done  Mr Scully replied: Mr Justice Fraser considered what happened ... and set out his findings in considerable detail and, as I said, he has referred some iniduals towards the Criminal Prosecution Service as well. In response to Mr Mayhewaposs call for inidual culpability of senior management figures within the Post Office to be part of this review, Mr Scully said: When looking at what went wrong, that will by necessity need to look at who took what decisions and when. Former Tory cabinet minister Sir John Redwood called for the Post Office to apologise to wronged sub-postmasters and for the business to pay generous compensation. Mr Scully said: The terms of reference of this review is the same as a public inquiry. It is to work out who is to blame, can it happen again, how can we prevent it from happening again, what the wrongs were and letaposs get those righted. Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael said an independent review just isnapost going to cut it. He said: The minister says that this is a complex case spanning a long period of time, and he is absolutely right about that, that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry. That is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now  Mr Scully replied: The point is that the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.

Campaigners, including the Childrensapos Commissioner, have warned that less well off children are going to be left further behind their rich peers unless something is done to close the gap. Yesterday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ditched a plan to get all primary pupils back into the classroom before the summer holidays. Ministers have been urged by some, including Conservative MPs, to look at introducing summer schools to help close this gap. But teaching unions have taken a skeptical approach and warned that putting children into an education setting over the summer could make things more dficult in the following academic year. One proposal has been to draft retired teachers to he[p staff the as yet theoretical summer schools. And while no details  have been announced, No  today refused to rule out asking former teachers toto the profession. A Downing Street spokesman said: “We are working to bring all children back in September and are considering what more is needed to support pupils.” Asked specically to rule out the move, the spokesman refused. He added: “We’ve also said we’re looking at what further support we can provide over the summer It came among calls for grade boundaries should be relaxed so more pupils who had exams cancelled amid the Covid- pandemic receive higher results, MPs have heard. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union , said the move, which he acknowledged was controversial, was needed to ensure pupils are not unfairly disadvantaged this year. The call from the teachersapos union leader came after MPs and equality experts raised concerns over how the use of teacher-assessed grades this summer could disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups. Addressing a virtual Education Select Committee, Mr Courtney said: Ofqual needs to relax the grade boundaries. There needs to be more children getting all of the higher grades. Where there is doubt, somebody should move up a grade rather than moving down a grade. That will mean the exams will be regarded as not having the same rigour as the previous exam series, but I donapost see how  weaposre going to get through this. Lee Elliot Major, Professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, has called for a systematic review of GCSE and A-level results once they are published to look at fairness among dferent groups. He said: I think the worry is that unintentionally teachers will underestimate, sometimes, the academic potential of poorer pupils, potentially those from black backgrounds, and potentially boys as well.  Professor Elliot Major told MPs that students who leave their revision right to the last minute are most likely to be penalised under the new system - including summer-born children who are less mature. The social mobility expert also warned of a tsunami of anxiety facing Year  and Year  pupils who are due to sit their GCSEs and A-levels next year despite schools and colleges being closed for  weeks. A combination of teacher assessments and core exams is needed to determine grades next year, he said. Addressing recent reports that students may see their summer exam series disrupted next year, Sally Collier, the chief regulator of Ofqual, said the Government was considering the impact on lost teaching. She told MPs that a consultation process on the  exam series is due in the coming weeks.

He added: So will the Prime Minister now turbocharge the Governmentaposs responses and tell us when heaposll implement in full the Lammy Report and the Windrush recommendations  Mr Johnson replied: Of course I understand, as I said, I understand the very strong and legitimate feelings of people in this country at the death of George Floyd and of course I agree that black lives matter.

The Prime Minister will update the nation on the easing of the restrictions on Wednesday as he tries to reopen the economy while minimising Covid-aposs rate of transmission. Under pressure from zoos warning they face an existential threat, Mr Johnson will say at the Downing Street press conference they can reopen next week as long as they can uphold social distancing rules. He will also announce the easing of restrictions on outdoor attractions where people remain in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas, because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. The move will pave the way for zoos to reopen in England alongside non-essential shops, despite schools remaining shuttered to many pupils. A Downing Street official said: People are continuing to make huge sacrices to reduce the spread of coronavirus and avoid a second spike, but we know it is tough and where we can safely open up more attractions, and it is supported by the science, we will do so. This is by necessity a careful process, but we hope the reopening of safari parks and zoos will help provide families with more options to spend time outdoors while supporting the industry caring for these incredible animals. The announcement will come after London Zoo and other institutions across the nation warned they may face permanent closurethey were not allowed to reopen. The PMaposs father, Stanley Johnson, had joined calls for zoos to reopen as soon as possible after they were ordered to close when the lockdown was imposed on March . Though the easing will be a relief, zoos will be told that they must not reopen indoor exhibitions, such as reptile houses, and must ensure amenities including cafes are take-away only. The relaxation comes as the Government faces criticism over its handling of schools after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson conceded English primaries will not be able to welcome back all pupils before the summer holidays as planned. Children in nursery, Reception, Year  and Year  in England began ing to primary school last week but some schools have said they do not have the space to admit all pupils while following Government advice to limit class sizes to .  Mr Williamsonaposs concession will mean many primary school children will notto classes until September, along with most students in secondary school. Andrew Hall, spokesperson for Biaza - British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums, said: Biaza is obviously delighted that zoos and safari parks have been given the flexibility to reopen. But as a sector, we are not out of the woods. Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit. For some zoos, particularly those reliant on tourism, reopening isnapost going to be financially viable for them.

Chloe Lloyd was driving home from her motheraposs with her eight-year-old daughter Lexi when her Vauxhall Astra left the road and crashed into a tree. She was speaking on a hands-free mobile to her boyfriend Domenico Gugliemucci when he heard a scream before the line went quiet.

Then it went quiet, with the only sound the indicators. Miss Lloyd was pronounced dead at the scene on the A at Upton, Poole, Dorset, on January . Her daughter continues to recover from her injuries under the care of her grandparents after receiving emergency treatment in hospital. On the day of the tragic crash, the inquest heard Miss Lloyd had spent time with her mother and daughter before a meal with her father, Martyn. She was last seen alive at around .pm when she set off to drive home. Around  minutes later her parents received the devastating call from Mr Gugliemucci.  A statement from Miss Lloydaposs mother was also read out at the inquest. In the statement Mrs Lloyd said: After the meal Chloe and her father were messing about and joking with one another, as they usually did. She was happy and content and making plans for the future. A post mortem examination show Miss Lloyd, who held a driving licence for  years and had no endorsements, died from multiple injures. Further tests showed she had no alcohol or drugs in her system, and did not have any underlying health conditions. A police investigation found the car had no mechanical defects and that all four tyres were in a serviceable condition. Miss Lloydaposs mobile phone was in her handbag inside the car, connected to her hands-free system via bluetooth, police found. No other vehicles were involved in the collision and witness statements said that Miss Lloydaposs car just lost control, spun around and then careered off the carriageway and collided with the tree. Road conditions were good and police found no evidence of any object in the carriageway or even any animal in or by the side of the road.  Ms Grfin said: Iaposm satisfied from all the evidence before me that the cause of her death is as the result of injuries that Miss Lloyd sustained in a road traffic collision. Following a thorough investigation by Dorset Police they did not find any reason why Miss Floydaposs vehicle left the carriageway that day. She was not driving at excessive speed. There is no physical evidence to account for why her vehicle left the carriageway that day. I know that Chloe was on the phone, but it is clear she was acting within the law and using a hands-free device to make that call. That phone call was very short, her phone was found within her bag - so there was no evidence to suggest she had handled that telephone to make a call.

And since moving to their tree house retreat, the couple have been joined by a third member of the family, nine-week-old Labrador puppy, Duke, who will accompany them when theyto London. Sam said: My favourite thing about being here is the simplicity of le and being able to switch off and relax. Thereaposs a sense of freedom here that you donapost get in London.  It has made us appreciate the things that we would pass every day in London, but not notice because we were too busy or distracted by something  going on. Rebecca added: It hasnapost been lonely. Lots of my friends canapost comprehend that we havenapost felt lonely or isolated, but it has brought us closer together. Weaposve been growing cucumber, radish and strawberries among other vegetables. We had our first harvest in the last week.  Back in London I canapost even keep a house plant alive. It has been such a transformation. With lockdown now easing the couple plan on remaining living in the tree house until the end of June, before ing to the hustle and bustle of the capital. The tree house will then open to visitors again provided lockdown restrictions remain ease and will soon be available to book through Canopy  Stars - a travel agency specialising in luxury camping. However, they say their time in the countryside has made them reassess their priorities and for Rebecca, their three months in the woods has brought back fond memories of growing up in the Warwickshire countryside. She said: Itaposs a bit like ing to my childhood being here. The last time I grew a runner bean was with my dad when I was young. Staying here has made us question what we have in London. Weaposll probably stay living in London, but we definitely want more nature around us in the future.

Gemma Palmer had her lips injected with a full millilitre of lip filler - double her usual dose - after she trusted a local beautician. But she was left with a lopsided, swollen and painful mouth after the the liquid gathered together on the right side of her top lip. The -year-old had the fillers dissolved and she was pain free for eight months until her lip became hot and painful, doubled in size and then burst - a painful five times. Two years on and support worker Gemma said experts have told her they reckon lip filler is still trapped inside her face. The mum-of-one from Litherland, Lancashire, is awaiting specialist treatment to have it removed, and is warning other women of the dangers of fillers. Gemma said: It was horric, I was in so much pain both physically and mentally. My lip made me cry and I was so upset both before and after my lip exploded as the pain and the swelling affected my everyday le.  I was really scared and worried when my lip exploded - I was so anxious that it could leave me disfigured le. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed to leave my house and also embarrassed to tell people what exactly had happened. All together, Iaposve had about six weeks off of work because of the lip filler problems.  Gemma had previously had half a millilitre of lip filler injected in August  with no problems. Missing her plumped pout, she had her lips injected again in October , this time with a full millilitre of lip filler - and disastrous consequences. One week after her injection, Gemmaaposs lip filler clumped together in a painful lump on the right side of her top lip.  Her lip was so swollen and painful that she couldnapost eat anything but soup and after being unable to massage the filler out of her lip, Gemma was forced to eventually have her filler dissolved a week later. The clump in her lip was finally gone and Gemma ed to normal le but eight months later, her lip grew hot and swollen again in July . Gemma said: I was at home cleaning when I felt a burning sensation and throbbing in my lip.  I knew it was about to flare up again but hoped it would be ok by the morning - how wrong I was! I woke up and my lip had swollen up so much that I could hardly speak. It carried on swelling over the next couple of days until it finally popped open which was both disgusting and extremely painful. Gemma visited her local GP surgery but despite telling them about her previous problems with lip fillers, her issue was dismissed as a cold sore.Sent home with anti viral tablets, Gemmaaposs lip slowly cleared up over the next few weeks but sheaposs had the same problem come back every few months. She has now suffered with her lip swelling and exploding five times - most recently in March this year.  Gemma said: The pain gets more extreme every time and this time round has definitely been the worst. My whole mouth filled with blisters from the swelling which kept popping and filling my entire mouth with blood. I couldnapost eat, I was in constant pain. Tired of being dismissed by doctors she visited a private cosmetic surgery expert who finally told her why it was happening. She told me straight away that there was still lip filler trapped inside my top lip two years after I got injected, she said. She will be putting a dissolvant in my lip and then Iaposll be on antibiotics for a week and hopefully this will be the last time it happens.

As he celebrates his th birthday, they will no doubt reflect on times past as they have lunch together at Windsor Castle.The couple have been staying at the Queen’s favourite residence with a reduced household of around  staff, dubbed Operation HMS Bubble, throughout the coronavirus outbreak.To mark his birthday, Buckingham Palace has released a commemorative photo of the couple taken last week at the castle in Berkshire. The duke, in a military Household Division tie and double-breasted jacket, stood beside the head of state wearing an Angela Kelly dress with the Cullinan V diamond brooch first worn by Queen Mary. Philip has spent much of his retirement at his cottage, Wood Farm, on the Sandringham estate, more than  miles away from the Queen, , who was usually at Buckingham Palace or Windsor. But they took the decision to reunite for the duration of the Covid- outbreak. Sources have often remarked that the success of the Queen and Philip’s marriage has been put down to their dfering personalities. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said: “This must be the longest they’ve been under the same roof for many years, I would say.  “Perhaps it’s always been a case of absence makes the heart grow fonder. They would go through periods of not seeing much of each other, but it’s an opportunity in their later years to reconnect. It is the perfect royal cocooning... “The Queen is much less confrontational so I suppose they are opposites in many ways but clearly the chemistry has worked as they are now in the rd year of marriage.” They wed in Westminster Abbey in . Philip, born into the Greek and Danish royal families, gave up a promising military career to be by the Queen’s side as she was crowned in  aged .

The former monarchaposs likeness, standing in a park in Leeds, also had the letters BLM - meaning Black Lives Matter - written on the stone base. The bronze monument also had coloniser and racist daubed on it. It comes amid calls to remove statues of slave traders, owners and colonialists.

The Queen Victoria statue, in Leedsapos Hyde Park, was unveiled in  and originally stood outside the town hall. Among those calling for statues to be removed across Britain is a group called Topple the Racists, which said: “We believe these statues and other memorials to slave-owners and colonialists need to be removed so that Britain can finally face the truth about its past – and how it shapes our present. “Statues are exercises of public adoration. And Edward Colston made his fortune in the slave trade.  “He was part of a system of mass murder, torture and human suffering. “We must learn from, not venerate, this terrible chapter in British colonial history.” Some people in the park have been posing with pictures of the defaced monument which also has words such as “murderer”, “justice” and “racist”.

The -year-old was given a piece of chocolate and some warm socks by his rescuer, before Ben called for help. In a bid to keep the teen calm and relaxed as the pair waited for the rescue team together, Ben spoke to William about Bertie and Diesel from Thomas the Tank Engine. A rescue helicopter was circling overhead, but the loud noise caused William to cover his ears. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   Ben called and asked for the chopper to be stood down while a truck with the boysapos mum made its way to them. Speaking to reporters at the scene in Victoria, Australia, Ben was askedWilliam was happy to see him. He replied: No, he was just happy to get the chocolate.Ben added that he had been coming up the mountain since he was a child, so knew his way around. More than  people, largely made of volunteers, had been searching the area around mountainaposs summit since the teen disappeared at around .pm on Monday. Ben said: He looked in reasonable health, he wasnapost shivering too bad, he didnapost have socks on so I put some socks on him and a jacket, and gave him some chocolate.  I carried him, he was extremely light, and then eventually I could hear some of the other guys to signal for him. Mum Penny Callaghan and step-dad Nathan Ezard were there to greet him. Ms Callaghan, who was astonished her son was found alive after so long - said he had used sign language to indicate he was scared. I canapost imagine what he has been feeling and going through, she said, adding that he requested fast-food as his first meal in days.Mrs Callaghan went on to thank bushwalker Ben and said she now plans to take William on holiday. Speaking to rescuers, she said: Thank you all, youaposre all amazing. Rescuers had been warned not to clap as they worked to encourage the teenager into the rescue vehicle, as he is afraid of loud noises. Those at the mountainaposs base camp, where the rescue effort was stationed, were pictured hugging and cheering as the news filtered through.Covered in a puffer jacket and hoodie, William was taken to the camp where he was checked over by a paramedic.

Joana Cipriano, eight, was reported missing in  from Figueira – five miles from the Praia da Luz apartment on the Algarve where Madeleine vanished as her parents ate with friends nearby. Her mum Leonor Cipriano and uncle Joao Cipriano were convicted of murdering the youngster, whose body has never been found, and spent nearly two decades behind bars. But the pair insist they are innocent and Leonor claimed she was tortured by Portuguese detectives into confessing to the killing her daughter.  Joana’s step-dad Leandro Silva has now called on German and Portuguese police to investigatethere are any links between pervert Brueckner and the child’s disappearance after he became the latest suspect in Madeleine’s case. The -year-old said: “The moment I saw police had a Madeleine suspect I thought about poor Joana and how he could be involved. “The disappearance of my step-daughter is an ­unresolved case, whatever the authorities say.  “Her body has never been found and I know Leonor would never have hurt Joana. She was a good mum. “I think the police handled the investigation so badly. “That’s why I’d like a new police team to re-examine everything and seethis German man is involved. “Brueckner also seems to have been heavily into drugs and I think there’s a good chance he could be implicated.  “He appears to have done some horrible things here and he obviously knew the Algarve well. “Christian Brueckner is a person who should be questioned. There are still so many unanswered questions hanging over Joana’s ­disappearance and he could hold the key to solving them. Dad-of-three Leandro, from Portimao, told how he “shares the pain” ­Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry have felt since their daughter vanished aged three in . German police claim they have evidence she is dead.  Leandro added: “For me there were a lot of similarities with the two ­disappearances. I dream of knowing what happened to poor Joana just like I know the McCanns do [about ­Madeleine].If that means finding out they are dead so be it but I obviously wish for a dferent ending. “What I do want is justice done for whoever’s taken her and I don’t feel asI have all or any of the answers.” Joana vanished after leaving a local cafe with milk and a tin of tuna she had just bought. Her murder investigation was led by Goncalo Amaral, the police chief who led the botched probe into ­Madeleine’s disappearance.  He was found to have falsied police ­documents in the Cipriano case and was jailed for  months. Leonor launched a campaign to find her daughter before being made a suspect by Amaral, in the same way doctors Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics, were.Detectives claimed Joao killed Joana after she allegedly caught him having incestuous sex with her mum. Leonor confessed to police over the alleged murder but today insists she is ­innocent. Joao confessed to cutting Joana’s body into pieces and feeding them to pigs. However, he also now claims he had no involvement and said he too was “forced” to confess. Leonor ­withdrew her confession the day after signing it, alleging she was beaten during a two-day ­interrogation.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy

seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept.

These restrictions are severe and place Scotlandrsquos island communities and tourism enterprises out of kilter with the rest of the country.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapseldquoIt will not be financially viable to open most tourism businesses with no tourism customer base and we have ready examples to share of businesses that will be forced to make island staff redundant and that will collapse or go into administration and not survive this pandemic.ldquoMany of these businesses are not just for tourists ndash they play a key part in the le and health of locals year-round, are community hubs and support other businesses through local supply chains. The tourism income makes them viable, and without it they will struggle to survive as business entities - with all the serious socio-economic implications this will bring for the inidual island economies.\"He added: ldquoMany of these businesses have fallen through the cracks in support being made available to date. They are fearful that they will get further into debt and collapse. We cannot overstress the anxiety being experienced as a consequence of these new circumstances.ldquoThe islands are being penalised and we believe unnecessarily.

It only came to light following a BBC investigation last month.Dr Smith said genetic analysis had linked a further three possible cases to the conference, but two have now been discounted while the third ldquoshows similarities with those associated with the conference, but no direct or indirect link to the conference has been established.He added: ldquoAll show similarities with a viral lineage found in continental Europe.ldquoHowever, this particular sub-lineage has not been detected in Scotland since the end of March.ldquoThis suggests that the actions taken by the [infection management team] were successful in curtailing spread and have led to the eradication of this particular viral lineage, with no evidence of any wider outbreak associated with it in Scotland since that time.: Edinburgh doctors see big drop in broken bones from assualts and road collisions since start of CovidIt comes as a study from Hard Medical School suggested that the new virus could have emerged in Wuhan, China as far back as September or October last year, based on a ldquodramatic increase in traffic to the cityrsquos major hospitals around that time, and a spike in queries on a Chinese internet for ldquocertain symptoms that would later be determined as closely associated with the novel coronavirus.China did not formally noty the World Health Organization of the new disease until December .Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that Scotland is continuing to see a ldquoclear downward trend in Covid deaths.

In theory at least. The worry is that,the grim weekly supermarket trip offers any guide, the new normal might feel almost as disturbing as our current lockdown.

And yet, unless there is a surge back to our old ways, the economy will slide even further into the abyss. Itrsquos hard not to feel a moral obligation to help businesses get back on their feet.Some weeks ago, I contemplated what I was most looking forward to doing when we emerged from purdah. Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes. And in one respect at least Irsquom looking forward to making my own mask. In winter I resemble a figure in a John Bellany painting, my nose ice cold and red raw. A fleecy face-covering could save on central heating.Even as the danger of infection diminishes, the sobering reality is that fear will persist for a considerable time. To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost.

Yet the mere fact of being banned from travelling more than five miles from home is what has felt so constricting in recent times, even , like me, yoursquore usually quite happy staying within easy walking distance of your door.As we go through the gradual phases of our staggered release, like a barge inching through a lock, simply knowing that we can go wherever we like will come as a tremendous relief. Who careswe must be home by bedtime  Just glimpsing somewhere dferent will be excitement enough. It marks the restoration of a basic human liberty. And, as our leash ens, so spirits will lt. The invisible cordon sanitaire that has been restraining us in will vanish, and to a large degree our lives will feel like our own again.Yet while we yearn to get back to our old haunts, elements of the crisis have shown a better way, which hopefully will endure. The rise in walking and cycling signals a serious cultural sht. Along with the upturn in home deliveries, it might indicate the beginning of the end for the car. Even where I live, in the country, the air is cleaner, the roads emptier, the birds louder. The outpouring of care and concern shown across the nation for neighbours and those in need has strengthened peoplersquos connection to their community. More of us have been shopping or ordering locally, and discovering whatrsquos on our doorstep. Some have been baking their own bread, or cooking from scratch, and discovering the humdrum but satisfying joys of home le. Looking to the uncertain future, a few are on their way to becoming self-sufficient.As we gradually emerge into a freer existence, carrying hand sanitisers the way Clint Eastwood holstered a Colt , one thing seems certain. We wonrsquot take anything for granted again. The simplest of activities have already assumed a profound signicance. To call something ordinary or normal will soon be the highest terms of praise.

stressing that ldquothe reassurance that there is a summer season for tourism in Scotland will offer a huge comfort and relief to many thousands of businesses.But the alliance has renewed calls for the two-metresocial distancing rule to be reconsidered to help businesses to adapt to the new way of operating.Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, added: ldquoIt remains the case that urgent solutions or alternative measures must be found or taken to overcome the current two-metredistancing restrictions to enable economic viability for many businesses. This is especially true of the capacities on our ferries as it will signicantly impact island economies where tourism is the leblood for so many.ldquoWhilst the package of grant support which has already made available to many small tourism businesses by the UK and Scottish Governments has been hugely welcomed, there remains a good number still in need of immediate grant support to enable them to be in the best possible position to open on  July.ldquoA longer-term support package for the sector will definitely be needed to ensure the survival of many businesses over the coming nine months. Most are reliant on there being an optimum spring, summer and early autumn trading period to cover their costs and fixed overheads in the winter months and recovery projections are still likely to be slow.Earlier at First Ministers Questions,MsSturgeon was pressed by Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles to think again about reducing the social distancing rule to onemetre.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapseShe said: \"Dferent countries use dferent distances ndash some countries use ametre, some countries use ametreand a half, some counties like the UK advise twometres.\"All of the advice I have had here in Scotland at this stage says to me that we should not change the twometres.\"MsSturgeon added: \"As you reduce the distance you do increase the risk of transmission ndash theres also a relationship between the distance and then the time that it is safe for people to be in contact.\"Some countries that have a shorter distance also have dferent requirements in terms of face masks and face coverings.\":Nicola Sturgeon: Relaxing two-metre rule would likely need stricter face covering guidanceMrEwing said he accepted public transport will \"of necessity be constrained because of the requirement to comply with social distancing\" but pledged the Scottish Government will \"make the necessary, practical arrangements to do our very best to meet the challenges\".Chief executive of the Association of Scotlandrsquos Self-Caterers, Fiona Campbell, welcomed the clarity given to businesses and added that \"owing to the nature of self-catering that allows for easier social distancing compared to other accommodation, we are able toto operating sooner than planned, with robust cleaning protocols in place\".She added: ldquoScotlandrsquos self-caterers have grasped the task of preparing to open again and in doing so have created our own stringent and thorough protocols for cleaning our properties which we have shared this with industry stakeholders and the Scottish Government.ldquoWe are ready and able to get Scottish tourism moving again.Andrew McRae, FSBrsquos Scotland policy chairman said the news will give traders \"an opportunity to salvage a share of their summer season\".:CalMac Ferries warns it wont be able to cope with staycation surge amid social distancingHe added:ldquoBut Scottish tourism isnrsquot just a bed for the night. Other businesses in the visitor economy ndash such as tour guides or local galleries ndash can now start making decisions about how and when they should re-open. Tourists will also want places to eat, drink and explore when they get here.Thatrsquos why the plan to re-open Scotland to visitors needs to reflect the breadth of the industry and the views of local communities.Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce added:ldquoThis will be welcome news for so many who are reliant on hospitality and tourism for their livelihoods.:Council set to take over short-term lets in the capital and use them as homeless accommodationldquoThe Scottish Chamber network alone represents over , businesses in the tourism sector which employ over , people, underlining how critical it is for jobs and skills that the sector thrives.ldquoThe Scottish Government has listened but for some it is already toolateand the challenge ahead remains clear.

Looking at excess death rates, more than , people have died at this time this year compared to the same time last year.When asked what had gone wrong, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI think two things ndash one is a paper actually out in Nature, which highlights that around about that time, just before lockdown happened, the first two weeks of March, we probably had , to , infections imported from Italy and Spain, which we just hadnrsquot seen in the surveillance data, until that point.ldquoSo there is much heavier seeding than wersquod expected.He added: ldquoThe key things to determine number of deaths is at what point in your local epidemic you trigger interventions ndash how far in are you when you shut down transmission.ldquoAnd we frankly had underestimated how far into the epidemic this country was, thatrsquos half the reason.ldquoThe second part, which I think would have been more avoidable, is about half of those deaths occurred in care homes.Prof Ferguson continued: ldquoAnd we did all this working under the assumption which was Government policy at the time that care homes would be shielded from infection.He further told the committee: ldquoWe also made a rather optimistic assumption that somehow ndash which was policy ndash that the elderly would be shielded, the most vulnerable would be shielded as the top priority. And that simply failed to happen.Prof Ferguson, whose research helped usher in the lockdown, resigned from his role as a key Government adviser after admitting that he had undermined social distancing rules by reportedly meeting a woman at his home.However, he told the committee he still sits on SPI-M, which advises the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies .Prof Ferguson told the committee that despite border screening at the early stage of the pandemic, probably % of cases imported into the country were missed because checks were not being conducted on people arriving from Europe.Greg Clark, chairman of the committee, asked Prof Fergusonthat was because Sage had advised that it was not necessary to test those people.Prof Ferguson said: ldquoThis is really decisions by the Foreign Office and by the Department of Health and Social Care, not by Sage.ldquoSage recommended that where a country had been identied as having an active transmission, we should check travellers from those countries.He added that the dficulty was that Spain and Italy ndash the source of many infections into the UK ndash had large epidemics before they realised.ldquoWe were just not aware of the scale of transmission in Europe as a whole, Prof Ferguson said.The committee also heard that had the UK had the testing capacity at that stage, then at least screening everybody with symptoms arriving in the country would have given a better impression of where infection was coming from.:Scotlands tourism industry, pubs and restaurants set to re-open for business on July The Imperial College Covid- response team called for a full-scale lockdown in a paper on March  ndash seven days before it was implemented in the UK.When askedhe was disappointed in the delay, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI said earlier, but in retrospect I would have much preferred it to have been taken a week earlier given that many lives would have been saved.Prof Fergusonrsquos comments were put to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty at the daily Downing Street press conference.Sir Patrick said it would be important to look back and see what measures had been most effective, and would be useful in determining what measures to implement in the future,necessary.He added: ldquoSo I think those are important scientic questions to address, and they havenrsquot yet been fully addressed.Prof Whitty said it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak.ldquoI think a iety of dferent people are going to come with dferent answers on the timing question, he said.ldquoPart of the problem that we had at that stage is that we had very limited information about this virus."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmTourism businesses have been told to prepare to reopen from July  — should Scotland move to the third phase on the government#s route map for easing lockdown restrictions.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In that statement there is a lesson and a reason for hope.“Curiosity is a powerful thing, and science is about harnessing curiosity and honing it into the best method we have for acquiring new knowledge and exploring the unknown.“That’s what science is all about, and that’s why we need you to become the scientists of the future!

He did not sayhe still felt additional funding for the health service would have prevented the introduction of the draconian measures.The UUP described his clarication as feeble.MLA Alan Chambers said it made the situation worse because he singularly fails to explain why he said what he said in trying to blame the UK Government for lockdown and he has failed to retract the comments he made.Conor Murphy#s own party leader said, on more than one occasion, that we should be following the World Health Organisation`s advice on lockdown, so his failure to retract his original comments run directly counter to what they were saying. More people being infected would have meant more deaths.”Austerity policies have severely impacted on the capacity of Health and Social Care services, here and where, to respond to the Covid  pandemic. For clarity, lockdown has been absolutely necessary to save lives.— Conor MurphyJune , The Health Minister Robin Swann dismissed Mr Murphy#s suggestion better funding for his department over the years could have avoided a lockdown.The UUP MLA said no health service could have coped with the outbreak no matter how well it was funded and the measures imposed were based on similar responses from around the world. Read More Murphy claries comments after blaming lockdown on Tory austerityThe impact of the lockdown has been immense in Northern Ireland with the economy suffering a major shock with all sectors in a slump. The rate of decline experienced has been the worst in all the UK.Mr Murphy told the BBC#s Good Morning Ulster: The fact we had to go into lockdown is because our health service has suffered from decades of under investment.Read MoreAlex Kane:Opinion Murphy#s new law: Saying wrong thing at the wrong timeHe added: If we had a very robust health service that was well-resourced then it would have been fit to cope with the pandemic.The reason we had to go into lockdown - and people should understand this - is because the health service has been under resourced through austerity cuts for many, many years. So any attempt to restructure the health service is a big challenge as we still suffer from nine years of austerity.Read More Revealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandLater in a tweet he said: Austerity policies have severely impacted on the capacity of Health and Social Care services, here and where, to respond to the Covid- pandemic. For clarity, lockdown has been absolutely necessary to save lives.Health minister Robin Swann said he agreed his department was under resourced but said the only way to manage the spread of the infection in NI was to go into lockdown. He said he took exception to Mr Murphy#s claim they could have coped better had the funds been available.It was not because our health service was not fit to cope. No health service was fit to cope. When we look at the pictures coming out of Italy at the time and New York - which is supposed to be world leading - no health service could have kept going in its day-to-day operations and coped with Covid at the same time.Read More Stormont let the health service down over the last decade – Robin SwannHe added: Our health service has been under resourced and is still under resourced. It#s not [the reason NI went into lockdown].The reason we went into lockdown was how we were to manage the spread of Covid- and that was the method that was used across the world.No health service could have coped.The Finance Minister was called to clary his remarks, with SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole describing them as ‘bizarre and inexplicable. “Years of austerity have undoubtedly degraded the quality of our public services and have placed immense pressure on hard-worked public servants, he said. “But there is, to my knowledge, no evidence suggesting that the reason for the Covid- lockdown is the financing of our health service. It’s baffling, therefore, that the Minister in charge of financing our response to the Covid- pandemic, seems to have a view at odds with most other countries in Europe and the scientic community.Public messaging during a health crisis is important and, on this occasion, it seems to have gone wrong again.Read MoreLisa Smyth:Opinion Swann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSMr Swann has in the past blamed Stormont for running down the health system to an extent a scramble was necessary to find the capacity to cope with the virus.“Vital services have been underfunded, short-term decisions were preferred over long-term planning, dficult choices were ducked, staff were left to feel unappreciated, social care was particularly neglected,” Mr Swann told MLAs in May.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, a former health minister, responded by accusing the Conservative government of having “stripped the Executive of funding over  years”.“The impact that’s had on our health service and our public services are well rehearsed and well known to everybody. Even the fact and the condition that we were in as a health service to be able to respond to Covid- was greatly diminished because of the impact of Tory austerity over many, many years,” she said.Belfast Related ContentNews Analysis PremiumLisa SmythOpinionSwann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSWhen Robin Swann took the job of Health Minister in January, it was dficult to imagine he could face a greater challenge than addressing Northern Ireland#s hospital waiting list shame.GalleryNorthern IrelandRevealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandRobin Swann has published his plan for rebuilding the health service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Most ReadFuneral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in BallymenaFormer Northern Ireland boss Michael O#Neill tests positive for Covid-Coronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths for fourth day as Executive discusses cutting social distancing measureCommunity shock after death of farmer David CrockettNorthern Ireland firms moving jobs to Republic due to Brexit, MP told ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On Friday, the GAA released theirto action procedures, that will allow collective training from Monday, July  and competitive games to commence  days later. There has been mixed reaction over the weekend, due to safety, the ious procedures clubs would need to enforce including the appointment of a Covid Supervisor and Health Questionnaires to be completed for any activity. The County Derry Post conducted an anonymous survey yesterday with adult club players across all codes. googletag.cmd.push Over  responses – from  dferent clubs - were received, with  percent stating they had not read the extensive document outlining the guidelines for ato play. When askedthey wouldto games on July ,  percent indicating that they would do so. Eight percent said they wouldnt, with the reminder said they were unsure. The figures are almost the same for theto training date of Monday, July , with  percent of players saying they will, with  indicating they wont and rest are undecided. Some of the reasons given ranged from not being convinced social distancing would be feasible, working on the front line and the risk it would be to both themselves and their families. googletag.cmd.push One response said that amateur players should not be playing during a global pandemic. The final question on the survey was directed at one of the greatest talking points in recent weeks, whether the GAA shouldve wiped out the entire season. Of the replies,  percent felt the season shouldve been cancelled,  percent had the view that county activity should cease to allow clubs a better window. The remainderwere content with the GAAs stance. Ballerin manager Brian Deighan commended the GAA for their handling of the lockdown, but felt there was now an element of rush with an element of risk. He admits that there is a dference of opinion within his squad, which never exceeds  players. “The younger lads dont see the risk, but older lads in certain jobs or with family members in certain jobs arent keen on it . As a management team, we are dead against it...it is either safe to play or it isnt.” Brian continues by pointing to a comment he saw on social media over the weekend. “Mickey Donnelly hit the nail on the head with a tweet at the weekend, a small club will struggle to resource all these protocols and tests.” Derry CCC are set to finalise their club championship arrangements this week, following meetings to explore the options. Nothing has been confirmed, but they structures are likely to change to allow club players at least one championship game. RELATED - The GAAsto action explained. More...

On Friday, the GAA released theirto action procedures, that will allow collective training from Monday, July  and competitive games to commence  days later. There has been mixed reaction over the weekend, due to safety, the ious procedures clubs would need to enforce including the appointment of a Covid Supervisor and Health Questionnaires to be completed for any activity. The County Derry Post conducted an anonymous survey yesterday with adult club players across all codes. googletag.cmd.push Over  responses – from  dferent clubs - were received, with  percent stating they had not read the extensive document outlining the guidelines for ato play. When askedthey wouldto games on July ,  percent indicating that they would do so. Eight percent said they wouldnt, with the reminder said they were unsure. The figures are almost the same for theto training date of Monday, July , with  percent of players saying they will, with  indicating they wont and rest are undecided. Some of the reasons given ranged from not being convinced social distancing would be feasible, working on the front line and the risk it would be to both themselves and their families. googletag.cmd.push One response said that amateur players should not be playing during a global pandemic. The final question on the survey was directed at one of the greatest talking points in recent weeks, whether the GAA shouldve wiped out the entire season. Of the replies,  percent felt the season shouldve been cancelled,  percent had the view that county activity should cease to allow clubs a better window. The remainderwere content with the GAAs stance. Ballerin manager Brian Deighan commended the GAA for their handling of the lockdown, but felt there was now an element of rush with an element of risk. He admits that there is a dference of opinion within his squad, which never exceeds  players. “The younger lads dont see the risk, but older lads in certain jobs or with family members in certain jobs arent keen on it . As a management team, we are dead against it...it is either safe to play or it isnt.” Brian continues by pointing to a comment he saw on social media over the weekend. “Mickey Donnelly hit the nail on the head with a tweet at the weekend, a small club will struggle to resource all these protocols and tests.” Derry CCC are set to finalise their club championship arrangements this week, following meetings to explore the options. Nothing has been confirmed, but they structures are likely to change to allow club players at least one championship game. RELATED - The GAAsto action explained. More...

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band. The compere was Joseph Caher.Woodgrange Platoon Home Guard presented The Lilac Ribbon by Downpatrick born playwright Lynn Doyle in the Woodgrange Orange Hall on Friday, January , .The Whip Hand was performed by the Stella Maris Players in the Parochial Hall, Saul, on Sunday, May , .The Bryansford Players staged The Rale True Doctor and Professor Tim in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Bryansford, on Sunday, April , , and in St Maryrsquos Hall, Newcastle, on Sunday and Monday, April  and .The Pikemen Orsquo the Ards, described as ldquothe grand Irish drama in five acts, was presented in Dunsford Hall on Sunday, April , , by the Cruachan Cowey Dramatic Club, with Irish selections by the Silver Star Band, Portaferry.With television, the internet and computer games there appears to be less interest today in local drama groups.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

The centre is also coordinating the creation of a VisitDownpatrick website, he remarked.Dr Campbell said St Patrick provided a ldquounique selling point for our area and and an overall brand.He added: ldquoAs this is potentially a year of two winters, we have asked the council to revert to their  contributions to the centre to help us survive and be able to change direction.ldquoThis means giving the centre a little more, particularly because as a small charity in a big building we have not been able to get any of the funding from government made available to other groups and organisations.ldquoIf tourism, as the most important part of our economy in mid Down is to not just survive but thrive we need to be armed with not just a shield, but a sword to fight this battle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Climbing to top of Mount Everest  ","story":"MOUNT Everest, , feet, or , metres, of awe-inspiring, dficult, adventurous, dangerous climbing. Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her.

They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

But, despite, a large amount of public land and pathways available to link these community assets, these attractions are poorly connected.Mr Hazzard said he has asked the local authority to ldquourgently look at rediscovering the public value of disused railway lines, abandoned riverside paths and overgrown public spaces in developing a Downpatrick greenway project that would help breath new le into redundant community infrastructure.ldquoLinking these wonderful local attractions would also help create exciting new public spaces where people can relax, enjoy nature or exercise, he continued.ldquoDelivering a greenway initiative would not only represent an exciting investment in our local tourism offering, but help create multiple, long-term employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, providing a strong  to build a much-needed, vibrant weekend and evening economy in the town centre.Mr Hazzard believes that developing greenways has the potential to make a huge dference to the lives of local people by providing the opportunity to enjoy traffic free access to fresh air and exercise.He is also confident that the initiative would encourage more workers and children to commute to work and school on foot or by bicycle and help provide a vital leisure resource for local people and visitors alike for generations to come. ldquoThe Covid- pandemic and subsequent lockdown restrictions has exposed the importance of community trails and public spaces to our collective well-being as a society, Mr Hazzard continued.ldquoOver recent weeks, our country roads and parks have been full of people seeking respite from isolation in the green, community infrastructure that ordinarily binds our communities together.However, it is clear that this infrastructure lags well behind many comparative regional, national and international locations.ldquoThankfully, however, unlike most major infrastructure projects which can be quite expensive and take the best part of a decade to complete, community green infrastructure can be delivered much quicker and at much less of a cost to the public purse.Mr Hazzard says he is confident that a new greenway project in Downpatrick represents an ldquoexciting opportunity on so many levels and deserves serious consideration.He added: ldquoI look forward to discussing this proposal with senior council management in the weeks ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11406080.jpg","title":"stay safe meeting group latest lockdown rules","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that in EnglandIn ScotlandIn WalesAnd in Northern IrelandEstablish ground rulesKeep everything outdoors where possibleKeep your distanceAvoid sharingMasks, wipes and sanitiserThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: PA WireArticle  of the Detention of TerroristsOrder  authorises a secretary of state, minister of state or under secretary of state to sign an ICO. As minister of state, I was one of the ministers authorised by that order to sign, and thus to make, ICOs. The Supreme Court’s judgment does not say which minister of state signed the ICO in relation to Gerry Adams. As I say, it may be that my signature was on some of the ICOs made in this period, although they could have been signed by David Windlesham or Paul Channon. Most likely, they would have been signed by David Windlesham as he was specically assigned by Mr Whitelaw to oversee security issues, although we all worked together as a team on all aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration. I note that it was David Windlesham who on  December  moved the motion in the House of Lords that the  Order be approved. He remarked then that “applications for interim custody orders are by no means automatically granted by the secretary of state.Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the UK and former Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland, who read out the unanimous judgement in the Gerry Adams case. Photo: Supreme Court PA WireThere is a thorough process of scrutiny before he, or anyone on his behalf, decides whether or not to sign one at all.”It is clear to me that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted the nature and scope of the  Order. The court misunderstands the signicance of Article , which specically provided for a minister of state or undersecretary of state to sign an ICO in the name of the secretary of state.This provision was understood by government in making the order and in exercising it, and by Parliament in the debates about whether to approve the order, to authorise the minister of state or under secretary of state to decide whether an ICO should be made. In so doing, weacted in the name of the secretary of state, who was responsible for the Northern Ireland Officeand the ministerial team and who was, of course, closely involved in many ICO decisions himself, as well as directing which ministers should oversee which aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration.The fundamental failure of the Supreme Court’s judgment is its total misunderstanding of the nature of ministerial and departmental government and methods of operating. A junior minister on duty at Stormont is in effect the persona of Her Majesty’s government and is thereby empowered to act for and as the secretary of state in the latter’s absence. And the secretary of state was often unavoidably absent. In relation to Northern Ireland, it was inherent in the nature of direct rule that the secretary of state had to be frequently in London – in Parliament or the cabinet – and that his responsibilities would often have to be exercised by a junior minister on the ground.On the weekends, one of us was always the duty minister. One minister always had to be available to Parliament, including to answer urgent questions. And those of us who were members of the House of Commons had also toto London frequently to vote .When the order was made, on  November , and when it was approved by Parliament in December , it was certainly contemplated that there would often be cases in which an ICO would need to be made by the minister of state or under secretary of state rather than by the secretary of state himself. The order clearly provides for this to happen. The high number of ICOs that the government anticipated would have to be made, and were in practice made, also helps explain why the order provides that junior ministers may order temporary detention. The Supreme Court’s assertion that it would not have been dficult for the secretary of state to consider each case personally and to make each ICO himself simply does not match the reality.As it happens, almost all signing of ICOs, where the actual signing of the document took place in Stormont Castle, was discussed directly with other ministers and usually with the secretary of state by telephone or message,he had to be in London or his constituency home in Penrith.The secretary of state could not always be directly involved and even when involved in some cases it would often be the minister of state or under secretary of state, in Stormont, who had reviewed the grounds for making an ICO in detail and who was satisfied that an ICO should be made.The minister on duty in Stormont was fully entitled to act in the secretary of state’s name. Other ministers were consulted, to the extent possible, not because this was what the law required, asthe junior minister were simply the mouthpiece of the secretary of state , but because that is how any team of ministers, operating as a team, would act in relation to important matters with political implications for which the secretary of state would have to accept constitutional responsibility.In any case, in relation to Gerry Adams one can be absolutely sure that it would have been discussed most fully and confirmed by the secretary of state before the ICO was made.The political salience and security implications of detaining Mr Adams would have made this unavoidable.I do not know whether there is a record of the secretary of state’s involvement in this case or any other case in which his signature does not appear on the ICO itself. The Supreme Court’s judgment implies not.This may be unsurprising in view of how ICOs were often made, which is to say by a minister of state or under secretary of state in Stormont, with the secretary of state often consulted by message or telephone from London or Penrith, but without a record of that involvement necessarily being kept or now being available. There would have been no reason, and perhaps no capacity, to record the secretary of state’s personal involvement, save in those cases where he himself signed the ICO, because Article  authorised the minister of state to sign the ICO and this signature had itself to be sufficient to authorise detention on the ground in Northern Ireland.But it is a travesty to conclude that because ministers complied with the terms of the  Order, and did not go above and beyond it to somehow record the secretary of state’s involvement, the ICO must now be quashed and the detention ruled unlawful.It is quite startling to see the Supreme Court reasoning that the prosecution had failed in Gerry Adams’s case to prove that the secretary of state had personally authorised his detention. The shape of the  Order makes very clear that an ICO signed by a minister of state or snder secretary of state is the same as an ICO signed by the secretary of state himself and authorises detention. It would have been utterly unworkable for the Royal Ulster Constabulary to have refused to detain suspected terrorists unless and until proof had been provided that an ICO signed by the minister had also been personally considered by the secretary of state. Or for commissioners determining whether there should be continuing detention to have held that they did not have jurisdiction unless and until the secretary of state had provided evidence that he had personally considered whether to make the ICO in question.This would have made the scheme of the  Order simply unworkable. The Supreme Court’s reading of the  Order was not what government intended, or understood, or what Parliament approved. The whole point of the signature requirement in Article  is to make clear who is authorised to make an ICO and thus whose signature on the face of an ICO makes it lawful to detain the person in question.The making of ICOs in -, which the Supreme Court has now denounced as unlawful, was entirely in line with the law, with the wishes of Parliament, with normal ministerial practice and with the immediate security needs of protecting the public from acts of appalling violence and bloodshed . Like Professor Ekins and Sir Stephen, I take the case for legislation to overturn the effect of the Supreme Court’s judgment – to make clear that ICOs signed by a minister of state or under secretary of state were lawful — to be overwhelming. In so legislating, Parliament would be reaffirming its clear, obvious and original intentions and the absolutely normal practices of departmental governance and ministerial responsibility.• Lord Howell of Guildford is the last surviving member of the ministerial team in the Northern Ireland Office, with responsibility under the Detention of TerroristsOrder .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
