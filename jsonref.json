We’re learning to live with Covid.’The move will see Covid-19 treated in a similar way to other infectious diseases such as flu, with people encouraged to stay at home if they were ill.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: ‘We would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease.’The prospect of the removal of the remaining restrictions, which also include the ability for councils to order the closure of premises where the virus could be spreading, has caused unease for some of those most at risk from the disease.Phillip Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said ending the restrictions will ‘heap yet more worry and confusion on thousands of immunocompromised people’. James Taylor from disability equality charity Scope, said: ‘Scrapping self-isolation will mean that some disabled people will be feeling very anxious and could potentially be placed in situations that could prove deadly.’The Government\u0027s plan is expected to set out further information for vulnerable groups but officials also believe ‘cutting edge treatments’ will also mitigate some of the risks.Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said while there were grounds for optimism in the overall data on deaths and hospital admissions, he had concerns about the vulnerable and people who may not have responded as well to the vaccines.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading said: ‘If the requirement on infected iniduals to isolate at home is lifted as indicated, it will be an experiment which will either be shown to be very brave or very stupid, but nobody knows for sure what the result will be.’Professor Peter Openshaw, who advises the Government on Covid through the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said he would be ‘very reluctant’ to suggest this was the end of Covid, adding it was ‘still a very nasty virus’.Figures published on Wednesday show Covid-19 infection levels have risen in three of the four UK nations, with only Wales showing a fall.Scotland and Northern Ireland both saw an increase last week in the number of people in private households likely to have coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

So the Government is going to step in to directly help people manage those extra costs,\u0027 Mr Sunak said.The policy had been delayed by weeks of internal wrangling with Boris Johnson and the Cabinet, after many ministers pushed for the £12billion national insurance raid to be delayed or axed.Labour accused Mr Sunak of a \u0027puny\u0027 response and a \u0027buy now pay later\u0027 approach, arguing he is merely delaying the pain.He was also assailed by some Tory MPs, with Peter Bone branding him a \u0027socialist\u0027 in an extraordinary barb.Mr Sunak said: \u0027We are delivering that support in three different ways. First we will spread the worst of the extra costs of this year\u0027s energy price shock over time.\u0027This year all domestic electricity customers will receive an up front discount on their bills worth £200.‘Energy suppliers will apply the discount on people’s bills from October with the Government meeting the cost in full, that discount will automatically be repaid from people’s bills in equal £40 instalments over the next five years.’Alarmingly many members of the Monetary Policy Committee pushed for a bigger rates increase to 0.75 per cent. Investors are anticipating the level will reach 1.5 per cent by the end of the year.Governor Andrew Bailey said it had been a ‘close call’ but stressed there was only likely to be ‘modest’ further increases in the coming months.He said the Bank had not acted because the economy is ‘roaring away’, but to counter the risk that inflation is becoming ‘ingrained’ domestically. The new peak is two percentage points higher than was forecast in November.Experts are warning the cost-of-living crisis could last years, with ministers hitting the panic button amid fears it will be even more toxic to the Government than Partygate.Meanwhile, Labour has renewed its demand for a windfall tax on energy companies after Shell recorded an eye-watering £12billion profit in just three months."},{"url":null,"title":"West Ham stands Kurt Zouma pressure mounts club drop him","story":"Share this articleShare this articleWest Ham ace Kurt Zouma filmed KICKING and slapping his pet cat in horrific videoWest Ham ace Kurt Zouma issues grovelling apology over horrifying video showing him slapping and kicking cat"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris eyes Samantha Panther team","story":"Share this articleBoris Johnson eyes ex-royal aide Samantha Cohen for gatekeeper | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Cressida Dick REFUSES stand thinks shes leading real transformation","story":"Share this articleExclusive: IOPC probing former officer’s claims that police had sex with suspect at Charing Cross station | LondonWorld"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51dff5c62939b576697c7ad8c81d64c63033dd13/0_477_7380_4428/master/7380.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e71a268d47103160315ca1c01a1f8c48","title":"unilever deals prices inflation astrazeneca stock markets us inflation economy covid business live","story":"The consumer goods giant says that it expects ‘very high’ cost pressures in the first half of this year - as it wrestles with higher raw material prices, shipping charges and packaging costs. Unilever says in today annual results that its input costs could surge by at least €3.5bn during 2022. Pricing will “continue to be strong”, with some impact on volume as a result, it predicts. That’s going to be a blow to household shopping bills this year, as Unilever produces such a range of goods (from food and cleaning products to personal care and ice cream). But even with price rises, Unilever’s profitability is expected to be squeezed by cost pressures. Typically, it might move the rate in quarter-point increments -- but January’s hot inflation report might prompt a faster hike. Simon Harvey, Head of FX Analysis at Monex Europe says:  Victoria Scholar, head of Investment at interactive investor, says: That’s a measure of rental prices, or how much a homeowner would have to pay to rent their own property. But overall, the increase in prices is broad-based, with virtually all component of the inflation report showing increases over the past 12 months.  Here are some key moves: That was the era when Fed chair Paul Volcker raised US interest rates dramatically high to squeeze inflation out of the economy, driving up inflation and pushing the US into recession.That’s higher than forecast, and shows that inflationary pressures are continuing to weigh on the US recovery. As well as hurting Americans, it increases the chances that the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates sharply through 2022, as it looks to get a grip on rising prices. The Commission warned that the EU economy entered 2022 “on a weaker note than previously projected”, meaning the recovery will take longer. The resurgence of the pandemic last autumn and the exponential spread of Omicron put renewed strains on healthcare systems and an unprecedented surge of workplace absences in many EU countries, the Commission points out. Supply chain disruption, and the surge in energy prices, are also hitting production. The EC expects inflationary pressures to moderate towards the end of the year, but it also warns that price rises are broadening,  "},{"url":null,"title":"explainer how does the rise in irish prices compare with other eu countries","story":"Traffic on the M50 Dublin. Prices have increased sharply in transport, driven by the impact of higher energy costs on petrol and diesel.  Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Ireland’s inflation experience over the past year is broadly in line with what is happening across the EU. Energy prices have been the main culprit as the price of oil and then gas surged and electricity cost rose as a result. Looking at the December, the last full set of data available, annual inflation in the euro zone was 5 per cent versus 5.7 per cent in Ireland, using the harmonised measure which allows comparison. The graph shows how inflation here has tracked the rest of Europe in recent years.For Ireland and the rest of Europe soaring energy prices are by far the most significant factor, with the housing and energy category of the inflation measure rising 11.8 per cent in Ireland and 9.8 per cent across the euro zone. The energy component of this category has risen by 25 per cent plus in both Ireland and the EU year on year. Rents are also included in this category and Irish rents rose 7.7 per cent year on year according to the CSO– Irish rental growth has been sharply outpacing the EU average in recent year, with rents here close to 70 per cent higher since 2010, compared to a euro zone average of around 15 per cent.The other area where prices have increased sharply is transport, again driven by the impact of higher energy costs on petrol and diesel. The transport category in Ireland has increased by 18 per cent over the past year, compared to an EU average of 10.4 per cent.With petrol and diesel prices rising across Europe the higher rate in this category in Ireland seems to relate to other issues such as car prices.Elsewhere inflationary pressures are much lower both in Ireland and across the EU, though recent months have seen food prices starting to tick up and a knock on from the impact of blocked up supply chains on a range of other products, notably household electrical goods and cars. Food prices across Europe have been increasing more rapidly than in Ireland, perhaps a sign of things to come, while there are also signs of a bounceback of hotel and restaurant costs after the pandemic.The other issue for Ireland is the point where we start this inflationary cycle. The actual level of prices here,according to Eurostat, is the joint highest in the EU alongside Denmark for a basket of 2,000 consumer goods and services. Prices here are 40 per cent above the EU average. So Ireland is already a relatively expensive place to live.

Photograph: iStockCalls for a blanket right to remote working are “not realistic”, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.However, Mr Varadkar acknowledged there were probably too many reasons for employer to refuse a request for remote working.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was addressing questions raised on the The Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2021 by Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin in the Dáil on Thursday, which he described as being written with employers in mind and not workers.Mr Ó Ríordáin said under this Bill a worker had to wait 26 weeks before they could request permission to work remotely and then potentially wait a further 12 months for an answer from the employer, “effectively the length of a pregnancy”.“The grounds for refusal from the employer are so wide that it effectively makes the Bill meaningless,” he added.In response, Mr Varadkar said he was willing to change the Bill and make it “fit for purpose”.“Thirteen reasons might be too many, it’s more than any other country has. It probably is too many and the self-assessment tool might be too complicated. Six months might be too long,” he said.Feedback on legislationMr Varadkar said he was happy to receive feedback on the proposed legislation and take part in further engagement with trade unions.He said his department was looking at the many issues that have been raised and said he was taking further advice from the Attorney General.“We’re very keen to enhance rights and entitlements for workers. We also need to ensure a balanced approach that is fair and affordable for employers as well and ensures that services provided to the public are not diminished,” he said.The Tánaiste said that Ibec had indicated they “did not like” the Bill either at a meeting on Wednesday.“So while the unions may have been louder on the airwaves in criticising proposals, the employer side of it are equally critical,” he said.Mr Varadkar said there were good aspects of the Bill including the requirement for an employer to have a remote-working policy while working from home had been in response in a pandemic, and there had been problems.Mr Ó Ríordáin said remote working had brought a lot of benefits to Irish society, in particular “families who wanted to embrace it”.He said “it doesn’t suit everybody and not everybody wants it” but added that female participation in the workforce had increased by 3.5 per cent over the course of the pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"leaving britons syria weakens national security","story":"The threat from the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) may have receded since the collapse of its territorial Caliphate in 2019, but it has not disappeared. There remain thousands of active supporters in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and some countries in the West. The appeal of the terrorist group is based on inidual grievance, political inequalities, and social isions that remain prevalent as they were during the movement’s initial rise. In the last three years countries have done much to try to understand and counter the ISIS appeal, as well as to identify and disrupt its members. Although other issues, such as tensions with Russia, may rightly demand more immediate attention, there are policy decisions that the UK and other governments could take to ensure that the current resurgence of ISIS does not begin to affect our own domestic security. It may seem on the surface that the death this month of the ISIS leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, and the ending of the prolonged ISIS attempt to spring its members from a Kurdish-run prison in Hasakah, north east Syria, are signs that ISIS is on a losing streak but many observers would argue the opposite.  The prolonged and determined prison attack was very much in the style of previous ISIS breaking-the-walls campaigns designed to strengthen the group by freeing large numbers of trained fighters. And the death of Qurayshi, though a major blow, will make little difference to the reach and capability of ISIS. The group is believed by UN experts to have a war chest of around $50 million and some 10,000 supporters across Iraq and Syria. Another leader will emerge, perhaps one more able and visible. We can reasonably expect further attacks. In the meantime, there have been few attempts to resolve the problems in north east Syria that ISIS has exploited so skilfully. One of the greatest of these is the continued detention of thousands of people captured fleeing the collapse of the caliphate in poorly secured prisons and camps. These detention camps for women and children have immense propaganda value for ISIS and serve as incubators for the group’s violent ideology. A report published today by MPs and Peers that I provided evidence for reminds our leaders that the decision to leave British nationals in detention in north east Syria increases and prolongs the terrorist threat to British domestic security. The number is not great, perhaps around 20 families in all, but they live among some 60,000 others in conditions that offer few if any of the educational and social tools needed for reintegration. Their influences and connections are almost universally negative as radical women take more control of the camps and resentment builds towards the home states that refuse to repatriate them. The prospect for the male children is to wait until they are old enough to be transferred to the Kurdish run prisons for ISIS fighters such as the one in Hasakah. Once there, they will be even less exposed to positive influences. The only way to reduce the potential threat from British nationals in these detention facilities is to repatriate them and either prosecute them or reintegrate them into society, working within a rule of law framework. This will not be straightforward, but that should not prevent progress. Several Western countries have already started down this road: in the nine months to June last year, well over 300 children and over 50 women were repatriated to 13 different countries. As experience grows, the task should get easier. The UK’s myopic, incoherent, and increasingly isolated approach is not so much Global Britain as it is insecure island. The UK enjoys considerable influence on Western counter-terrorist policy, but we are falling behind and missing an opportunity to study first hand the drivers of international terrorism in this country. It is not credible to argue that the Kurdish authorities are somehow better equipped to deal with our citizens. They certainly have fewer resources and less counter-terrorism experience than we do, and we should accept responsibility for assessing the risk that the British families who lived under ISIS pose now or may do in the future and deal with them accordingly. We should do everything to demonstrate our belief in inidual human rights and freedoms. This belief, especially if put into consistent practice, is surely the best and most effective way to counter the ISIS arguments of discrimination and despair.Richard Barrett is a former Director of Global Counter Terrorism Operations at MI6More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson may not quit if fined by police over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39How John Major\u0026#39s 30-year feud with Boris Johnson led to his latest savage attack on PMSir Keir Starmer blames Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Savile slur for mob harassmentRussia\u0026#39s top diplomat mocks \u0026#39deaf\u0026#39 Liz Truss at testy joint appearance in MoscowDuke of Cambridge calls out fast fashion as he promotes Earthshot prizeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nuclear fusion could transform world","story":"Piercing the gloom surrounding the shift to non-carbon energy sources and the transitional costs involved is a glimmer of light. We have seen it before, but it has invariably been snuffed out. It is nuclear fusion, the Holy Grail of power generation, the same process that fuels the sun and other stars.Scientists have been trying for 50 years to replicate the intense heat required to bring about the molecular reaction necessary for fusion. There was a moment when two researchers claimed they had discovered cold fusion, which would have solved the world’s energy problems overnight, but it was not to be.While the prospect of achieving fusion has always been at least 30 years away, there have been indications recently that serious advances are now being made. The Jet laboratory, near Oxford, has announced what it called a “major breakthrough” by significantly increasing the amount of energy it can create from a fusion reaction.While it remains tiny – sufficient only to boil 60 kettles – it is double what was previously achieved. “We’ve demonstrated that we can create a mini star and hold it there for five seconds and get high performance, which really takes us into a new realm,” said one scientist.Nor is this a flash in the pan. Recent results at MIT in Boston have encouraged scientists there to conclude that nuclear fusion can be used to power electricity grids within the next decade. Investors, including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, are ploughing billions into funding the development of nuclear fusion energy machines in the expectation of early returns.

She is on a separate series of engagements from the Prince of Wales.It has not yet been confirmed whether the Prince has seen the Queen in person in recent days. She returned to Windsor Castle on Monday. He spent his working day at the castle on Tuesday, holding investitures. The announcement of the Prince’s positive test was made just after midday, around 12 minutes before Prince Charles, 73, was due to arrive in Winchester on a visit to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Staff there were only informed a few moments before.More than 1,000 people were gathered behind barriers in the city’s Jewry Street, waiting to see the Prince unveil a new statue of Licoricia of Winchester, a prominent Jewish moneylender who was murdered in 1277 during a period of antisemitism in the reign of Edward I that culminated in the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290.The Queen’s representative in Hampshire, the Lord Lieutenant Nigel Atkinson, told the crowd, who groaned with disappointment when he relayed the news. It is the second time the heir to the throne, 73, has contracted coronavirus, after he fell ill in March 2020 when he said he had been lucky to have suffered only mild symptoms.He spent seven days in self-isolation at his Birkhall home in Scotland before resuming his duties.The development comes just days after the Queen marked her Platinum Jubilee by expressing her sincere wish that the Duchess of Cornwall would be Queen Camilla at Charles\u0027s side when he is one day King.The Duchess, meanwhile, carried on with her engagements on Thursday, visiting Paddington Haven, a sexual assault referral centre in West London, where she met former Love Island star Zara McDermott and discussed her experience of revenge porn and assault.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson may not quit if fined by police over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39How John Major\u0026#39s 30-year feud with Boris Johnson led to his latest scathing attack on PMSir Keir Starmer blames Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Savile slur for mob harassmentRussia\u0026#39s top diplomat mocks \u0026#39deaf\u0026#39 Liz Truss at testy joint appearance in MoscowDuke of Cambridge calls out fast fashion as he promotes Earthshot prizeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"free covid lateral flow tests","story":"Free Covid lateral flow tests will continue - but end date could be confirmed in weeksThe free tests will carry on beyond self-isolation rules being axed on February , Downing Street has confirmed. But they will be axed at some point, and the timescale could become much clearer by the end of the monthThe government has previously said free tests will be ended at some point in the future Image: Matt Cardy Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsCovid lateral flow tests will continue to be free beyond February  despite all domestic Covid laws being axed. Downing Street confirmed people will not yet have to pay for the rapid tests, in order to give people confidence to go out and see friends and family.But the Mirror understands a timescale for phasing out free testing could be addressed in a “living with Covid” document, to be unveiled by Boris Johnson on February .The government has previously said free tests will be ended at some point in the future, and leaked documents last month suggested the switchover could happen in June.Papers seen by Reuters claim the timetable was due to be earlier in  - but was pushed back to the summer due to the Omicron iant.According to the document, shared between health agencies to prepare scenarios, officials are working on the basis that an online ordering system should be ready for Brits to order paid-for tests from the end of June.  But that could move againthe virus throws another curve ball into the works, an official said. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. Boris Johnson today announced he plans to end all domestic legal restrictions in England on February , a month earlier than planned.That means for the first time in almost two years, England will have no legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive for Covid-. The legal change will also end powers which councils had under the Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used. The announcement has raised questions over the future of the £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid While isolation will not be a legal requirement, Downing Street said today: “We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. It is understood no final decisions have been made over the future of the £ payment, and it will be considered by the government next week. The living with Covid plan is also likely to make a statement on the future of the multi-billion pound contact tracing system, which was largely outsourced to private firms. Mr Johnson told MPs: “It is my intention toon the first day after the half term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid. “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we’ll be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a full month early.” Mandatory self-isolation was already scrapped last year for close contacts of Covid cases. However, people who test positive for the virus must still go into self-isolation for five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Unions blasted the decision, saying it would leave low-income workers and schools high and dry - while Covid bereaved families blasted the PM when  people died in the last  hours. UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea said: “Everybody wants to get back to normal, but Covid risks haven’t disappeared. This is going too far, way too soon. “Infections are still re in schools. Large numbers of pupils and staff are off. Allowing a prematurecould lead to a further jump in infections and disrupt learning for thousands more.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s also vital that ministers fix our broken sick pay system once and for all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship. “It beggars belief that millions still don’t have access to decent sick pay.” Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London and a member of New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said he would be very reluctant to say that the pandemic was in any way over.” Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: The Prime Minister might wish that this disease was no more dangerous than the flu, but the reality is that he is throwing the most vulnerable in our society to the wolves.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On the desk in front of him - from where he read out quiz questions to teams across the building - is what appears to be champagne and a half-eaten packet of crisps. Mr Johnson was accused of personally breaking Covid laws by hosting the festive event after the Mirror revealed last year that it had taken place. At the time London was under Tier  regulations banning any social mixing between two or more people from dferent households.  Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Just two days after the Mirroraposs initial story, the PM said: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules. But the Christmas quiz is not one of the dozen No  gatherings under investigation by police. This is despite a smaller festive quiz held in the Cabinet Office just two days later being looked at. One Covid laws expert said that Scotland Yard should now add the Downing Street Christmas quiz to the list of events it is probing. Barrister Adam Wagner told The Mirror: The previous photograph of the Prime Minister showed what could have been a meeting briefly interrupted by a Zoom call. However, the new photograph shows four people with alcohol and food, as well as a Christmas hat and tinsel, which suggests a Christmas party. This was held at a time when indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned and the Government had told people they must not have a Christmas party. The top lawyer added: In light of the new evidence it now makes no sense for this gathering not to be investigated by the police given that an almost identical gathering in the Cabinet Secretary Simon Caseaposs office two dayaposs later is being investigated. In the new image, Mr Johnson appears to be putting a badge on his suit jacket.  Later that evening, No  pins were distributed to Downing Street staff as a Christmas present from the PM. Downing Street has insisted the event was a “virtual quiz”, but admitted “those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.” Labour MP Fabian Hamilton raised the photo in PMQs - and contrasted the merriment to a constituent who was unable to have visits from her family while having cancer treatment. He said: For the sake of my constituent and the sacrices she made, will the PM be referring this party to the police as itaposs not one of the parties being investigated  But the PM hit back, saying: He is completely in error. He later said the event had been submitted for investigation. Former No aide Dominic Cummings warned: Thereaposs waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat. No pointed out the event itself had already been considered by Scotland Yard, which decided not to investigate it further. But the PM’s Press Secretary could not say whether the newly-revealed photo had been sent to the Met, saying: “I’m not aware of that and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment”. Of Sue Gray, the Press Secretary added: “She has had access to all information that is relevant and required.” Asked what was happening in the picture, she said: Weaposve talked about this one before, it is a virtual quiz. The Mirror revealed last year that dozens of staff had spent the evening huddling in groups around their office computers rather than dialling in from home. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. Sources said staff had knocked back fizz, wine and beer - and some stayed in Number  socialising and drinking for hours after the quiz finished at .pm. Team names included Professor Quiz Whitty, Next Slide Please, Weaposve Been Clear”, “The  Masketeers” and Hands, Face, First Place - a reference to the slogan introduced to encourage social distancing and mask wearing.  The Mirror also revealed an email showing organisers had planned days in advance for some staff to enjoy the quiz in person, from the office. A senior official even urged staff, including teams from the PMaposs private office, the policy unit and the press office, to leave No  through the back door at the end of the night. Mr Johnson has spent the last few days trying to shore up support after mass resignations from No  last week raised further questions about his authority. Downing Street is hoping his defensive mini-reshuffle to promote loyalists - and the promise of a bigger reshuffle in early summer - will be enough to keep mutinous Tory MPs at bay. But many Tories are privately saying they are waiting for the result of the Met investigation and the full Sue Gray report to decide whether to trigger a confidence vote. The PMaposs allies have claimed that he will not resign evenhe is fined by the politan Police for breaching Covid rules. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror: “If Sue Gray finds he lied to parliament unequivocally, or depending what action police take - that’s it. Either of those two things would be terminal.

Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves.

The disparity in achievement for the neediest pupils has not improved since , according to a report by the Education Policy Institutetoday.

The proportion of pupils who were always disadvantaged - those on free school meals for % of their schooling - had also risen from % of all disadvantaged students in  to % in . The largest grade gaps in  were seen in Knowsley , Blackpool , Salford , Derbyand Sheffield . Areas with the largest disadvantage gaps were more likely to have a high proportion of pupils in long-term poverty, and for several areas, over half of their disadvantaged pupils fell into this group, such as: Kirklees , Sunderland , Halton , Tower Hamlets , Middlesbrough , Knowsley , Kingston-Upon-Hull , and Hartlepool . Report co-author Emily Hunt said: “Our research shows that despite government policy interventions, there has been a decade of failure to improve the relative outcomes of students in long-term poverty – with these students still trailing their better off peers by over a full grade and a half at GCSE. Not only has this education gap failed to narrow since , but the proportion of poorer students falling into long-term poverty is now on the rise. To reverse this tide of stagnating social mobility, the government must do more to address the fundamental drivers of deep-rooted educational inequalities, including poverty. Teaching unions warned that children from disadvantaged backgrounds had been left behind by the Government over the last decade. Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said the report was a verdict on the dismal record of governments over the last decade and more.Since , we have had years of rhetoric and precious little effective action, she said. Worsening poverty has had what the EPI report is right to call a aposdecisiveapos impact on the education of children and young people. . million children - or nine in a classroom of  - are living in poverty. This speaks of untold hardship endured theand breadth of the UK. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said children from disadvantaged backgrounds were victims of a decade of underfunding and neglect. He said: This report shows clearly that it is not the pandemic that has most impacted disadvantaged students but the years of government failure to address the fundamental issues creating disadvantage. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: Ministers cannot disown the legacy of  years of failed Conservative policies.The Government’s newly proclaimed focus on the communities hit hardest by their policies amounts to a recycling of old ideas that have failed to deliver for a generation of young people. It comes as nearly three-quarters of teachers said poorer areas should get more catch-up cash. A poll of more than , teachers found % said the Government should invest extra funding in all schools as part of its levelling-up agenda, but that it should weight this towards schools serving disadvantaged areas. The figure rose to % for teachers in poorer schools, the survey carried out by Teacher Tapp for charity Teach First showed. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Since , we have narrowed the attainment gap between students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers at every stage of education up to the pandemic. “We are committed to levelling up opportunities for all, and last week set out plans to ensure we give every child and adult the education and skills they need to fulfil their potential, no matter where they live. “Our new Education Investment Areas will target support where education outcomes have been weakest – including Knowsley, Blackpool and Salford. We are also investing £.bn next year in the pupil premium so schools can specically help those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and much of the support from our £bn education recovery plan is aimed at those who need it most.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsGCSEs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It came after Ms Coffey was slammed for failing to pledge any new help for the poorest to afford energy bills.That was despite Citizens Advice warning poor Brits are “already drowning” with food bank demand at an “all time record”.  The charity’s Morgan Wild told MPs a £ pledge had not “grasped the challenge” and more help is needed “over the coming months”. He said: “Over the past month Citizens Advice has seen a record demand since the pandemic began of people coming to us for advice. “We’re seeing all time records for crisis support - referrals for food banks and other charitable support - and record numbers for fuel debts.” Yet Ms Coffey said: “There’s already been a signicant increase into the level of support, I’m not aware any more plans are there. That’s not my decision.” She distanced herself from the decision, saying: “I think they think the £bn, the Chancellor thinks £bn of support to people in the country is a substantial element.” Ms Coffey also rebuffed calls from the IFS think tank to lt benefits by more than .% in April - which is a below-inflation rise.  She said: “Sometimes that will be up, sometimes that will be down.” Ms Coffey was also unable to answer a series of other questions about welfare policy. The Cabinet minister said she either did not recall some details or was being asked about other departmental briefs. But Mr Coyle said it was really disappointing” and “embarrassing” adding: “There was a rumour the Secretary of State is going to resign. Is that the reason you canapost answer any questions today, because youaposve got one foot out the door  Ms Coffey snapped: “No, donapost be ridiculous Neil. “You know,you want to bring up gossip, I could bring up other stuff that happened downstairs.” Committee chairman Stephen Timms added: “The lack of detail that the Secretary of State was able to give us on what the Government is doing to support the many people currently struggling to get by was hugely disappointing.”  Earlier, the minister revealed she had complained to her own energy supplier that her household bill is too high. Therese Coffey accused energy firms of using rate-payers “as their cash flow” ahead of a £ annual bill rise in April. The Work and Pensions Secretary, who earns £,, told MPs: “I don’t pretend in any way to be poor, I’m not trying to suggest that at all. “But I did notice very signicantly my utility suppliers all of a sudden increased my standing order, anticipating perhaps rises.  “I’ve had to go back and get them to bring back down my standing order because it’s not in line with my bills.” She told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee people could “ask for that to be reviewed” or even go to Ofgem. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth branded her remarks “tone deaf”. He added: “On top of rocketing heating bills, price going up, wages stagnating and Tory tax rises working people, families and pensioners need real help now like Labour’s £ reduction in energy bills.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jonathan AshworthStephen TimmsDepartment for Work and PensionsOfgemCabinetConservative PartyCitizens Advice BureauEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nadhim Zahawi, who was until recently the Vaccines Minister, urged Brits to get their jabs after he was laid low recently despite having both doses and a booster.The Education Secretary told Sky News’ Kay Burley: I think, without the vaccine and the booster, Iaposd have had it even worse, my doctor said, because itaposs your physiology. Itaposs your bodyaposs reaction to Covid that will determine how severe or asymptomatic you might be.” He added “by day four or five it got into my chest and started really affecting my breathing, as his temperature hit .C. Mr Zahawi said his doctor suggested he might have to be put on steroids “or something heavier”, telling him: If you hadnapost had the vaccine and the booster, I guarantee you you would be in hospital and probably intubated. He urged viewers: Get your vaccine and get your booster... the offer is evergreen from the NHS.This thing is not like a cold. Certainly I would have been in big trouble, according to my doctor.He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out plans for living with Covid on February , andthe data continues in the direction itaposs moving in at the moment restrictions could be lted on February .Mr Zahawi said the Government will be led by the data when it comes to ending the need to self-isolate. But Boris Johnson has already said he intends to end self-isolation laws on February , even for people who test positive. Meanwhile the schools chief revealed he met with the exams regulator to discuss reports of private schools using grading arrangements in  as an excuse to boost their proportion of top A-level grades. A report from the Sunday Times found one school saw its proportion of A*s at A-level jump from % to % in , when teacher-assessed grades were awarded following the cancellation of full public exams. Mr Zahawi told Sky News he had met with the exams regulator Ofqual this week, after a viewer asked why private schools had used the system as an excuse for increasing their numbers of top grades. The minister said: Every allegation is investigated by the exam boards and all the records [of teacher assessment] have been kept... sothere are any new allegations they will investigate them as well. They also reassured me that actually when you look at whether itaposs independent schools or academies, the children who were expected to get high grades, A-grades, actually achieved those. He said every headteacher had to sign really stringent declarations that they had followed grading arrangements properly. Mr Zahawi added that grade inflation is why I want to go back to exams, and while there is no perfect system the best system is exams. He said advance information on topics covered in the  exams released by Ofqual on Monday, and the grading arrangements for this year - with pupils marked between  and  levels - will help mitigate the impact of Covid on pupilsapos results. Asked why private schools have charitable status, Mr Zahawi said he wants to see fee-paying schools do much more to open up to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. He suggested private schools could help run multi-academy trusts. Itaposs also important that they play their part... can we get our independent schools to join us on what the evidence suggests is the best way forward, which is a family of schools that are well-managed, tightly managed, really well-supported in a multi-academy trust thataposs high-performing - we know the evidence suggests that delivers the best outcome for every child. Mr Zahawi also said he will ask the Treasury for more moneypupils do not appear to have caught up on lost learning by the end of the Parliament, and added that he is writing to parents to urge they and their children take up tutoring. He urged a viewer who said their GCSE-age child had received no catch-up tutoring under the Governmentaposs flagship scheme to get in contact with your school. He added: Every school has the opportunity to take up the tutoring programme... the first term of this year we have done as many tutoring hours as the whole of last year. He said reports by the Times Educational Supplement that the programme is only meeting % of its target only looked at one of the three pillars of the tutoring programme, with school-led tutoring the most successful.

The bizarre dispute, branded aposFence-gateapos by locals, went viral around the world last September. But as the row intensied, Stephen, , claimed an outraged man aimed an airgun at Christine before firing.  The couple, who used to run a sweet shop from the property, were so spooked they removed the fence a week later. They are now selling the three-bed semi-detached house for £,. Land Registry records show the house was bought for £, in  - a whopping £, more than the current asking price. Christine, , who works in a nursing home, said relations with her neighbours had gone sour since the fence row. She said: We were going to sell the house beforehand but whataposs gone on has soured it a bit. We were going to sell the house but it brought it all forward.  We took the fence down th September, it was up for a week. We just want to move on with it.I got trolled on Facebook. Some of the comments we saw were awful.Recalling the moment a yob fired an air rle at Christine, she said: To think the guy who shot at me got away with that. I said to my husband aposthat guys got a gunapos The minute he aimed at me, Stephen dragged me inside. Stephen added: Weaposve had people eating their chips on our windowsill and looking through the window while we are trying to relax. Itaposs not on. Most people wouldnapost want people using their land as a footpath and neither do we. We just wanted to protect our property. The couple ran a sweet shop up until , but closed and converted it into a living room. Estate agent Pattinson, who are selling the house, say the property has so many potential options. In the particulars, they say: Perhaps it will become a beautul and substantial family home, maybe with a separate granny annex, or split into two separate dwellings. Maybe the former shop could once again be put back into service, and what could be done with the garage...  The mind boggles. Mr and Mrs Williams are hoping to move  miles away to the idyllic village of Rothbury, where notorious killer Raoul Moat shot himself after being cornered by cops.

In an announcement to parliament, Johnson said that the new plan would see the schedule for axing years of restrictions moved forward dramatically. He said that the ability to do so shows that the hard work of the British people is paying off, however not everyone agrees with the Prime Ministeraposs decision. The new policy sees England break away dramatically from the plans and directions of other nations, many of which continue to use quarantines, fines and restrictions to help combat the virus.Johnson has been warned by some scientists that the move will signal that the pandemic is coming to an end and may well leave vulnerable people dangerously exposed to the virus.Will Covid rules be scrapped completely   Under the upcoming changes all Covid rules, including the need to self-isolate, will be struck off in England. The move comes as the government seeks to enter a new phase of endemicity as the country gears up to aposliving with Covidapos. When will Covid rules be scrapped  Following Johnsonaposs announcement to parliament, the rules are expected to be scrapped in two weeks time, a month earlier than originally planned. This means that self-isolation could be axed as soon as February . The rules had originally been intended for the bin on March , a full month later than the new plans.For the time being, lateral flow tests are expected to continue being provided for free beyond the end of February, however, the timescale for the end of the scheme is expected to emerge towards the end of the month.Will your employer be able to force you to workyou have Covid   People will be advised not to go to workthey pick up the virus, Downing Street has confirmed. However, without the force of the government-backed rules or fines system, the door is open for employers to ask staff to work even when theyaposre unwell. The government has likened future advice for going to work with the virus to that of other infectious diseases. A spokesperson for the PM, when askedpeople would be able to go to work with Covid, said: So there would be guidance, that would not be what we are recommending.  What we would simply be doing is removing the domestic regulations which relate to isolation. But obviously in the same way that someone with flu, we wouldnapost recommend they go to work, we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease.He continued: Weaposve talked about how we will need to manage living with coronavirus as we emerge from this pandemic. We are entering into that phase of endemicity as Iaposve talked about, and itaposs only right that we adjust according.aposWill £ grant for self-isolation be scrapped   At the time of writing it is not clear whether the £ grant that has been available to people on low incomes forced to self-isolate will still be available after the lting of restrictions.However, the Mirror understands that Test and Trace Support Payment is due to come under review next week, ahead of February aposs rule scrapping.The system was introduced in September  in a bid to help workers on low wages manage self-isolation periods financially.

Bash, bash it, ooh, it’s biting.”The teaching assistant, of Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, was found guilty of wildle offences following a joint investigation by RSPCA and Cheshire Police. Her boyfriend, Grant Leigh Jnr, , of the same address, was also found guilty, reports Manchester Evening News.Shocking footage reveals Leigh Jnr showing the toddler how to hit a badger with a spade. In another clip, Carding encouraged the toddler to get a lurcher dog to attack a badger den saying aposaposher face is going to be smashed. Good boy, get him out. Look at them fighting.aposapos  She further baited three dogs into aposapospulling a fox to pieces.aposapos Inquiries revealed Carding had been joined on the family expedition by her boyfriend and his ex-huntsman father, Grant Leigh Snr, , of Tameside. One picture showed Grant Jr holding a dead fox with a child accompanied by the caption family day out, learn these kids young. Hunting mad. Carding, who worked at a primary school in Manchester for six years until , was found guilty of five cruelty charges under the Protection of Badgers Act  at Tameside Magistratesapos Court. Grant Sr was found guilty of two offences under the Animal Welfare Act. Grant Jr changed his plea to guilty at the start of the trial, admitting to seven cruelty offences. The joint investigation began in October  after a police wildle crime officer was tipped off about a private Facebook group called The Real Terrier Men and Lurcher Men.Photos and videos of illegal fox hunting and badger baiting were shown in the group. Grant Sr operated as a group administrator and posted messages including anybody up for a few dogs. He also boasted about taking his son badger baiting as a way of celebrating his recent prison release.Another picture he posted showed his partner with a fox and another of a black and white dog with blood on its face. Officers traced the three suspects and seized seven dogs including two Lurchers and two Patterdale terriers - many of which had telltale injuries consistent with aposaposhunting activities.aposapos Six of the injured hounds were rescued from dirty and squalid kennels at the rear of Grant Sraposs home in Hyde. The seventh was found at Cardingaposs home.  RPSCA prosecutor Hazel Stevens said: “This is a case that is shocking and horrendous and in which children are present. “The fact a two-year-old child was being encouraged to join in can only be described as barbaric. Two mobile phones were seized which revealed a series of video clips showing badger baiting and fox hunting, the prosecutor said. aposaposIn these video clips Grant Jr is pictured showing a child how to hit a live badger over the head with a spade, she continued. Cardingaposs voice is heard and it appears that she is filming and providing commentary. On one video, she was encouraging a child to get a dog to attack a wild animal. aposaposOne video depicts a male digging into a badger sett and then a chamber being revealed with badger material and what appeared to be the head of a badger within. “This is a family affair and as they call it on Facebook, it is a family day out where they went to hunt and kill foxes and badgers. aposaposShe was encouraging a dog to pull a fox to pieces and in another video a two year old child is told to say ‘aposf**k off’, which is amusing to them. She encourages the child to join in and in these videos. “This is an ongoing violent, nasty and vicious treatment of wild animals for their own enjoyment.aposapos An independent vet who attended the scene during the investigation said in his report that the kennels were ‘unhygienic’ and described many of the dogs as having ‘mature scars’. When Leigh Sr was arrested, officers found a kennel block in the back garden containing six dogs - three of which were recognisable from the videos.  The two black Patterdale Terriers had scarring on their faces and one was underweight three bull lurcher types - one called Mission - also had facial injuries and a white and black terrier - called Clover - had fresh wounds and a swollen face and muzzle. RSPCA investigator Kirsty Withnall told the court: “Grant Jr was involved in the buying and selling of dogs but Grant Sr had taken over on behalf of his son. “They had a reasonable turnover of dogs which had been sold and bought. aposaposComments on the Facebook page talked of ‘bangs pigs %’, and ‘lurcher that will do everything and I mean everything.’ There were a lot of links to hunting everything from badgers to deer. aposaposThere are children in the photos and Paris Carding was present during the recordings. She was responsible for taking the footage. There is a Facebook video posted by Grant Senior of a aposfamily day outapos.aposapos Another RSPCA inspector said: aposaposOn the videos Paris says: ‘There it is, it’s a pig isn’t it.’ A pig is a term to mean badger. The terrier will go into the hole and it will locate the badger and pull it out. There are three dogs on that video with the badger. Paris says ‘Good boy, get him out. Look at them fighting’.  The voice was of Paris Carding and there is no potential it could have been of anyone . I knew this from the five second conversation I had with her. I had no idea of her job or what she did.aposapos In a police interview, Carding gave a statement denying it was her in the videos but her voice was recognised by the headmaster at her school. She did not give any evidence in her defence. Grant Sraposs defence lawyer Chris Squibbs said: aposaposHe was previously employed as a huntsman and he maintains his interest in this. “He has been involved in these activities because it was passed down to him by his father and he passed it down to his son.aposapos But District Judge Bernard Begley told Carding: aposaposA lot has been made of the ‘family day out’ and I am satisfied it was you in the clips in question giving active encouragement to those present. You were filming what was occurring as a perverse memento to keep or show. aposaposThis was truly the most abhorrent of family days out and I struggle to believe what you have done. The reality is, you have no answer to the overwhelming evidence of your presence. “You were there for the purpose of filming what was happening which glamorised the carnage you were causing.aposapos The case was adjourned and all three will be sentenced on March . PC Jim Clark from Cheshire Constabulary’s Rural Crime Team said: “This investigation uncovered a horric catalogue of abuses and neglect of animals and cruelty to wildle. This result reinforces our determination to work with our colleagues at the RSPCA to deter this type of behaviour as part of our commitment to protecting our rural communities.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cheshire PoliceCourt caseCrimeBadgersAnimalsFox huntingAnimal cruelty\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Brent Knoll team believe everyone deserves a second chance, and have spent the last year and a half working with behaviourists on Buddyaposs training.The senior dog has come on heaps and bounds and is ready for a patient and special home.to ourTeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Katy Darelli, Deputy Manager at RSPCA Brent Knoll, said: This cute lad is an affectionate chap who sadly had a less than ideal relationship with his previous owner.There was a clear breakdown in communication between them and this resulted in confrontational misunderstandings.Buddy began to retaliate to these experiences at which point ownership was relinquished to us after a request for euthanasia was rejected by his vet.  “Buddy is going to need a very special home with conscientious owners who have time and patience to help him live the happiest le possible.This le will need to be free from confrontation, other dogs and other identied stressors. “Like so many animals who come into our care, it can take months of care, time and love to get them to a stage where they are ready for a new home but we donapost give up on these animals, everyone deserves a second chance.”Since his arrival at the centre, Buddy has worked hard with behaviourists to try to tackle his issues and identy triggers. The team have encouraged pleasant play routines by swapping and positive reinforcement training, which has helped avoid old patterns of behaviour repeating. They discovered that Buddy loves toys, in particular squeaky balls, and enjoys eating from activity feeders which provide him with extra daily stimulation.

He said once the speed goes beyond around  mph, the doors will automatically lock and prevents any danger. Rear-view mirror Another tip involves the rear-view mirrors.

Michael Crane, , and his fiance Linda Brown, , were among dozens of couples left in the lurch when Best Western Park Hall Hotel in Lancashire unexpectedly shut on Monday.According to the Lancashire Post, some couples turned up at the hotel to confront management and demanded refunds after learning of the closure, prompting staff to call the police.Michael, who paid £ to have the date and time of his wedding tattooed on his left hand before Christmas, said he was shocked and angry when he found out. He said: “Never in a million years did we think they would shut down,” he said. Itaposs a beautul room, they have an old mediaeval hall and when itaposs done up it looks smashing. The room sealed it for us.  But since we booked it, the hotel has shut down twice. Itaposs been a nightmare since the beginning. They blamed the lockdown but the government guidelines didnapost say they had to shut at the time. You donapost expect that from a hotel attached to a name like Best Western. The couple, who have been together four years, forked out £, upfront for the wedding, which was due to be held on August . Michael, from Warrington, Cheshire, said he has family coming from America who had booked to stay at the hotel too. He now fears they wonapost get any of that back. To make matters worse, he had the time and date of their wedding inked on his left hand before Christmas, having been so excited about the occasion.  Iaposve got a lot of tattoos, but since getting my Covid jab they donapost heal very well so I wanted it to heal in time for the wedding, he explained. The couple has been able to rearrange their wedding for the next day at a dferent location, so he will get the  on his tattoo adjusted to , but the time will be wrong.Michael, who booked the venue in October, said the couple had found out about the closure on the weekend, after spotting a Google review from someone who mentioned the news.“We werenapost even told,” he said. Frantic couples confronted staff at the hotel on Sunday when news spread on social media of the imminent closure. Adam Weate, , and Danielle Sugden, , had also been due to tie the knot at Park Hall on May . The groom-to-be dashed to Park Hall on Sunday night to be told thathe ed at am the next day there would be someone on hand to offer explanations and a refund. But when they arrived at the allotted hour they say they were faced with a scene of chaos and they werenapost able to speak to anyone in authority. They were given just £,, despite having paid £,, Adam claimed. Former Wigan Athletic chairman Bill Kenyon, who owns nearby Holland Hall, has offered both couples the use of his venue for the same price they paid Park Hall. Adam said it had been a “rollercoaster”, with the wedding having already been cancelled twice. “It was due to Covid, there was nothing they could do about that, but they didnapost handle it with any sort of empathy,” he said. Then on Sunday night, we saw on social media that the place was going to close. I dashed there late at night and they told me to come back  hours later and all would be sorted - but it wasnapost. We got £, of the promised refund but no explanations, including the rest of the money and all the guests who were booked in. Mr Kenyon said: There canapost be many things worse than seeing lots of finely-tuned wedding plans going wrong. We hope we can at least help some of the couples affected. Jenni Halliday, Sercoaposs contract director for asylum accommodation services, said: With the signicant increases in the number of people arriving in the UK we have been faced with no alternative but to temporarily accommodate some asylum seekers in hotels. These hotels are only used as a last resort but as a provider of accommodation services on behalf of the Home Office we have a responsibility to find accommodation for the asylum seekers that are being placed in our care.

She refused and said she was getting a lt from her flat mate. He added: At :am, one of the senior boys phoned me. The boy who phoned seemed alarmed and said that Miss Tweedie was in the hotel.

Heres everything you need to know about the BA. iantEverything you need to know about the new stealth Omicron mutant BA. Covid iant Image: Getty ImagesBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Feb |commentsDespite Boris Johnsonaposs proposed plans to axe all Covid restrictions and self-isolation rules in the coming months, there are still over , Covid cases being reported in the UK per day. While the new stealth Omicron iant is still being studied by experts, it is already believed to be more infectious and transmissible than its predecessor. And now, dizziness and fatigue are beginning to emerge as potential symptoms of the new sub-strain of Omicron, along with the original Covid symptoms. These include a high temperature, a new or continuous cough or a loss of the ability to taste or smell. The new Omicron aposstealth iantapos is believed to have been identied at least  times in the UK since November. Trevor Bedford, a computational virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre in the US, tweeted that the BA. Omicron strain represents roughly % in the UK.  Hereaposs everything you need to know about the stealth Omicron sub-strain iant, including what the UK Health Security Agencyhas said it is and what the symptoms may be. What is the BA. new Covid iant in the UK and is it more dangerous than Omicron  The BA. Covid strain is thought to be an Omicronsub-strain with a higher growth rate, which can potentially be more easily transmissible, according to the UKHSA. The new strain of Covid is currently also being referred to as the aposStealth Variantapos and has been identied in India, parts of Europe, South Africa, the US and the UK.  Despite it being dubbed a aposstealthapos iant thataposs supposedly not identiable on tests, this claim is  as it can be detected by lateral flowand PCR tests. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for UKHSA, explained: We now know that BA. has an increased growth rate which can be seen in all regions in England. We have also learnt that BA. has a slightly higher secondary attack rate than BA. in households. Although hospitalisations and deaths remain low, cases are still high in some areas and some age groups so it’s important that we continue to act cautiously as restrictions are lted.  While the majority of cases of the virus are believed to be in Denmark, experts in the country donapost see it as cause for concern. Anders Fomsgaard, chief physician and virus researcher at the Statens Serum Institut , told Danish media: We cannot see any dference in hospitalisation numbers, death rates with BA., so it is not something that worries us yet.” Adding: Right now we should just treat it as yet another iant until new data should eventually show other results.  Despite this highly transmissible iant stemming from Omicron, the World Health Organisation is yet to identy Omicron as a iant of concern. More information will be gathered over time, as researchers study the new strain. However, experts have advised for eligible people across the UK to get all three Covid vaccinations to increase protection against the virus. How long does Covid vaccine and booster jab immunity last for With the UK rapidly ramping up booster jab vaccinations as Omicron became a dominant Covid iant, many vaccinated Brits were able to avoid more severe coronavirus side effects. However, with cases still being reported and the new BA. strain emerging, many are concerned about how protected theyaposll be against the mutation. The UKHSA has stated that three doses of the vaccine are % effective at preventing symptomatic infections by the new Omicron BA. sub-strain, while the same number of doses are % effective against the original Omicron BA. strain.  However, experts have not officially stated how many days, weeks or months you are immune against Covid for per dose. What are the confirmed Omicron symtpoms  With BA. being a sub-strain of the original BA. Omicron iant, the symptoms are likely to be similar.While new Omicron symptoms may be identied over time, none have been outlined yet. In the meantime, you should continue to look out for the following Covid symptoms, according to the ZOE Covid Study and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention :Congested or runny nose HeadacheFatigueNew or continuous coughShortness of breath or dficulty breathing Muscle or body aches New loss of taste or smell Sore throatNausea or vomitingDiarrheaIf you do find you have one or more of these symptoms, you should take a Covid test immediately and self-isolate to avoid spreading the virus to others around you.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iantCoronavirus vaccineMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old noticed the blotch on the right side of her forehead years ago, but thought it was a birthmark so didnapost think much of it. She started noticing the mark because it stayed white while the rest of her face became red while exercising, in training as a -time British skipping champion.It became more prominent during her pregnancy, prompting Rachael to get it checked and discover she had basal cell carcinoma - the most common type of skin cancer.She then faced a terrying nine-month wait until after she had given birth to have surgery - allowing the cancer to spread and meaning a larger area of skin had to be removed.  The fitness business owner has now shared shocking photos of the hole in her forehead and the large scar sheaposs been left with after surgery. Rachael wants to warn people about the risk of skin cancer even for those who arenapost sun-worshippers. The woman from Redditch in Worcestershire said: I first noticed it a few years ago but stupidly I didnapost get it checked out until recently. I thought it was a birthmark to start off with so I didnapost really think anything of it, just because Iaposd had it for so long and it never grew from what I saw anyway. But when I fell pregnant last year I really started really noticing a dference - it started looking more prominent even when I wasnapost exercising and it looked bigger around the edges so it was growing. I had this test where they basically take a section of it out like a hole punch and test it and the results came back that it was low-grade skin cancer.I knew it could just keep spreading and growing and I just wanted to get it out but being pregnant I didnapost want to cause any issues with that. After finding out what it was and having to wait to get it removed it was playing on my mind quite a bit. While I had to wait to have the surgery I was worried about it spreading - Iaposd already had it for a few years and I just kept thinking how much bigger is it going to get in that time. I knew the bigger the area was the bigger the scar would be and it was already quite a big area. If Iaposd left it any longer it could have gone into my eyebrow or hairline which isnapost nice to think.But it was definitely worth it to have my baby here and healthy and both of us are okay now. The mum says she first noticed the mark on her face in  but brushed it off for years until it started to look more prominent during her pregnancy last year. At the beginning of , a suspicious mole on her mumaposs back was diagnosed as low-grade skin cancer, which also encouraged Rachael to get her mark checked out.  After visiting her local GP in February  she was referred to a dermatologist at Kidderminster Hospital in May that year, where a test confirmed she had basal cell carcinoma.With the NHS waiting time for an operation being up to two years, Rachael decided to go private for Mohs surgery - where a specialist cuts away the affected area and further another layer of skin to make sure they get all of the cancerous cells.So just four months after the mum and her husband Adam Rollisson, , welcomed their baby James, she had surgery at Solihull Hospital, on January th. Rachael said: I was fully awake for the surgery and that was the scariest thing. They injected the area with a local anaesthetic so I had quite a few injections in my head to numb it and that was probably the most painful part of it. They cut the skin away and take it away for a few hours to test it and make sure theyaposve got all of it. They got it all in one go the first time so I was quite lucky and then I went back in for an hour and a half to have it sewn back up. That was probably the worst bit because it was a lot of pulling and tugging of the skin, which wasnapost nice at all. The feeling of the skin being pulled over is going to haunt me. They allowed me to take a picture of the hole left by the section they took out before they sewed it back up again so that was quite scary seeing that. I didnapost think it would be that big of a surgery so when I came out of the surgery I was quite upset because the scar was so big but Iaposm just relieved Iaposm in the clear now. The mum says her skin cancer diagnosis came as a shock as she has always been careful with sun cream and doesnapost sit in the rays much. After her scary experience, she warns that aposit can happen to anyoneapos and hopes to encourage people to get their skin checked. Rachael said: Iaposm not really a sun-worshipper but I do tan really easily. I wasnapost in the sun often at all, not enough to expect to have something like this anyway. Itaposs scary because it shows that it really can happen to anyone, evenyouaposre not a sun-worshipper. Iaposve always been quite careful with sun cream but Iaposll definitely be even more careful now, especially with the baby. I would just advise people to get anything dferent on their skin checked out definitely.

The most pleasurable part was getting up the beach before anyone . We saw deer, rabbits and foxes on the beach. The feeling is is a real privilege. It is so special.He also said that seeing porpoises and seals were a common occurrence. We saw the sand dunes develop, he said. We saw a whole ecosystem reclaiming the land from the sea.

The hypnobirthing teacher has now shared shocking photos of her rash-ravaged stomach and blistered limbs in a bid to raise awareness of the rare condition, which only affects one in , women. Fiona, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: I got a few tiny, really itchy marks around my belly button that felt like nettle stings. I went to the doctors after a few days because it was getting more and more itchy and unbearable. They gave me some steroid creams which didnapost really touch it and it was getting bigger - my belly was covered in red, itchy plaques. It was the third GP I went to see that said it looked like the condition Pemphigoid Gestationis and he referred me to a dermatologist who gave me the strongest steroid cream you can get. It was like I was allergic to my own baby. By  weeks I took myself to AE because I couldnapost bear it and nothing was touching it and they gave me four days of oral steroids which really helped it calm down. But two days before I was due to give birth it started to get unbearable again and  hours after Iaposd given birth it just exploded and turned into blisters. If I scratched it, it felt good and temporarily took the itch away but obviously I was removing the blisters and skin so then I was left with raw, really painful skin and the blisters just came back on top of that. It hurt a lot to even hold my son so I wasnapost really able to enjoy the newborn stage because of it. Fiona was initially prescribed a steroid cream by her GP and referred to a dermatologist. But she ed to the dermatologist multiple times with aposunbearableapos itchiness and pain and was prescribed stronger steroid creams and some oral steroids.  After giving birth to her son Barney, now seven months, on June th, her skin aposexplodedapos into blisters that covered her stomach, thighs, arms and chest. A blood test to check Fionaaposs antibody levels confirmed doctorsapos suspicions and she was diagnosed with Pemphigoid Gestationis on June th. The dermatologist at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital then started her on a strong dose of oral steroids in a desperate bid to get the excruciating condition under control. The mum then spent the next six months slowly working her way down the dferent strengths of oral steroids until she could be weaned off them, just before Christmas. She says the itchy plaques, blisters and scarring from the extreme reaction have finally subsided, although she still occasionally has to use steroid creams and may suffer minor flare-ups for the rest of her le. Knowing sufferers of the condition are likely to develop it again in further pregnancies, the hypnobirthing teacher and her husband Warren Hooker, , have decided to not have any more children. Fiona said: Because Iaposm quite recently off the steroids, every now and again I get a bit itchy and have to use a bit of steroid cream, so I think my body is still getting over it. A lot of people have to have immunosuppressive therapies to get off the steroids and get the condition under control so Iaposm quite lucky. Once itaposs triggered itaposs made worse by certain hormones - oestrogen mainly - so each menstrual cycle I may get a little flare but not enough to need any steroids. So I may have some symptoms of it forever but not as bad as before. Itaposs put me off being pregnant again especially because the research says it will come on earlier and worse and I donapost think I could do that again even with steroids.

In England,  in  have Covid - with  in  in Wales and  in  in Scotland having the virus. Last week, their stats showed that in England  in  have Covid, with  in  in Wales and  in  in Scotland.Is Boris Johnson being hasty  Have your say in the comment section New daily symptomatic cases continue to rise in all regions, they confirmed. But cases are now slowing in most age groups, with the exception of the - range. The older, more vulnerable + age group, are also slightly increasing. According to the study, reinfection rates of confirmed cases are estimated to currently be around % - based on an average of the last two weeks.It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he plans to remove all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England a month early. Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid Study, said: ”Although the true rate of new cases, unlike the government dashboard, is currently far too high. It is somewhat reassuring to see signs of rates slowing down and it looks like we’ve now passed the second big peak of the year, with hospitalisations, ICU cases and deaths also continuing to fall.Cases need to decline more among older and more vulnerable age groups before we can start to relax, and it’s still too early to tell the effects of Long Covid as a result of an Omicron infection or the effect of the super infectious BA. iant that continues to increase nationally.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Despite the government’s hasty decision to end all restrictions this month, and the message this sends, this does not mean the pandemic is over and we should all try to be good citizens by continuing to self-isolate when ill and protect ourselves and others from what can be a really nasty infection.” The current Covid regulations were due to expire on March  but Mr Johnson is considering making changes weeks before. Providing the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we will be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a full month early, he today told MPs. It is my intention toon the first day after the half-term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid.

The call kicked off with Harry and Gareth greeting each other with the phrase “Hello bud. How you doing ”, with the prince later joking that the former sportsman was “way older” than him.  Gareth chuckled and responded by flexing one of his tattooed biceps and telling Harry: “I’ve got bigger guns than you, bud,” prompting Harry to laugh and mimic him by saying, “Oh, bigger guns”. Asked what made him so passionate about advocating for HIV, Harry said: “Once you get to meet people and you see the suffering around the world, I certainly can’t turn my back on that. “Then add in the fact that my mum’s work was unfinished, I feel obligated to try and continue that as much as possible.

I just want to help fix things.” Diana, who died following a car crash in , changed the global perception of HIV and Aids, raising awareness of the condition and supporting hospices. In the late s, when many still believed the disease could be contracted through casual contact, she sat by the sickbed of a man with Aids and held his hand. Harry described how the virus used to be a death sentence, but was now a “manageable disease”. He praised his mother’s empathy and curiosity, and said: “What my mum did and so many other people did at that time was to smash that wall down, and kick the door open and say, ‘No, when people are suffering, then we need to learn more’.  “I’ve seen a huge change. People are able and happy to talk about HIV so much more openly, but the stigma still exists and therefore the testing is still a problem.” Former Wales full-back Gareth, who revealed he was HIV positive in , said: “It wouldn’t be scaryyou understood what living with HIV in  is.”Sharing his daily medical routine with Harry, he said: “At am, every single day, my alarm goes off. “I take my HIV medication which is one tablet, and I feel that my day then begins.” Gareth, who came out as the first openly gay rugby union player in , said it was a daunting experience to walk into a sexual health clinic, but he said it was so much easier to test now, in the privacy of your own home, or at drop-in clinics where there are people to talk to. He added: “The sooner you find outyou’re positive then the sooner you can start treatment. If you leave it too late, then it can have circumstances that are irreplaceable, irreparable.”Tackle HIV, a campaign led by Gareth Thomas in partnership with ViiV Healthcare and the Terrence Higgins Trust, aims to tackle stigma and misunderstanding around HIV.

He has since been fighting to remain on the teaching register, arguing he is still fit to be in the classroom.  Today it was revealed that the mother of the pupil has ridden to his rescue, arguing that he should be able to keep teaching and that he was in a stable relationship with her child. In a testimonial to The General Teaching Council for Scotlandaposs  she wrote: He has shown credibility in his role and professionalism at all times. His encouragement allowed pupils to believe in themselves. She added: She has no concerns about Mr Spittalaposs teacher pupil relationship with Person A and sees them in a stable relationship and has been integrated into their family le. Despite the mumaposs intervention, and following a four day hearing, the teaching regulator decided Spittal will be struck off from the register. Panel chair Alison Reid said: In relation to stage  fitness to teach the aposs findings are that the teacher has fallen signicantly short of the standards that are expected of a registered teacher and is therefore unfit to teach. Section .b of the public services reform order means that the  has to direct that the teacher be removed from the register. The  heard how Spittal first kissed the teen when she stayed behind to help him tidy up iPads in his classroom in April . Emails showed that Spittal sent an email to Pupil A at .pm on an evening in May  askingshe was having chill, fun times. He then asked her to: Talk me through ityou are.  He was outed to the school by his then-girlfriend, Kim Smyth, who found emails, including nude images, between the pair on their shared computer. On Monday, Spittal confirmed he was still in a relationship with the former pupil but admitted that his behaviour back in  was totally inappropriate. He said he was ashamed of his actions but believes he still has a lot to offer to teaching. Spittal, now a delivery courier, said: I think about it everyday while Iaposm sitting in my van about where I could beI hadnapost made stupid mistakes. I made decisions and choices I made in a five to six week period I am ashamed and embarrassed of. I use a traffic light system. Stop, thought and action. I stop and process what is going on around me, I then think and assess my options before proceeding with my choice. My professionalism was called into place, it wonapost happen again, I admit all of the allegations.  Prior to the decision, Presenting Officer Sarah Donnachie argued: Mr Spitall did not act honestly at Inveralmond, he knew what he was doing was wrong and he tried to cover up his actions. Mr Spittal has shown no efficient insight into his actions. He has not fully engaged with his feelings and not been honest with himself in the events that led to the kiss. She continued: Mr. Spittal knew what he was doing was wrong. He only disclosed this to Inveralmond when his ex-partner discovered the relationship. He had been reminded of professional respect on two occasions prior to the kiss. Legal Council for Spitall, Claire Rafferty, said her client had taken steps to ensure this doesnapost happen again. She said: He has been under total remediation for two and half years, showing a passion and commitment to teaching. Iaposm not sure what  a person could do to remediate. I am confident he would make the right decision when faced with dficult circumstances. He has put measures in place to ensuresimilar circumstances would arise he would not repeat his actions. His personality traits make it unlikely there will be a repetition of conduct. Elizabeth Gibb, a chartered occupational psychologist who has been working with Spittal since June , gave evidence in the teacheraposs favour at the hearing. She said: I think he took responsibility for his actions before I met him. He scored lower than most adults on assertiveness. He is fundamentally agreeable and is fundamentally trustworthy and unlikely to use charm. He has now given great consideration to how he acted and he seeked help. He is highly unlikely to bend the rules in the future. Today the  concluded their investigation by issuing Spittal with a removal order.

Mrs Justice Arbuthnot is due to study Williamaposs case at a trial in the Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered. The trial is scheduled to take place in Liverpool later this month. The judge considered preliminary hearings at an online hearing on Tuesday.  Lawyers told her that bosses at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, who have responsibilities for Williamaposs care, wanted decisions to be made as to whether he should have a kidney transplant and whether le-extending haemodialysis should be continued. The Judge is also expected to consider whether active treatment should be withdrawn. Justice Arbuthnot heard that the withdrawal of treatment would lead to Williamaposs death. Williamaposs mother does not want treatment to end and claims that he doesnapost either. A barrister representing Ms McLennan, Victoria Butler-Cole QC, told Mrs Justice Arbuthnot the teenager had very bad kidney disease and had few treatment options left.He was in a pretty dire situation, she added. With the legal case ongoing the family is now also appealing for potential le-saving donors to come forward and help William, said a spokesman for law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represents Ms McLennan, on Wednesday. If a living donor can be found, William would have the best chance of a kidney transplant being successful. Ms McLennan said tests had shown that relatives were not suitable donors. If any of us could give William one of our kidneys we wouldnapost hesitate for a second to do so, she said.  Itaposs a race against time but finding someone kind enough to donate a kidney would mean the world to us. We know itaposs an incredibly selfless act for someone to agree to and there would be assessments to ensure suitability. Justice Arbuthnot has ruled that William, who lives in Lancaster, could be named in media reports of the case after being told that his mother, Ami McLennan, wanted to make a public appeal for a kidney donor. Williamaposs mother wanted reporters to be allowed to name him in reports of the litigation - a campaign that was supported by a number of journalists. They said Williamaposs plight had been reported before Court of Protection proceedings began - and argued that it would be dficult to report hearings without creating an information jigsaw which would give away his identity. Judges typically rule that patients at the centre of Court of Protection proceedings should not be named in media reports, in line with their human right to respect for privacy and family le. A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, said: “We recognise that this is a very dficult time for William and his family and we will continue to support them. Our clinicians have worked very hard to enable William’s treatment to take place so far, and he continues to have his haemodialysis, as agreed with his family, subject to any change in his clinical condition. The decision on whether a transplant would be in his best interest is a very complex one, requiring consideration of a range of very dficult issues including signicant risks and the possibility that his transplant would fail, which is why the Court of Protection is being asked to make a decision on the best care for William going forward.”Late last year The Mirror reported on William, an avid golf fan, receiving a lesson from professional golfer Trevor Newsham at Heysham Golf Club in Morecambe.Trevor, , was impressed with his swing saying: “He seemed really bright, taking it on board and hit great shots.

Residents on the road in Telford, Shropshire, want the prince’s name removed from their street signs, as he faces a civil case in the US accused of sexually assaulting Virginia Gufre when she was just . This is a claim he has continued to vehemently deny. Virginia Giuffre has said she was trafficked by disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs friend and a convicted sex offender, to have sex with the royal when she was a minor under US law. Ms Giuffre, now , claims she was forced to have sex with the Queen’s son three times between  and , in New York, London, and on Epstein’s private Carribean island.  She has now filed a battery and infliction of emotional distress lawsuit against the prince, who continues to deny all allegations made against him.

The local, who wished to remain anonymous, said it’s “not right that it’s named after him”. Weaposve been thinking about writing to them, they said. Another local doubled down on the suggestion a change was in order, but suggested the replacement name should keep the royal theme.

The Prime Minister said on Tuesday that he wants to drop the legal requirement to isolate by the end of February provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue. Experts have voiced concerns that the removal of the remaining restrictions, which also include the ability for councils to close sites where the virus could be spreading, has caused unease for some of those most at risk.It comes as Mr Johnson continues to fight on despite calls from members of his own party for him to resign over alleged Covid lockdown parties. The Partygate scandal has ripped huge holes in Downing Streetaposs ability to claim it stuck to its own rules during the lockdowns, which saw millions come together to save lives and protect the NHS. Phillip Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said ending the restrictions will heap yet more worry and confusion on thousands of immunocompromised people. He added: In the face of callous silence from a government that should be focused on protecting them, they could feel forced to further isolate themselves from others, putting their wider health, wellbeing and livelihoods in danger. James Taylor from disability equality charity Scope, said: Scrapping self-isolation will mean that some disabled people will be feeling very anxious and could potentially be placed in situations that could prove deadly. Nobody should be forced to gamble with their lives, and we need the government to explain to disabled people how theyaposll be safe when this decision is introduced. Virologist Dr Stephen Grfin, of the University of Leeds, said the plan is crazy which goes against all the fundamental principles of public health. He told Sky News: It seems that the government has completely abandoned any concern about people becoming infected. Downing Streetaposs plan is expected to set out further information for vulnerable groups but officials also believe cutting edge treatments will also mitigate some of the risks.  Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said while there were grounds for optimism in the overall data on deaths and hospital admissions, he had concerns about the vulnerable and people who may not have responded as well to the vaccines. There needs to be robust procedures in place to ensure infections in this group are diagnosed early and antivirals are provided within hours of any positive result, he said. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading said nobody can be certain of the full consequences. If the requirement on infected iniduals to isolate at home is lted as indicated, it will be an experiment which will either be shown to be very brave or very stupid, but nobody knows for sure what the result will be, he said.  Professor Peter Openshaw, who advises the government on Covid through the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said he would be very reluctant to suggest this was the end of Covid, adding it was still a very nasty virus.He told BBC Radio aposs The World At One: We donapost know whataposs around the corner, there could be another iant, perhaps based on Delta or something  with higher pathogenicity, which could come back to bite us anytime, and Iaposm pretty sure that next winter weaposre going to see it back.The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease.  Covid infection levels have risen in three of the four UK nations with only Wales showing a fall, according to figures published on Wednesday.Scotland and Northern Ireland both saw an increase last week in the number of people in private households likely to have coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics .England also saw a rise, though the trend here is uncertain, the ONS said.

Then it mentioned the British council, and I thought: aposItaposs genuine, this!apos It read, aposPlease come back to Spain again, but be careful!apos He added: They donapost fit anymore, but theyaposre still in perfect condition. Paul, from Stalybridge, Manchester, said heaposd lost the teeth after spending the whole day drinking with pals on a holiday in Benidorm, in September . He said: Me and a few friends went to Benidorm for a -day holiday, which coincided with my friendaposs th birthday.  We got halfway through a full dayaposs drinking session. It was getting quite late on, about  or  oaposclock, and I was bloated up with lager, so I had a pint of cider. My friends were all drinking lager, so they drank quicker, and when they finished, they said: aposCome on, weaposre going.apos I had half a pint of cider left, so I threw it down in one, but then I thought aposOh, itaposs coming back, this.apos Paul said he knew that downing the high-strength cider was a crucial mistake a few moments later. He continued: As soon as I got out of the pub, there was one of those great big bottle bins, so I just projectile-d it all into the bin. I thought nothing of it, and then went to the next bar. Paul said he only noticed his teeth were missing when a friend pointed it out to him. He said: My friend said: Where are your teeth apos So I thought aposWhat apos  I realised theyaposd gone in the bin. So I went back to the bin looking for them, but I couldnapost see them anywhere. So I wrote them off. I rang my mates in Manchester, and said: aposI need some new teeth when I come back.apos He added: I spent the rest of the holiday with no teeth, singing Elvis with no teeth, eating and drinking with no teeth. Quite hilarious, really. Paul said when he came back to the UK, he got a new set of  teeth and assumed that the old pair were lost forever. But when Spanish authorities came across the gnashers years later in a landfill site, theyaposd identied them as a body part, and under the law, they had tothem to their owner. Paul had been identied through a DNA swab that heaposd given to police fteen years ago. At the time, he said he was called in by the police for an investigation, but was released without charge and later agreed to give a voluntary DNA sample. Mr Bishop says he does not have a criminal record. Spanish authorities and the British council used that biological information to get the teeth to his doorstep yesterday. He said: I opened the letter, and it turned out my teeth went to some landfill, and because itaposs classed as body parts, the Spanish government wonapost allow them to be destroyed. They were put in some storage centre, and a lab technician came across them a couple of months ago, and tried to trace who the owner of the teeth was through DNA. This professor working for this national biometric company in Spain sent me a letter with it and the teeth in a little plastic bag yesterday. He added: I couldnapost believe it -  years ago!

Rhys Langford, , had osteosarcoma, a cancer which starts in the bones. Over time, the cancer spread to several other areas of his body. When Rhys read the story of Jacob Jones, a boy from the same town who was fighting a rare cancer called neuroblastoma, he immediately donated £, - his le savings - to the six-year-old and his family. The labourer, who worked for a water supplier, also set up an online crowd funder which has since gone viral and raised more than £, for Jacob and his family. Rhys, whose cancer left him bedridden, passed away this morning. Jacobaposs nan Dawn Jones, , paid tribute, saying the family was “deeply upset”. The love, compassion, strength and courage Rhys showed was unbelievable and he will never be forgotten,” she said.Because of his kindness, Jacob will have a better chance of battling with whatever he is faced with now or in the future. We will never be able to show how much Rhys and his family mean to us. We’re overwhelmed by the fundraising by Rhys and we are heartbroken. Our thoughts are with his family. Rhys was a talented athlete before his illness, and at  had become one of the youngest people in the UK to achieve a black belt in the martial art, Krav Maga, at adult grading. He also scaled Snowdon three times and had dreamed of one day going up Ben Nevis. The first sign of a health problem came when Rhys had a sprint race with friends, lost his balance and fell.  Catherine and his dad Paul Langford, , thought he had a groin strain, but Rhys was still limping eight weeks later. He carried on working but reached a point where he was struggling to get out of the lorry. In October , after ious tests, Rhys was tragically diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Experts at Birminghamaposs Royal Orthopaedic Hospital found an cm tumour in his right hip. Rhys had a series of blood transfusions and went through intensive chemotherapy, quickly dropping from st to st lbs. After the  weeks of chemo Rhys stayed in the Royal Orthopaedic for three weeks for an operation to remove all the bone from his kneecap to his right hip.This would mean Rhys would always need two sticks to walk, but the family hoped it would save his le. Up until August , Rhys then underwent another  weeks of chemo, which they initially thought had cured his cancer and he started to get his le back. But in October, a year after his diagnosis, Rhysapos right leg started to swell, growing three times its normal size.  Rhys spent almost a month in ious hospitals being treated for sepsis in the run-up to Christmas until tragically experts found a cancerous mass in his thigh.Although consultants in Birmingham discussed the possibility of a full amputation of the leg, they told the family on January  that Rhys could not be saved.You can donate to Rhysaposs fundraiser for Jacobaposs by visiting the fundraising page,here .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Instead, the awarding of marks was left down to their teachers. And, surprise surprise, children in fee-paying schools scored highest.Research by The Sunday Times showed % of pupils received A*s in , but this soared to almost % in  when teachers gave the grades. In one school alone, North London Collegiate, which charges over £, a year, .% of pupils were awarded A*s, a staggering increase from just .% in . Of course parents who pay for their children’s education want bang for their buck and boy did they get it.  But it’s not just about questionable grade inflation. When the country went into ­lockdown, forcing schools to close, private school pupils switched ­seamlessly to online classes. Children continued to have access to high-quality education and virtual “face to face” lessons with teachers. It should have been the same for all children, but it wasn’t. For many state school kids there often were no lessons with teachers for months. Lesson plans were put online for pupils to ­effectively teach themselves. While in the private sector kids could log in from any number of devices, other ­children, especially those in more deprived parts of the country, were scrabbling for laptops and tablets, ­struggling with wi issues and parents who didn’t have enough data.My fear is this will exacerbate inequality. Education is meant to be the great leveller, but the playing field has never been so unequal.Students with these mega-high grades will get their pick of universities and jobs. There have already been calls for an inquiry. That’s all well and good but what will it solve  Some people have suggested private schools should lose their tax-free status and that money be given to the state school sector. There has to be a way of ensuring the Covid Class of  isn’t penalised any more. I’d like to see a section added to uni and job applications that reveals the level of support, or lack of it, they had in the pandemic, for more context. Because for pupils in state schools, passing under those circumstances should be applauded – and worth far more. It’s time to stop the gap widening any further.

The teenagers were traveling alone, with Shamima wearing a leopard print scarf, -year- old Amira in a luminous yellow hoody and -year-old Kadiza with a grey checked scarf and jumper. The scarves were seen again in CCTV of the girls at a bus terminal in Istanbul turkey, as they carried their heavy bags through the snow and waited for to board the public transport onward. The police appeal was already too late, the girls had already made it across the border. In the weeks leading up to their disappearance, another girl from their school had made the same journey to Syria to join what they Shamima says she was told was just an Islamic community.  Police had been to their school and had wanted to interview the girls about what they knew, but crucially letters asking their parents permission to speak to them never reached home. Instead of the letters being posted or emailed home, they were given to the girls who simply hid them between pages of a text book in their bags. Now in Syria, the teenagers all married Islamic fighters although the roles they played in the caliphate remain uncertain. Shamima claims she was simply a housewe, while intelligence sources have said she was involved with stitching explosives into suicide vests.Kadiza Sultana was the oldest of the three girls. She had married an American ISIS fighter but in phone calls to her sister in the UK, filmed for ITV News, she said she wanted toto the UK but was scared. Speaking straight after the phone call her sister Halima said: “She sounds very terried. She did get very emotional there as well. It feels…I feel really helpless. What can I do  It’s really hard. I don’t think she’s ever made a choice by herself. That was the first one and a very big one. I just look forward to the next call and that’s what keeps me going.” Kadiza is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike a few weeks later in May , but that has never been independently confirmed. Her familyaposs lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, told BBC Newsnight they heard a report of her death in Raqqa.He said: The problem with that was the risk factors around leaving are quite terminal also, in thatISIS were able to detect and capture you then their punishment is quite brutal for trying to leave. In the week where she was thinking of these issues a young Austrian girl had been caught trying to leave ISIS territory and was by all reports beaten to death publicly, so given that that was circulated in the region as well as outside - I think Kadiza took that as a bad omen and decided not to take the risk.  Mr Akunjee added: I think she found out pretty quickly that the propaganda doesnapost match up with the reality. Speaking years later Shamima Begum spoke about losing her friend. She said: Her house was bombed. Underground, there was secret stuff going on and a spy had figured out that something was going on and other people got killed as well. At first I was in denial. I thoughtwe died weaposd die together.  Amira Abase had also married an ISIS fighter, Abdullah Elmir an -year-old Australian, who was nicknamed the Ginger Jihadi, because of his ginger hair. He was killed in a drone strike in December . Amira had been communicating with her mum Fetia Hussen back in the UK via social media but the messages suddenly stopped and her mum now believes her daughter is dead too. Although Shamima Begum has claimed Amira is still alive. Shamima herself has since been stripped of her British citizenship in  and become a mother to three children, who have all died during her time out of the UK. She is now selling food parcels she has been given in a detention camp by aid agencies to make enough money for western clothes and hair dye.  She has claimed she wants to stand out from the other women at a detention camp who are still supporting the terrorist organisation, by changing her look.Ms Begum, who has been living in Al-Roj Camp in northeast since her UK citizenship was stripped in , has spoken to ITV News as part of a new podcast series, presented by Global Security Editor Rohit Kachroo.Shamima Begum: The Blame Game podcast looks at whether the authorities made errors that enabled the -year-old to travel to Syria with her friends. She has made messages which have been smuggled out of the camp and sent to a filmmaker. In them she makes clear her despair at being left aposstatelessapos and describes how she has tried to recover from the trauma of losing three babies. She said: “I’ve moved on from that part of my le, it doesn’t make me feel sad anymore. She remains inside the camp.

But to be on the safe side, here’s everything you need to know about lassa fever, how it spreads and how dangerous it is. What is Lassa fever and how does it spread   Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. The virus is spread from exposure to food or household items contaminated with the urine or faeces of infected rats. You can also catch it through contact with infected bodily fluids. Dr Sir Michael Jacobs, consultant in infectious diseases at the Royal Free London, said: People living in endemic areas of west Africa with high populations of rodents are most at risk of Lassa fever. Imported cases rarely occur where in the world. He added thatit does spread beyond the endemic areas itaposs usually among high-risk occupations like medical or aid workers. What are the symptoms of Lassa fever  Around % of people infected with Lassa fever show no symptoms. However, some people experience symptoms like fever with aches and pains that can progress to headaches, vomiting and diarrhoea. In certain severe cases, people may have facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure.Deafness also occurs in % of patients who survive the disease, but hearing usually s partially after one to three months in half of these cases.

The disease was found in Britain back in  and there have only been eight previous cases in the country. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, has assured that overall risk to UK public due to Lassa fever is very low. She said: Cases of Lassa fever are rare in the UK and it does not spread easily between people. We are contacting the iniduals who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to provide appropriate assessment, support and advice.

But now Sarah, from Crewe, Cheshire, is happily married and undergoing IVF to have a baby thanks to a new drug, Kaftrio, approved for use in the UK in June . Now she is on a mission to meet scientists at Vertex - the pharmaceuticals company which created the lechanging treatment - and thank them.Have you got an inspiring story to tell  Email webnews@mirror Sarah said: “I just want to be able to tell them thank you and make them understand what this means.When I was  the topic of pregnancy came up with my doctors.It was very much a case of don’t get pregnant because you’re not well enough to carry a baby. I thought I would never have kids and I started to forget that side of my le. I thought I was ok with it but in hindsight I wasnapost because it’s something I’ve always wanted. I still can’t get my head around that it is a possibility for me now.  Sarah met her now husband, Stephen, in , just as she suffered a total spontaneous pneumothorax where both of her lungs collapsed. For years she had anticipated this near death experience, after she had grown up believing that the cystic fibrosis would kill her before she turned . She said: “I remember googling my le expectancy when I was about . At that time the average le expectancy for someone with cystic fibrosis was  years. “All through my teenage years I rebelled because I just didn’t care, I wanted to live my le and have fun because I thought I’d be dead by .  But that attitude changed for Sarah after meeting the love of her le, and she became determined to beat the cystic fibrosis and live her le with Stephen to the full. Trials for new drug Kaftrio were showing hugely promising results over in America after scientists had created a treatment made up of three parts which helped the body to use the protein enzyme in the proper way to rid cells of this sticky mucus. She said: “When I met my husband everything changed, I wanted to be around for a long time. “I started to think about cystic fibrosis and how it could stop me from having a future with him. I already knew he wanted children because we had been friends previously. I said to himthis is going to go somewhere I need to tell you something. I told him aposI donapost think I can have children and with my health the way it is I can’t see that changingapos.

I just canapost wait to see Stephenaposs face when I can finally tell him that Iaposm pregnant.Following the NHS bid to secure Kaftrio for patients in the UK, health experts estimate that nine in  people living with Cystic Fibrosis will benefit from this le-transforming drug.NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: “Since NHS staff delivered one of the fastest rollouts of Kaftrio in the world just over a year ago, the lives of thousands of patients with cystic fibrosis have been transformed. “Innovative treatments like Kaftrio are le-changing for patients and their families, and that is why the NHS has done all it can since we secured the deal for Kaftrio to ensure patients benefit as soon as possible. Now Sarah is urging people to help her get the hashtag #SarahMeetsVertex trending in an effort to see her dreams become a reality. Sarah said: “In some ways I feel so lucky to have cystic fibrosis. “When you are in the cystic fibrosis community you meet so many beautul people with this condition and they inspire you in so many ways with their strength. “I have lost incredible friends along the way. “I want to thank these scientists who have made this wonderful treatment for all the people who will come after us, who won’t have to go through what we have been through.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Le expectancyCystic fibrosisPeople\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the bigger issue is the presence of lead piping in old homes, as this can dissolve into drinking water and can be incredibly dangerous - especially for babies and children.  Water that comes directly from the mains hasnapost had the time to absorb lead from pipes yet, but itaposs a dferent story in the bathroom, where the combination of the lead and the water tank can be detrimental to your health.

The hot water is often stored in tanks that can be heated and cooled many times and could lead to the growth of bacteria such as legionella - so always choose the cold tap.

It was a fascinating experience.#The new orchestral work was inspired by Islay’s stunning natural environment, known for its rich terrain and peaty whisky.Five short thematic movements celebrate Islay’s sunrises and coastal shores, while giving a playful nod to the island’s abundant whisky industry.Helen added: #The work centres around The Rinns – a beautul peninsula overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.#My father used to talk about The Rinns of Islay, and as a child, I started to create stories and soundscapes linked to the island.#The work offers a visual, almost cinematic listening experience, with atmospheres and landmarks inspiring the visual imagination.#The work features on a new album Legends and Light Vol. , featuring works by seven composers.While many of the pieces are arranged for orchestral ensembles, listeners will also find the Highland bagpipes and Irish Uilleann pipes featured on the album, offering a deeply rewarding listening experience.Helen is delighted with feedback so far: #I’m thrilled with audiences’ responses to the music.#Listeners have tuned in from across the UK, the USA and as far afield as New Zealand, keeping Scotland on the international map for new music.#"},{"url":null,"title":"the show must go on","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum.

Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN.

We were - upso how we prepared last year was fine.“It was just how we dealt with situations like not scoring a try in the Wales  at the end of the first half and giving away three penalties in a row to hand momentum back to Wales, then in the second half, not dealing with the red card when we needed to adjust.“Confidence and belief is important, it gives you the ability to adapt and show character, but we have to deliver the detail as well. We can be better than this week, and we believe Wales will be better than they showed this week.“Being tough to beat is really important. It usually defines championship-winning teams, a strong defence in any sport. We know our defence is really entwined with our attack.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

Though Scotlands weather is reasonably mild, a fall to below zero degrees isnt a rare occurrence during winter – so lets take a look at what happens to your EV when it does.Can I drive my EV in cold weather Off the bat, should you drive an electric car in cold weather  Of course, you should. Electric cars go through the same rigorous testing procedures as petrol and diesel cars, so you neednt be afraid of piloting your EV in colder temperatures.Many electric cars are driven specically through arctic conditions to ensure that theyre able toproperly even in the harshest of conditions.So how can cold weather affect my electric car The changes youll notice surround the battery and the amount of range you get. Batteries use a chemical reaction to take on and release energy and its this process that is slowed down during cold weather. Its why electric cars offer their best possible battery performance in warmer weather, when this process can work in its most effective window.What does this mean  Essentially, you wont get as much range as you might in warmer temperatures. You could see up to a % loss in range, though for many cars this reduction will be around % of the claimed range.Is there anything I can do to help Of course. There are a few things you can do to boost the range of your electric car during colder temperatures. For instance, you could try covering your car – either with a plastic cover or within a garage – which will help to bring its temperature up.In addition, you could use your electric cars preconditioning system to warm the cars interior up ahead of time, so you dont have to rely on its battery to do this.When charging, most electric cars give you the option to pre-set a time and temperature for your car. For instance, you could set it to warm the cabin up to  degrees at am before you leave, ensuring its toasty warm but through using the cabled electricity instead of the battery. Though some cars will allow you to pre-condition without plugging in, this will draw more energy from the battery and leave you with less charge from the off.Are manufacturers doing anything to help EVs in cold weather Absolutely. A lot of EV manufacturers are now fitting their cars with heat pumps as a way of getting the very best from them during colder weather. Theyre used to warm the cars cabin more efficiently. They work by using thermal energy to turn a liquid refrigerant into a gas, which then leads to a rise in temperature. Because this is using less energy to heat up passing air, it helps to extend the cars range. Essentially, its the reverse of how your fridge works at home.Many electric cars are using this method at the moment, including Polestars  and the Volkswagen ID..What about charging  Is that affected by cold weather too Theres a chance that cold weather could affect public charging speeds. These charge points use a similar transition of power to the batteries inside your electric car, so theres a good chance that youll notice a slight change in how quickly you can charge.Plus, the rate of charge you get during colder temperatures will also depend on how cold your cars battery is. This affects how quickly it can accept a charge."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-independence-debate-faith","story":"It immediately becomes clear,not already self-evident, that Scotland choosing to be a sovereign state once again will not be an easy path, but nothing worth achieving ever is.Your correspondent Brian Higginsraises an important point in his letter: “… a Yes vote is not a vote for Nicola Sturgeon, or even a vote for the SNP, but a choice for self-determination”. This brings sharply into focus comments in the articles by Tom Gordon and Alex Neil regarding an EU referendum in Scotland. As an EU Remainer, I believe an independence referendum must only be that and cannot be taken as a de facto referendum on joining the EU. It would be completely undemocratic to do so and would disenfranchise those in Scotland who voted for Brexit – not a good start for a new country.If Scotland votes Yes to independence what exactly happens next  Only then can the people decide what type of country they want. During quite a y transition period, parties who previously opposed independence will reform with their prospectuses for the new Scotland and new parties will appear. The constitutional issue will be gone and it will be the very first time all parties will be focused only on what is good for Scotland and our continuing close relationship with the rest of the UK. Will the SNP hold together as a party given the glue of independence will have melted to reveal cracks in the structure  It cannot be assumed the existing devolved SNP Government will be solely leading negotiations with the UK. During transition, will there be a coalition government in Scotland comprised of existing political parties or will there be a Scottish general election The current independence debate tends to focus on the economic case because that is where there is vulnerability which is readily exploited by those who oppose Scottish independence. The truth is the economic case for independence cannot be compared to the status quo. It is fact against prediction – a prediction that can be tailored to any viewpoint. We have the resources, we have the people, have faith in yourself and others. Independence is about self-determination, doing it for yourself, proud of your country as a sovereign state taking its place at the world table, not sharing it as a minnow constantly hidden by a larger partner.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.A POSITION OF STRENGTHSEVERAL unionist correspondentsrelish whipping up fear about pensions in an independent Scotland. Three points must be made.First, the UK Government has affirmed its legal obligation to pay pensions regardless of where one lives. The Fraser of Allander Institute confirms this: “UK Government pays state pensions to those who retire abroad . Thereforethe UK Government pays the state pension to an inidual living in France, it would seem inconsistent for it not to pay the state pension to an inidual with a similar NICs record living in an independent Scotland.” It goes on to say that it is NICs, not citizenship, that determines eligibility.Second, Scotland will be negotiating from a position of strength when iding state assets and liabilities. Scotland won’t be liable for the £ billion UK debt. Scotland produces more than  per cent of UK oil and gas, the majority of renewable electricity and has % of the UK’s fresh water. It would be in rUK’s interests to negotiate in good faith.Third, post-independence, the Scottish Government will guarantee state pensions in the new Scottish currency and will have the power to increase pension payments, currently the lowest in the OECD, which it doesn’t have as a UK region.With independence, Scots will have a democratically elected government answerable to them, not a distant foreign government they didn’t vote for that ignores them. Who should they trust more Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.LIES ABOUT OUR WEALTHTHE slew of fearmongering letters about pensions in an independent Scotland ignores a basic fact.Since  Scotland has contributed more to the UK economy than England, Wales or Northern Ireland. And that was well before the North Sea oil boom. The UK Treasury and British Establishment have consistently lied to Scotland about its true wealth – although there have been some slips. In  Chief Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave admitted that Scotland had paid a massive £ billion more to the London Exchequer than it had got back since the Tories came to power in .In , with New Labour in power, the House of Commons Library produced a table showing Scotland would rank seventh in the world’s wealth league as measured by GDP per head, and the UK would rank th.In , the Daily Mail, hardly a cheerleader for Scottish independence, detailed in “Who are the real subsidy junkies ” how much more money per head UK regions got from the Treasury than they paid in tax. Northern Island got £,, North-east England £,, Wales £,, North-west England £,, Southwest England £, West Midlands £, East Midlands £. Scotland was last at £.In May  Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling conceded that Scotland’s oil revenue had been underwriting the UK’s budget deficit for decades.Lacking rational arguments, the Unionists simply rely on platitudinous smears.Carter Thomson, Craighouse, Isle of Jura.TIME INDYREF WAS PUT TO BEDTHE cat is certainly out of the bag now with regards to pension rights should the Scottish electorate ever swallow the nationalists propaganda and vote to leave the UK.It is now clear beyond any doubt that in an independent Scotland there should be no automatic assumption that the state pension would be at least at the same value as it is presently as part of the Union. The old hoary chestnut quoting Sir Steve Webb in  has been brought up to date and makes dire reading for the separatists, as of course pension payments are not part of some historic pot but in fact are paid from taxation received in the present.It is actually quite amusing that an SNP spokesperson still quotes Sir Steves  view that after independence people would be entitled to the pension contributions and this is the basis of their belief today.I recall that also in  the SNP confirmed thatit lost the referendum, which of course thank goodness it did, then that would be it settled for a generation, yet rather than honouring this and concentrating on governing the country in a competent manner, it never accepted the decision of the people of Scotland and immediately embarked on the Indyref campaign.No amount of spin or fake news will dig the nationalists out of this pensions hole and hopefully this will put the whole dreadful idea of another referendum being imposed on us any time soon to bed.James Martin, Bearsden.FALSE ACCLAIM FOR JOHNSONSIR Tom Hunterhas an enviable reputation as a business leader and as a person with a real concern for society. It is dficult to disagree with his headline statement, indeed for anyone with a modicum of decency, it is hard to imagine a time when an amoral chancer like Boris Johnson should have gained the power he has. However, Sir Tom seems to have fallen for the spin that Mr Johnson somehow did a wonderful job in the pandemic, particularly with regard to vaccination.Laying aside Mr Johnsons vacillation and  exceptionalism in the early stages of the pandemic, which probably resulted in the unnecessary deaths of thousands, his claim to have made a success of vaccination rings very hollow. All he did was take a chance with the lives of millions by its early approval and throw public moneyinto the roll-out of the vaccine. The real heroes of this saga are the scientists and NHS staff who worked incredible hours actually to design and administer it.They were rewarded with meaningless clapping and a derisory pay award.Mr Johnson, in the meantime, was also throwing our money to his cronies for often-useless PPI equipment or services.Let us have no more of this  acclamation.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.Read more: Why should we Scots jump off a clf into the unknown "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-high-time-got-away-notion-boy-jobs-girl-jobs","story":"Only five per cent of the UK’s pilots are female and a couple of my former colleagues argue that’s because there are \"boy jobs and girl jobs\" a sad echo of something Theresa May said about putting out the bins. But career choices are far more important than domestic arrangements, and flying is an attractive career, so why do so few young women aspire to it There’s little doubt that a lot of it comes down to the way children are conditioned when young. Girls are encouraged to be yielding and in the background, as in the old saying \"behind every successful man there is a woman\". Boys are encouraged to push themselves forward, as in Primark’s slogans on their boyswear: “Go for it” and “Born to win”. And children going on holiday, or watching a movie, will see that pilots are almost always men, and white men at that.There are plenty of parents and organisations that encourage girls and boys equally to be themselves and choose their own path, but there are also constant little nudges suggesting that some behaviours are appropriate for one sex, but not for the other, and that there are indeed boy jobs and girl jobs. If we’re to allow our youngsters genuine choice from the range of all available careers, we’ve got to get away from this indoctrination, which includes Primark’s sexist sloganeering for girls.I spent  years as a pilot with BA and  before that in the RAF, the last three as a Qualied Flying Instructor. In my experience, the female pilots I flew with were, on average, better aviators than their male counterparts. I suspect that was because they had to be better to overcome the many hurdles and biases their male colleagues never faced. So here’s a slogan for Primark to put on their sweaters: “Women make better pilots”.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.WELCOME PROGRESS ON CANNABIDIOLI WAS delighted to read that the Scottish Medicines Consortium, independent of the SNP Government, has licensed Epidyolexfor use in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex, a condition that is rare but massively debilitating for sufferers . Well done to you for placing the story on your front page.Notwithstanding, this is in my opinion what might be considered as a baby step in the slow progress that is being made, and must continue, in the battle to make researched and evidence-based cannabis and other \"illegal\" substances available in the treatment of health-related conditions, including mental health. Recent YouGov polls indicate that more than . million patients in the UK are currently consuming cannabis to help manage their diagnosed medical conditions. A further . million adult patients would like to discuss cannabis-based treatment options with their doctor.We should take a grown-up public health approach towards all drugs that are evidence-based and outcomes-focused. This could deliver an intended consequence in erting resources away from prosecution and enforcement and towards prevention to keep everyone safer.Douglas McBean, Edinburgh.REMEMBER ANOTHER TIMELESS TREASUREI WAS very interested in your report about the work to repair and preserve the Queen Mary and was heartened to find therein an attitude of preserving heritage wherever possible . The Clyde-built sailing ship Falls of Clyde, currently in Honolulu, is another very special vessel deserving preservation, although of a completely dferent character and history. She too is a “timeless treasure”.Having visited her there and been immensely impressed by the skill and care that had restored her to her original glory, with help from Sir William Lithgow, I fell completely in love with her and was delighted to find that plans, by a group called Falls of Clyde International, are well advanced to bring her back to her birthplace. The intention is not simply to have another “museum exhibit”, but to fit her with green power and even set her sailing again to earn her keep on Fairtrade routes and by training apprentices and those who wish to experience the old ways of sailing. Other income streams are also planned.Just recently, I came across an article in a glossy magazine headed “The Five Lives of a Grand Old Lady” about Falls of Clyde, with old sepia photographs taken by her second mate. It explains the five lives that Falls had which make her unique – British trader, Hawaiian sugar transport, conversion to a tanker with steam power, floating filling station for ships and finally, restoration for the Bishop Maritime Museum in Honolulu.Now she has the chance of a sixth le, back in her birthplace, an icon of our heritage linked to an active, income-generating, green future. This must be the perfect example of what I recently heard called “green re-industrialisation\". I too believe that “you don’t sink history”, and have seen too much bulldozed in my long le.Information on her and the plans can be found on the website foci.scot.L McGregor, Falkirk.THE FATE OF SCOTLANDS ELIZABETHAS another amateur historian I feel the need to respond to Tom Irvine’s letterin which he states that Robert the Bruce’s second we, Elizabeth de Burgh, was captured near Kildrummy by Edward I’s forces. In fact Elizabeth was taken into captivity in Tain, Easter Ross, which is a considerable distance from Kildrummy.Queen Elizabeth had sought sanctuary in the church of Saint Duthac along with Bruce’s two sisters, his daughter from his first marriage Marjorie, and the Countess of Buchan.The Earl of Ross captured them there and then handed them over to the English. They were then sent to Edward I at Lanercost Priory to decide what their fate should be.Graham Sutherland, Edinburgh.ALE FELLOW WELL METFOLLOWING on from the recent Napoleonic palindrome , I remember a friend, after imbibing more alcohol than was sensible, saying to me: “Regal was I ere I saw lager”.Brian Logan, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-236-todays-wordle-february-10-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter P and ends with the letter E.It contains  vowels.It means to stop momentarily.You need to run to the bathroom, so you do this to your show while you are out of the room.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

We’ve had some experiences against some top sides both home and away, and we’ve shown resilience in those games.“We’ve not won them all but I believe the tests we had at Twickenham and in Paris last year sets us up this week for what will be a great challenge in a full stadium at one of the best venues in the world.“It would be hard to top what we did in Paris but the challenge this weekend is a bigger one in many ways because of our history in Cardf and the fact it’s a full crowd, which it wasn’t in Paris.”Wales have been written off by many observers after last weekend’s - defeat away to Ireland, but Townsend expects them to be a stronger team this Saturday.“Normally, you’re better in your second game in the Six Nations,” he said. “In the first game things didn’t usually go smoothly for you, soyou’re going up against a top side like Ireland, who have got lots of momentum and you’re playing them away from home, you may struggle to get into the game early on but I felt the second quarter and in parts of the second half, Wales were the equal of Ireland.“We know they’ll be better for having that game and they’re a top side with great players throughout the .”Townsend has made five changes to the team that started last weekend’s win over England, including the introduction of centre Sione Tuipulotu in place of his club-mate Sam Johnson.“Sione brings a dferent dimension,” said Townsend. “He’s a dferent player to Samand Cam , the other players that were in consideration for .

We’ve picked combinations we believe can work against the way Wales play and the way we want to play.”Townsend has changed his entire front row, with Pierre Schoeman, WP Nel and Stuart McInally replacing Zander Fagerson, George Turner and Rory Sutherland.“Regarding the front row, we looked at getting a fresh front row on at a certain point in the game last week and it’s now their opportunity to start,” said the head coach. “We’ll be looking to bring on a reserve front-row together like we did last week.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I don’t care so much about the show because I look at is a sport and from a competitive point of view.“Obviously, it is not the easiest to be in the shoes of the referee, or Michael’s shoes, but he has done a great job, particularly after filling in for [former race director] Charlie Whiting who died so suddenly.“Michael has been very focused and determined to do a good job.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

However, the Prime Minister — currently on a charm offensive as part of a mission to restore his reputation — has said he expects the last domestic rules in England could end earlythe data permits. Boris Johnson made the announcement on Wednesday, as Robin Swann was still waiting for an expert assessment on whether he can press ahead with lting restrictions in Northern Ireland.Read MoreRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NIEarlier this week, the Health Minister told a press briefing that he wants to lt most, “ not all” remaining measures. Key to all of this, however, is the legal and public health advice he receives. It is understood that even as late as Wednesday night he hadn’t been given the green light to press ahead with relaxations and it isn’t entirely clear what this will entaillawyers tell him he has the power to act without Executive approval. If this proves to be the case, Mr Swann then has to decide which restrictions he will lt.Among the rules that remain are the controversial Covid certicate scheme for nightclubs, a minimum self-isolation period for people who test positive, a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces, and the regular use of lateral flow tests. Given Mr Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, there was hope that Mr Swann would follow suit, but a spokeswoman from the Department of Health on Wednesday night poured cold water on any such suggestion. “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland,” she said. “All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, while this may be Mr Swann’s preferred position, his hands may be forced on the matterMr Johnson scraps lateral flow testsin England. To date, NI’s supply has come from England and it will be dficult for the UUP minister to make a case to the public that they should pay for LFTs as it is unlikely Westminster will pay outthey aren’t in use across the water. The only other alternative would be for Stormont to pick up the cost — and given the current political instability, it’s anyone’s guess whether that would even be possible.As it stands, Covid- is still re in Northern Ireland.Given current testing arrangements, the actual number of positive cases is likely to be signicantly higher than those on the Department of Health’s dashboard. Realistically, how many people are actually recording positive LFT results Mercully, Omicron has not turned out to be as dangerous as first feared — at least to most people. But there are still tens of thousands of people here who are clinically extremely vulnerable and for whom the vaccinations may not provide effective protection.Many have had to shield and make extraordinary sacrices to stay safe over the past two years. While the wider population is looking forward to a e to normal, it is these very changes and relaxations that will force the clinically vulnerable to retreat even more from the world.Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannBoris JohnsonMore On Department of HealthNI health trusts short of almost  permanent consultants, according to BMA vacancy reportMore than , calls to Leline helpline in Northern Ireland last year, new figures reveal PremiumRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NICoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow There’s still a lot of work to be done to deal with mental health issues of young people in NI, says Koulla YiasoumaMost ReadFamily#s tribute following tragic death of QUB student Conall McGuinness - ‘It was a pleasure to have had him for the  years we did’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alightCoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow Belfast woman scammed out of £, as PSNI warn of Valentine’s Day fraudsters‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageHealth trust chiefs plead with governments for funds to deliver servicesMan accused of threatening sex workers at gunpoint refused bailNorthern Ireland’s most romantic locations this Valentine’s DayFormer PUP deputy leader John Kyle joins the UUPLatestPolice probe after two white-tailed eagles reintroduced to England found deadMen with extra pounds of fat may be more likely to break a boneChief Medical Officer Sir Gregor Smith apologises for reposting political tweetMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageGregor Townsend believes Scots can build on opening win and banish Cardf blues,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

leader has pleaded with governments for the funds needed to deliver services.Neil Guckian, chief executive of Western Health Trust, said Stormont and Westminster must recognise trusts are coming out of a pandemic and facing “massive backlogs”.Dr Cathy Jack, chief executive of Belfast Health Trust, said the system had needed reform before the pandemic, adding that hospitals and community services remain under “signicant strain”.There has been far-reaching damage done, some of which we have not yet even assessed, and this is in the context of a pandemic which is not yet overCathy Jack“The main and exasperating factor is the really tired workforce with additional Covid sickness absence and the long-term vacancies that we carry,” she said.Continuing outbreaks in care homes curtail the ability to discharge from hospital, she added, while high levels of Covid mean that community services cannot cope with demand and emergency departments are “relentlessly busy”.She said social distancing and personal protective equipment have “slowed up work” and created additional barriers in caring for those in need.“The demand for intensive care has reduced … and there are signs of staff ing to work as community transmission lessens, but I wish I could be more hopeful that our recovery will be quick, that is simply not the case,” she said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines

non-recurrent monies,” he said.“I think it’s really, really important that we would work to try to keep that.”However he warned that any Budget is “only as good as the numbers in the Budget”.Mr Guckian said the health service has the same inflationary pressures as every other organisation, as well as the demographic pressures of an ageing population.“If the Budget is neutral in terms of inflation only, it means we can’t offer increases to our existing packages of care, for example, it impacts on our ability to address need – an -year-old person consumes  times the health and social care resources of a younger person.“As we have more -year-olds in our population, we need more of a Budget to meet the needs or the needs aren’t met.“I would plead to the Government, I would plead to national Government to recognise we’re coming out of a pandemic, there are massive backlogs in our systems which need resources as well in terms of waiting lists and all our services, so please give us the resources we need to deliver our services.”Most ReadFamily#s tribute following tragic death of QUB student Conall McGuinness - ‘It was a pleasure to have had him for the  years we did’South

And while this semi-autobiographical film is about the Troubles and the effect it had on the people who lived here, it#s also about how le went on regardless and people tried to make the best of things - going to school, visiting grandparents, worrying about brown envelopes - in one of the most authentic aspects of the film.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The telling of the story through the eyes of Buddy, an innocent child, adds crucial objectivity and a view of things through the eyes of someone without the cynicism of adults or the need to weigh up the options like his parents. Instead, he#s more worried about his fondness for his classmate and how whatever turn his le takes may affect her and their relationship.Buddy#s grandfather, played by the inimitable Ciaran Hinds, listens to him talk about his crush and schools him on the topic of love while Pa, played by Jamie Dornan, has to listen to a local heavyweight who threatens the family#s safety. later, Buddy worries thatthe family moves away, his accent won#t be understood. He is assured: If they can#t understand you, then they#re not listening.It#s a wider point, made to ying degrees throughout the film, about how best to relate to each other and while not the whole picture, plays into the broad brush subjectivity that means Belfast can be enjoyed by all.Read MoreBelfast: Branagh’s ode to city goes up against western hit The Power Of The Dog at the OscarsWill it be seventh heaven for Branagh this time at Oscars Most ReadFamily#s tribute following tragic death of QUB student Conall McGuinness - ‘It was a pleasure to have had him for the  years we did’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alightCoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow Belfast woman scammed out of £, as PSNI warn of Valentine’s Day fraudsters‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingLatest Northern IrelandPolice Federation NI chief Mark Lindsay announces retirementMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageHealth trust chiefs plead with governments for funds to deliver servicesMan accused of threatening sex workers at gunpoint refused bailNorthern Ireland’s most romantic locations this Valentine’s DayLatestRiyad Mahrez follows in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero and Lionel MessiHuman Rights Commission calls to address legislative gaps to tackle hate crimePolice Federation NI chief Mark Lindsay announces retirementPolice probe after two white-tailed eagles reintroduced to England found deadMen with extra pounds of fat may be more likely to break a bone,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Scottish football commentators were facing a nightmare ahead of Wednesday night’s Scottish Championship clash, in a fixture that wouldn#t usually raise an eyebrow. Michael McKenna scored a late equalising penalty to secure a point for Arbroath in their - draw with -man visitors Hamilton. But it was the confusion around the four players whose surname is Hamilton - in a game featuring Hamilton - that really stood out. The home side fielded three in Chris Hamilton, Jack Hamilton and Colin Hamilton, while visitors Hamilton also handed a start to Jamie Hamilton.Arbroath vs Hamilton Accies - Team NewsIt#s as you were for the Lichties with only James Craigen absent as he serves his suspension, both Nicky Low and Michael McKenna are fit! pic WprYzGvGLC— Arbroath FCFebruary ,  Things could have been much worse for those commentating on the gameany of the Hamilton’s managed to get on the scoresheet. Daniel O’Reilly’s opener for Hamilton was cancelled out by Nicky Low’s first-half penalty before Andrew Ryan’s goal put the visitors ahead for a second time. In stoppage time, Jack Hamilton was fouled in the penalty area with Lewis Spence shown a red card for violent conduct. McKenna then made no mistake with the spot-kick to ensure that Arbroath maintained a five-point lead at the top of the Championship table.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs. Mairead ed and performed like she never had been away.Senior youth worker Yvonne Maguire congratulated everyone connected with the production mdash the cast members, production team, friends of Patrician, parents, and families for supporting members, children and young people.She extended a sincere thank you to Mairead for standing in at the last minute and also paid tribute to Shona, who had worked so hard in preparing for the performance and regrettably did not get the opportunity to star.A recording of Shona singing will be available on Facebook.The principal cast members were: Mairead OrsquoHare , Aaron Mullan , Aedan OrsquoHare , Annie May OrsquoHare , Eamon OrsquoHare , Eva Bailie , Tyler Fung , Zoe Gaines .Chorus, dancers, monkeys, trees and crows: Caitie Cunlfe, Caragh Moore, Conal McDowell, Ella Grace Cunlfe, Emily Douglas, Georgia Savage, Jack McDonald, Katie Fegan, Kayleigh Rogers, Lilly Boyd, Maria Rooney, Megan Megahey, Molly Boyd, Molly Madine, Oisin OrsquoHare, Poppy Baggley, Poppy Woodall.Patrician Youth Centre would also like to thank the following staff team and friends for making the production possible: Caitriona Smyth, Anthony Frew, Bridin Wells, Eamonn Hanlon, Charlie Hanlon, David McBennett, Melissa Poland, Paddy Watters, Mark Hassett, Anna Murray and Teresa Sweeney.Thanks are also extended other team members and the centre trainee leader membership who supported the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Sea.jpg","title":"Drive for better sea swimming facilities  ","story":"A SERIES of measures to improve the safety of sea swimmers in Newcastle have been suggested to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority has been asked to address the needs of the increasing numbers who enjoy swimming at the resortrsquos harbour.Council officials met recently with Mournes councillor Laura Devlin who is working to secure improved access to the water and the needs of those who enjoy cold water swimming.Cllr Devlin said while sea swimming has always been popular in the resort, there is an increasing number of people taking to the water as a result of Covid which prompted many people across the district to be more active.She said Newcastlersquos Harbour Heritage Association is bringing many people who use services at the harbour together to provide them with a ldquounied voice with the group including representatives of the sea swimming community.ldquoCold water therapy is now an established activity and the coronavirus pandemic will unfortunately have a lasting impact on mental health, continued Cllr Devlin.ldquoThis type of therapy is seen as a successful line of defence and even treatment for many, notwithstanding the superb physical benefits and enjoyment that cold water swimming brings.Cllr Devlin says there are many activities at Newcastle harbour which can sometimes lead to a congested slipway, explaining that there are ldquosignicant safety concerns when swimmers, boats and jet-skis are in the water at once.The local councillor, who met recently with council officials and was joined by local sea swimmer Fiona Davey, has also highlighted parking problems at the harbour which she said are ldquocontinuing to deteriorate.She continued: ldquoI have also consulted with The Harbour Heritage Association and we agreed a list of issues that need to be addressed which the local authority which is considering improvements to the water access point on the harbour side of the Rock Pool or at the Back Shore.ldquoAn extension of the ramp leading to the water is also required to allow for disability access, while a handrail to assist people entering and exiting the water as well as hooks for clothes and storage, and a seating area for changing is also required.Council officials have also been asked to provide buoys near the pier to section off the area for those jumping into the water and sea swimming in general.Cllr Devlin also highlighted the need for height markers on the pier wall in order that those who jump into the water will know the depth, explaining the water depth can be an issue during the summer months.Council officials have also been asked to provide distance markers, so swimmers know how far out they are.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThis is a flavour of our asks and really is just a starting point. I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole.

The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line.

This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population. The wet and extremely hot weather meant that most of our barn owl nest sites failed, so we were thrilled to hear this news.ldquoLuckily, this pair couldnrsquot have chosen a more sympathetic farm to set up home with wild bird cover, meadows and mature hedgerows providing plentul foraging habitat and food for barn owls to thrive.She continued: ldquoWith fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, farmers and landowners play a key role in securing their future.ldquoBy working together, we can help protect precious nest sites, monitor these beautul birds and provide help and advice on owl-friendly farming.The chicks were kindly ringed by David Galbraith, a licenced volunteer ringer from the British Trust for Ornithology .This will generate important information on the birdsrsquo survival, productivity and movement - and is non-invasive as the birds remain sleepy during the process.Barn owls are legally protected and can be sensitive to disturbance, soyou find a nest site, please leave it alone and get in touch with Ulster Wildle.Tell-tale signs to look for include distinctive whitewash pings, feathers and regurgitated pellets of bones and fur.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13462534.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey crossed the busy A and followed a track for the slippery descent where the old set of steps have finally disintegrated and through bare autumnal woodland onto part of the Ridgeway Golf Club, where the ground was glistening white with a thick carpet of overnight frost. After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It felt like the home that I had never known,” said Ceri. “We just want to raise our kids, run our business and live a normal le,” she said.Read More Co Armagh man banned from keeping snakes after Boa found with scale rot and mite infestationPortadownDurhamEngland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsCarrickfergus man threatened to petrol bomb neighbour’s home...NewsCo Armagh man banned from keeping snakes after Boa found wit...NewsWoman cautioned after boy injured in Lurgan crash...NewsCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsMost PopularWhat’s included in the Marks and Spencer Valentine’s Day mea...RecommendedBest Valentine’s Day gts for her UK : romantic gt id...RecommendedAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is about to be back in stoc...RecommendedBest dog beds : stylish, comfortable dog beds for all ki...RecommendedMonthly flower subscriptions UK : our favourites, includ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Farmer case studies show how a nature and climate friendly farming approach has led to more profitable farm businesses as well as delivering benefits for the environment.It also identies the support farmers need to transform the sector and for all farmers to reap the rewards of nature-friendly farming.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our farm, we have boosted our income through nature-friendly practices. We only coppice our hedgerows every  years, which has increased our ability to sequester carbon and benefit the local wildle. But this change of approach requires government support and funding that is accessible to farmers.” Hedgerows are important for protecting wildle.Northern Ireland ranks th worst in the world for bioersity loss and it is the only part of the UK and Ireland without legally binding climate legislation that would enable a transition to a more sustainable economy. Last week for the first time ever a Climate Change Bill passed through the consideration stage at the Northern Ireland Assembly and is scheduled to pass through two further Assembly stages before it passes into law.John Martin, Head of Policy and Advocacy RSPB NI commented: “Northern Ireland can no longer afford not to legislate on climate. We are delighted to see that the Climate Change Bill has now been amended to include an additional clause on nature-based solutions and the addition of a Just Transition Fund for agriculture, but it must also align with the environmental ambitions of future agriculture policy which is set to change for the first time in a generation. “Farmers are responsible for managing % of the land in Northern Ireland. They can protect, restore and enhance our natural ecosystems which underpin resilient communities, economies and landscapes. Therefore, the government must use this opportunity to effectively fund farmers to deliver these benefits while still maintaining profitable and successful farm businesses.”A survey commissioned by RSPB NI last year showed overwhelming support from four in five MLAs to financially reward farmers for the delivery of environmental public goods. Public goods can include clean water, improved air and soil quality, climate adaptation and mitigation, and enhanced bioersity. Simon Best, a mixed arable farmer from County Armagh commented: “We have incorporated bioersity-friendly habitats on around % of our farmed land. I also undertake woodland, wetland and minimum hedgerow management in order to support nature.“We have witnessed an increase in bioersity, recording the presence of barn owns, breeding lapwing, otters and numerous other bird species. I believe Northern Ireland needs to be ambitious in its targets to ensure that we see progress and action as soon as possible.” More on this story: https:www.rspb.org.uk about-the-rspb at-home-and-abroad northern-ireland policyinnorthernireland "},{"url":null,"title":"maze must be developed mla ","story":"Larne man given Probation for assault   Lisburn police issue scam warningNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsMaze must be developed - MLASDLP Foyle MLA Sinéad McLaughlin has said the failure to develop the former Maze prison site cannot be allowed to continue.By Julie-Ann SpenceThursday, th February , : pm  \"       \"  Maz Regeneration siteShe was speaking as the Assembly’s Executive Office Committee received a briefing on the development of the site.SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney has long been calling for the site to be developed for the benefit of the local community.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We have heard numerous plans and proposals to develop this site come forward over the years, but the inability to reach an agreement has cost the public a key facility the North millions in potential funding.“While serving as Deputy First Minister Mark Durkan helped negotiate the ownership of key military sites from the Ministry of Defence to the Executive so that they could be used to benefit people here. Sites like Crumlin Road Gaol have been redeveloped and become a jewel in our tourism crown, but still the Maze lies empty, despite the SDLP’s vision. Like too many key projects, the Maze prison site is yet another casualty of the dys that has permeated The Executive Office for the  years it has been led by Sinn Féin and the DUP. They have been more interested in using the Maze site to score political points against each other than to see it’s full potential realised for the benefit of local people. The huge opportunities this site presents have been stled as a direct result of their own self-interest and lack of vision to make real change.”Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney said: “For as long as I have been a public representative I have been urging action to make this site a hub for everyone in Lagan Valley and beyond. There is a real opportunity for this to become a flagship project that could both create new jobs and attract visitors to this area.“We are currently spending a fortune on the upkeep of this site and getting nowhere. We need to see a real sea change in the approach to the Maze siteit is ever going to realise its full potential and I hope the upcoming election s local MLAs and Ministers who are determined to deliver it for the people in this area.”: MLA calls for ‘creative thinking’ to revitalise townsSDLP  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsCarrickfergus man threatened to petrol bomb neighbour’s home...NewsCo Armagh man banned from keeping snakes after Boa found wit...NewsWoman cautioned after boy injured in Lurgan crash...NewsCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsMost PopularWhat’s included in the Marks and Spencer Valentine’s Day mea...RecommendedBest Valentine’s Day gts for her UK : romantic gt id...RecommendedAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is about to be back in stoc...RecommendedBest dog beds : stylish, comfortable dog beds for all ki...RecommendedMonthly flower subscriptions UK : our favourites, includ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
