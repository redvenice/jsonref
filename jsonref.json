The report added: ‘Social, romantic and sexual relationships are increasingly experienced online, and sexting is seen as an alternative as well as a precursor to intercourse.’Yet the study gave no credit to the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, the campaign to promote contraception and sex education launched in 1998 by Tony Blair, for the huge fall in pregnancy among under-18s in England and Wales since 2007.           Teenagers are \u0027more interested in families, Facebook and careers than in sex\u0027 (file photo)It noted that the campaign, which led to a rise in teenage abortion, had been ditched in 2010 and added: ‘Teen conception rates have declined despite the closure of contraceptive services across the country, which may in turn be hampering young people’s ability to access contraceptive advice and support when needed. \u0027Therefore, while the uptake of long-acting methods of contraception will undoubtedly have had an impact, our research indicates that this alone cannot be responsible for the ongoing and significant decline in teenage pregnancy rates.’  Only a third of 16-18-year-olds that took survey said they had lost their virginity (file image) The findings by BPAS, which carried out 70,000 abortions in England and Wales last year, and which campaigns for abortion on demand, are among the first to try to explain the drop in teen pregnancy. In 1998, the year in which Mr Blair launched his campaign, there were 47.1 pregnancies for every 1,000 girls under 18 in England and Wales.By 2007, the level had declined only to 41.6, higher than in the early 1980s. However after 2007, the year in which social media took off, teen pregnancy rates started to fall fast, and in 2016 there were just 18.9 pregnancies among every 1,000 girls under 18.The BPAS report was based on focus groups of 16- to 18-year-olds, together with a poll of more than 1,000 young people of the same age, both run by YouGov. Drinks industry body the Portman Group paid for the surveys.BPAS researcher Katherine O’Brien explained: ‘This new so-called Generation Sensible – a term that was met with pride, derision, and disbelief by our focus group participants – is one which is firmly focused on their education and careers.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/13/4E461E1700000578-0-image-m-8_1531658180051.jpg","title":"Great Western Railway guard reduces comedian tears forcing mobility scooter","story":"    Tanyalee Davis, 47, as visibly upset in a film recorded by her partner A comedian was left sobbing on a train after a guard ordered her to move her mobility scooter out of the wheelchair area - before making a public announcement about her.Addressing all passengers on the train as the couple headed for Norwich from Plymouth, on Sunday, the Great Western Railway (GWR) employee said the train would be stopping because of 47-year-old Tanyalee Davis.The comedian, 47, was ordered to move so a woman\u0027s pram could go in the disabled space.Ms Davis explained the woman had a newborn but had hurt her arm so could not hold her baby.When she refused, because she could not do so, she claims she was \u0027harassed\u0027 and \u0027shamed\u0027. She said the guard announced over the tannoy: \u0027We\u0027re going to be stopping in Taunton indefinitely because the woman in the mobility scooter is causing problems.\u0027They are videotaping me and threatening to put it on the internet.\u0027    Tanyalee Davis, 47, was forced to move her mobility scooter on a train.

Perhaps she did not want to.\u0027I felt I needed stay with her and that she needed me. I asked her if she wanted me to stay and she said \u0027yes\u0027.\u0027I am glad I did - even if it was only to offer her a little support.\u0027The fact that she did not hand the phone to anyone else showed to me that she needed it.\u0027Ms Russell advised the \u0027very scared\u0027 12-year-old to go to the room least affected by smoke, shut the windows, stay low and cover her mouth.She went on: \u0027After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing.\u0027I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button.          Heartache: Jessica\u0027s family, pictured, handed out posters of her in the days after the fire as they initially believed she was missing\u0027I was torn as what best to do. I eventually ended the call when the line fell silent.\u0027Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless.\u0027When people are pleading with you, saying do not want to die and I cannot physically do anything to help them it is very hard.\u0027I can pass on all the information but I cannot actually do anything - that is very tough.\u0027The information that Jessica had fled to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of the youngster. Ms Russell revealed that, not long after the call ended, she became aware that the advice to callers had been changed from \u0027stay-put\u0027 to attempt to evacuate.She said she did not recall ringing previous callers back with the changed advice, just answering the \u0027relentless\u0027 calls and updating new callers.

There was no information from the crews on the ground.\u0027She added: \u0027Control room officers normally stay on the phone for FSG (fire survival guidance) calls but my staff just couldn\u0027t stay on the phone for that long, so we had to be efficient in giving advice, then move onto the next call as we had people waiting.\u0027We couldn\u0027t follow the policy in these circumstances and there is no amount of training that would have prepared anybody for that.\u0027At just after 2.45am, she was told by a senior manager that advice had changed and callers should now be told to get out of the building.She wrote this on a piece of paper which she showed to phone operators who were busy taking calls.\u0027My feeling about this decision was that it should have been made sooner,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/15/4E60524700000578-0-image-a-32_1531922875119.jpg","title":"David Spade pays tribute sister law Kate Spade recalls girlfriends dressed her","story":"    Tribute: David spade recalled how \u0027lovely\u0027 and \u0027beautiful\u0027 his late sister-in -law Kate Spade was while appearing on Good Morning America Wednesday (above)  Family: He told a story about how his girlfriends over the years would always buy a new wardrobe if they knew that they would be meeting or seeing the designer (left in 1997, right in 2012)\u0027I remember when we used to hang out, it\u0027s funny because every girl I was with or anyone I knew would dress differently when they were going to see Katie,\u0027 said Spade. \u0027They would bring their A-game, it was very sweet.

I asked her if she wanted me to stay and she said \u0027yes\u0027.\u0027I am glad I did - even if it was only to offer her a little support.\u0027The fact that she did not hand the phone to anyone else showed to me that she needed it.\u0027Ms Russell advised the \u0027very scared\u0027 12-year-old to go to the room least affected by smoke, shut the windows, stay low and cover her mouth.She went on: \u0027After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing.\u0027I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button.

It was less intimidating than the grand “castle keep” way in on Cromwell Road.“All the data we have shows that it is much more attractive to non-traditional museumgoers,” said Hunt. “It is less, frankly, scary.”The figures were also boosted by the success of its Pink Floyd show, which overtook David Bowie to become the museum’s most popular music exhibition.Hunt said there was a buzz around the museum but visitor numbers were not everything. “It is wonderful to get to 4 million visitors, but my ambition is not to get to 5 million visitors. My ambition is to make sure we are doing more with education and design and to make sure our scholarship and research is where it needs to be.”The V\u0026ampA opened its new £55m porcelain-tiled piazza and entrance, together with underground exhibition space, last June. Designed by Amanda Levete Architects, it was the successor to the polarising 1997 design by Daniel Libeskind, once described as “the Guggenheim in Bilbao turned on its side and then beaten senseless with a hammer”. Plans for the Spiral were eventually pulled in 2004.The busyness and buzziness of the V\u0026ampA is a long way from the turn of the millennium when visitor numbers fell to 1.22 million and the public struggled to understand what the museum was for.Among the plans for 2019 will be exhibitions dedicated to food, opening in May, and cars, opening in October.Hunt said the V\u0026ampA had been unashamedly populist since it opened in 1852. “Whether it is our Fabergé exhibitions of the past, or Britain Can Make It in 1946, we’ve had this long history of attractive, popular exhibitions and I hope these will be in the same lineage as that whilst not giving an inch in the scholarship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a76e3d598c4b0b045a3fd591820bcc8b852b69/0_297_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e344f7979c9bd0aeccaead3ef375bb2f","title":"easyjet raises profits forecast spring revenues soar","story":"Growth comes despite air traffic control strikes and lower demand amid hot weather EasyJet has raised its profits forecast after soaring revenues in the spring, despite air traffic control strikes and the unusually hot weather dampening demand. Johan Lundgren, the airline’s chief executive, said costs from disruption had grown by £25m compared with the same period in 2017. Air traffic control strikes meant more than 2,600 flights were cancelled and left easyJet having to find 70,000 hotel rooms for stranded passengers.Lundgren said easyJet would make a legal complaint to the European commission as it and other airlines, including IAG and Ryanair, seek a solution to the strikes, which are primarily French-based but affect overflying routes. Lundgren said the heatwave and World Cup had dampened demand and would have an effect on the summer season. “We have taken into consideration slightly weaker late yields, for the quarter to come.”However, the airline said it anticipated higher annual profits of £550m-£590m, as it unveiled the first in a fleet of bigger, quieter planes from Airbus. Lundgren said the A321neo would help easyJet’s growth at airports where noise and capacity is an issue, such as Heathrow. The plane can carry 49 more passengers than the A320, its previous largest plane, and the airline has converted an order for 30 A320s to the larger model.  Lundgren said: “What it allows us to do is grow at airports that are slot-constrained.” That includes London Gatwick, where easyJet is the biggest airline, but also Heathrow, where it hopes to operate after the building of its third runway, which parliament voted to approve last month. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who was aboard the first flight of easyJet’s A321neo from Gatwick to the Farnborough airshow, said: “This aircraft is typical of what’s going to allow aviation to continue growing, and become more environmentally and community friendly: it uses less fuel, makes less noise and carries more people.”  Speaking at Farnborough, the Airbus chief executive, Tom Enders, said the delivery of the plane was a “new chapter … I’m sure it will accelerate easyJet’s growth.” He said the outlook remained strong for aerospace despite “all the political headwinds and craziness that happens in the world”.Enders said the week’s parliamentary turmoil over Brexit had reinforced Airbus’s resolve to take contingency measures. He said: “I thought that Chequers was going in the right direction and now we see that unravelling again so all the more reason for us to take serious decisions … preparing to cope with this.”He added: “Our major concern is in the area of what it does to our just-in-time logistical chains – this is why we are very worried, why we are now activating contingency plans, to create some buffers on inventory, to at least be able for a certain period after the exit happens to mitigate the effects of that.”Enders said curtailing freedom of movement was another major worry for Airbus, with 80,000-90,000 journeys taken by the company’s staff alone between Britain and Europe each year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ee8272f43c3d1e5e99924651956dea164c8c0c/0_273_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d468b1fe46239eef4fe43fb897db6bc","title":"shareholders unconvinced more women should be in top jobs mps told","story":"Investors more interested in green issues than gender equality, companies sayShareholders are more concerned about environmental issues than promoting women to senior positions in boardrooms and some are not convinced that businesses need more women in top jobs, company executives have told MPs.At a hearing on women in executive management, the House of Commons’ women and equalities committee quizzed representatives from the water company Severn Trent, packaging company Smurfit Kappa, car parts and bike retailer Halfords, the infrastructure firm Stobart Group and housebuilder Persimmon.All said investors asked more questions about the environment and sustainability than how to get more women into boardrooms.Sarah Bentley, the chief customer officer at Severn Trent, whose chief executive is Liv Garfield – one of only six female FTSE 100 CEOs – said some shareholders had yet to be convinced of the benefits of having more women in executive roles.Bentley said a number of investors recognised that having a more erse executive team added value, but said: “I wouldn’t say that’s true of all of our investors.”  She added: “Obviously investors care about the performance of the business ... We’ve obviously got quite a lot of female talent. They want to make sure that we’ve got the right quality and calibre of talent.”Jonathan Crookall, the people director at Halfords, said: “It’s a growing topic but it’s not at the top of the agenda yet.”Analysis from Cranfield University this week showed a sharp drop in the number of women holding the most senior jobs at FTSE 250 firms, and static numbers at FTSE 100 companies. There are only six female CEOs in the FTSE 250 and the number of all-male boards has risen to 10.Several of the executives stressed the importance of mentoring, and Bentley revealed she was receiving mentoring to prepare for a CEO role. Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, said in reality appointments were often not based on meritocracy and that “the systems in place are skewed towards one type of people, usually men”.Stobart Group is one of 10 FTSE 250 firms with all-male boards. Kate Willard, its head of corporate projects, told MPs the company was in the process of rectifying this as it recruits a new chair, chief financial officer and two non-executive directors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47350edb3d8b2bfbf0b4a191e69b47232bd73e4b/0_72_4766_2860/master/4766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44f03f1dc1601361352ca49a7368e57d","title":"hard right left centre party politics blair clinton","story":"In both Britain and the United States, the resurgent left represents the best antidote to inequality, stagnating living standards and insecure employment. Yet it is increasingly clear that if the movements represented chiefly by Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders fail, it will be the authoritarian xenophobic right that will fill the vacuum.In the growing turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic, the old politics of Blairite and Clintonian centrism have no answers to a popular desire to break with a rotten social order. They have maintained a degree of influence not because they represent a massive constituency of public opinion, but because of long-established networks in their respective political parties, in the media and among economic elites. They are incapable of defeating the rightwing populism that menaces both nations: that mission, the outcome of which is uncertain, falls to the left.Consider our respective political plights. A hard-right plutocrat is the most powerful man on Earth: a man who calls white supremacists “very fine people”, who demanded a total ban on Muslims entering the US, who separated crying children from their parents and locked them in cages, and has adopted far-right tropes about Europe “losing its culture” because of immigration. His elevation to the presidency was deemed a laughable impossibility: the Clinton camp reacted with “giddy disbelief” when he became the Republican frontrunner in early 2016.Yes, Clinton suffered misogyny, and Russia undoubtedly preferred Trump and acted on it: yet the latter factor has become a Clintonian comfort blanket, a means to avoid a post mortem on the politics of the Democratic failure. As veteran Democratic Representative Barbara Lee told me just after Donald Trump’s “American carnage” inauguration speech, there was no shortage of political mobilisation against Trump in the US election: “What I didn’t see in there was the clarity of what our platform was.” Indeed, as a prominent US progressive campaigner, Ben Wikler, put it: “If you ask people what Hillary Clinton’s platform was, they couldn’t tell you … If you asked people what Donald Trump’s platform was, everyone could tell you.”A Democratic campaign founded on economic populism could have defeated Trump, but Clinton did not believe in it, and was beholden to vested economic interests who would have suffered because of it.A leftwing insurgency is undoubtedly making inroads against the Democratic party establishment. The triumph of a 28-year-old socialist, Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez – who defeated a party establishment kingpin, Joe Crowley, in a New York primary – was one striking example, and self-declared socialists have won from Virginia to Pennsylvania. New movements such as the Justice Democrats and Our Revolution are helping to catapult progressive candidates into elected office. But prominent campaigners tell me that the Democratic party establishment see the left as a mortal threat: that their desire is for a 2020 presidential candidate with perceived superior personal and moral traits to those of Trump, – someone charming and with supposed integrity, rather than someone who offers a genuine radical political alternative. If they succeed, no lessons will have been learned from 2016, and a Trump re-election beckons – meaning we are not even a quarter of the way through his presidency.Here in Britain, the manner in which the official leave campaign conducted itself in the EU referendum legitimised the xenophobic right. The Tory hard right is in the ascendancy, and a fascist street movement – led by convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson – represents a growing threat. What could be described as a Far-Right International is developing: Trump’s Mussolini-praising former strategist Steve Bannon tours Europe meeting politicians including Tory hard Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, while wealthy “alt right” extremists in the US are set to plough financial resources into the resurgent British far right.Unlike the US, the left has assumed the leadership of the Labour party. In 2015, Labour was heading for political oblivion, suffering one of its worst postwar defeats and splintering in three different directions: to the civic nationalists of the SNP, the xenophobic right of Ukip, and the more radical Green party. Corbynism could not secure victory for Labour within two years of this rout, but saved the party from going the way of the German Social Democrats and the French Socialists.And yet. Chatter abounds of either a national government – floated openly by Tory remainers, privately by a small grouping of Labour MPs – or a new “centrist” party. If I was a hard-right strategist, I would be aching for either option. The former would mean a stitch-up of politicians to form a government no one voted for, united around reversing a referendum result: vindication of the right’s narrative of betrayal.For the politics of a new “centrist” party, look no further than Anna Soubry: a Tory politician who has not only mostly voted with her party on Brexit, but has voted for the bedroom tax, cuts to disability and low-paid benefits, slashing taxes on the rich and big business, hiking VAT, hammering trade unions, and privatising the NHS and Royal Mail. That would be the politics of a new centrist party: combining social liberalism with policies that favour the rich at the expense of workers and the vulnerable. At its most successful it would simply ide the anti-Tory vote, handing power to a Conservative party de facto led – as Soubry herself says – by Jacob Rees-Mogg.There has been a longstanding myth that political upheaval and crisis belonged to mainland Europe, that radical impulses were somehow alien to British or American political culture. Both nations are now in turmoil because the neoliberal project promised freedom and instead delivered insecurity. Disappearing jobs, creaking public services, a lack of affordable housing: all have led to a widespread desire for a rupture with the old order. The radical right is feeding from this disillusion. Only a left that offers a genuine alternative – to hold powerful vested interests to account, rather than scapegoating migrants and Muslims – can hope to defeat this political poison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bbc7599908289f8b3a5d145974e3ec946bbb45/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=196ed450feaec17a7ee790d8c94f3a30","title":"the dark knight at 10 how christopher nolan reshaped superhero cinema","story":"The legacy of 2008’s dark Batman sequel has been clouded by a string of dour DC missteps and a wider misunderstanding of the film’s groundbreaking grimness Can Christopher Nolan predict the future? Could he have somehow foreseen the eerily specific prescience of Batman’s introduction in 2008’s The Dark Knight, modern superhero cinema’s unwitting blueprint? Christian Bale’s caped crusader doesn’t show his cowled face until a few scenes into the film, after the Joker has pulled off his daring bank heist. Bruce Wayne arrives on the scene to bust up a powwow between some mobsters and guest villain Scarecrow, but he’s preceded by some paunchy copycats armed with shotguns and hockey pads. Their effort to emulate Batman only gets them into trouble, until the genuine article shows up to dispatch the goons with minimal difficulty. Purrs the Scarecrow: “That’s more like it.”The dour, oppressively grey DC Cinematic Universe is likewise littered with cinematic imitators of Nolan’s vision, having learned all the wrong lessons from Batman’s example. Led by chief architect Zack Snyder, the DC Comics adaptations fell in line behind the gargantuan box office success of Nolan’s films by aping his tone in the hopes that that would be sufficient to recreate the magic. And while box office grosses have for the most part remained healthy, the quality of the films themselves has never come close to matching the rigorous precision, popcorn philosophizing, and sheer cinematic verve of the film now celebrating its tenth anniversary. “We’re going to do this forever, aren’t we?” taunts the Joker, near the tail end of The Dark Knight. Little did he know their psychotic pas de deux would be rehashed over and over again.Bolstered by an ambitious script from Nolan, his brother (and, elsewhere, Westworld co-creator) Jonathan, and regular DC Comics scribe David Goyer, The Dark Knight ushered in an age of po-faced seriousness – a look that takes a lot of gravitas to pull off. Breaking from a more sprightly, brightly-colored tradition of comic book films best exemplified by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man pictures, Nolan nudged the genre in the direction of hard realism. Bale’s Batman doesn’t behave like a valiant defender of the defenseless, rather like a hard-nosed cop unencumbered by legal codes of conduct. The Joker, a role that enshrined Heath Ledger in myth following his untimely passing, is no mere super villain, either. He’s an ideological deviant, referred to at least once in the script directly as a “terrorist”, compelled only by the love of violence and chaos. His agenda is chilling in its indifference he gleefully sets a mountain of money ablaze in full view of the crooks he took it from, just to show them that this is a war fought on principle. He’s the closest thing to nuance that the DC rogues’ gallery has ever seen, and characteristic of a film founded in social theory. The Joker’s grand evil scheme? Sociology thought experiments … made real!With Wonder Woman as the emboldened, upbeat exception along with the wisecracking Flash (Ezra Miller, livening up Justice League every time he appeared onscreen), the recent efforts from the DC camp simply slather on the somberness. They mistake world-weariness for outright pessimism, and aspire to nothing more profound than that most overused of registers: “gritty”. The DC canon has more grit than a sandpaper factory, full of grimacing heroes who would fly into the sun before they allowed themselves to crack a smile. They consider wielding power to be a great and terrible burden, just like Batman, but unlike the brutal vigilante protecting a town that nonetheless loathes him, they’re not supported with the motivation for that jaded viewpoint.More troubling still, DC’s works form the vanguard of a much wider movement towards the homogeneously dark. To varying levels of success, there’s been a mass gritification through Hollywood, affecting everyone from Robin Hood to Universal’s cabal of monster-movie spooks. The Dark Knight’s excellence has been all but boiled down to the single, caveman-simplistic notion that bummer equals mature. Constant flops along the lines of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword have proven otherwise, but this is apparently a lesson that must be learned many times over.While it’s no fair to hold its unruly offspring against The Dark Knight, it’s all the same frustrating that the rich backlog of comic book arcana from the DC catalogue has never been mined with the same thoughtfulness and technical ingenuity. To paraphrase the film’s pensive final monologue: we’ve been given the releases that DC’s bottom line needs, but not the ones that Batman’s memory deserves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc85162250c0a35d1559d3100e26376fcc1051b6/652_631_3767_2261/master/3767.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d24e98071ff69ef1cfc70350ae2f42f","title":"thomas friends big world big adventures the movie review peter andre","story":"There’s new rolling stock on the tracks as Thomas the Tank Engine learns more life lessons, but gender stereotypes remainFor years it was the kids’ programme liberal parents loved to hate – all those male trains burning fossil fuel in that little corner of Ukip paradise, the Isle of Sodor.

The whole thing has a straight-to-DVD quality, or perhaps a TV episode padded out with a few limp songs. (“I’m free and easy, lemon squeezy, never saying pretty-please-y”.)Once again that noted shirker Thomas is learning life lessons about friendship and keeping your promises, this time getting his wheels burned by a toxic friendship with a devil-may-care Australian racing car, Ace (voiced by Peter Andre). Suffering a serious case of engine envy, Thomas abandons his responsibilities at the station to tag along with Ace on a round-the-world race. First stop is Dakar and then it’s over to the Amazon rainforest (miraculously unspoilt by climate change). Inevitably, reckless Ace leaves Thomas high and dry, while Nia, a female engine from Kenya, turns out to be a better friend – despite Thomas huffily attempting to ditch her at every available opportunity.The overhaul here seems sincere if a little strained, and the franchise deserves some points for unshackling Thomas from the yesteryear universe of creator the Rev Wilbert Awdry, a vicar and railway enthusiast. But the lazy gender stereotypes need to go. Predictably, the super-cool, risk-taking racing car is male while the role of the female engine is to be virtuous and peace-making.

This impressive-looking tart is a lighter, simpler take on the classic French pastry, and is designed to let the fruit shine.For the pastry110g cold butter200g plain flour65g caster sugar¼ tsp fine saltFor the filling200ml whipping cream2 tsp icing sugar½-2 tsp rosewater, to taste (optional)200g thick whole-milk yoghurtAbout 500g ripe strawberries4 tbsp redcurrant jelly, or other smooth jam (optional)You could use 375g ready-made sweet shortcrust here, but this is so easy, it’s very little extra effort than shop-bought. Dice the butter and put it in a food processor with the flour, sugar and salt, and pulse for about a minute, until the mix resembles damp sand. Alternatively, put everything in a bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips.Tip the pastry crumbs into a loose-bottomed, shallow, 25cm tart tin, then spread out to cover the base and bank them up around the sides. Press the crumbs with the base of a glass, until you have a solid pastry case, working the crumbs up the edges as well, so the whole tin is evenly coated. Pop it into the freezer and chill for 15 minutes, until firm.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Take the tin out of the freezer, prick the base all over with a fork, then bake for about 20-25 minutes, until crisp and lightly golden all over. Keep an eye on it towards the end of the cooking time, because overcooked pastry tends to crumble once filled.Leave the baked shell to cool completely in the tin, then transfer to a serving plate. If you try to rush this bit and fill the case while it’s still warm, the pastry is liable to go soggy. You may, however, make the pastry case a few hours in advance, in which case keep it in its tin and, once cool, cover with a tea towel.Pour the cream into a large bowl and whip until it’s just starting to hold its shape. Sift in the sugar (this will get rid of any lumps) and add half a teaspoon of rosewater, if using. Different brands vary hugely in strength, so start small: you can always add more later. (For other flavouring ideas, see step 9.)Keep whipping the cream until it forms soft peaks, then fold in the yoghurt. You could use cream alone, but yoghurt gives the tart a lighter, fresher flavour – don’t be tempted to use a reduced-fat variety, though, because that will make it sour and watery. Greek yoghurt, being thicker, may need to be whisked briefly beforehand, to make it easier to incorporate.Taste the cream mix and add more rosewater or sugar, if need be, then spoon into the tart case and smooth out with a spoon or spatula. Wash the strawberries, then hull and cut into quarters (or sixths, if they are on the large side). Arrange neatly on top of the cream, starting in the centre, points facing upwards, in concentric circles or just cut the fruit in half and lay cut side down in neat rows.If you’re happy with a more natural look, you can now serve the tart just as it is.

No charges were ever brought, and in response Richard spent millions of pounds fighting the broadcaster, successfully arguing that the BBC’s right to report the facts of an ongoing investigation did not outweigh his right to privacy.But while the singer’s story drew inidual sympathy, there was some alarm among media experts at the wider consequences that the ruling could bring with it. Lawyer David Malone of Red Lion Chambers, who specialises in cases involving serious sexual offences, said media coverage of alleged abusers often encouraged other victims to come forward.“It is important that, in appropriate cases in the future, the police are not cowed by this judgment, and do still at the very least consider reporting the name of an inidual, when that action may enable other victims to come forward to strengthen the case against that inidual,” said Malone, who urged police forces to provide the media with the names of iniduals suspected of serious sexual offences.The judge in the case concluded that “a suspect has a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to a police investigation”, raising concerns among many lawyers and news outlets that the British media tradition of being able to factually report the details of pre-charge investigations was under the threat.Malone said the case has “potentially huge, and perhaps constitutional, implications” for cases involving historic child abuse, especially by those in positions of power and influence. But he insisted the judgment still made it clear that there was a clear public interest to naming suspects since many witnesses often only come forward when another person has already “put their head above the parapet” – such as in the case of paedophile BBC presenter Stuat Hall – providing police and the media could justify their actions.However, other lawyers and editors suggested the ruling would effectively shut down press coverage of those under investigation in all but the most extreme of cases, for fear of being sued for breach of privacy.British contempt laws already ban media outlets from publishing material information that might seriously prejudice active legal proceedings, effectively meaning news coverage is muted from the moment that an inidual is charged. If pre-charge coverage is also restricted then reporting major cases could be effectively limited to official statements from the police and court proceedings, until the point at which a trial concluded and a verdict is delivered.Ian Murray of the Society of Editors insisted that “such a major change in the law should be debated in parliament and not come into force following one case involving a high-profile celebrity”, while Tony Gallagher, the editor of the Sun, warned that “suspects will assert privacy rights” in a bid to stop coverage.Iniduals involved in law enforcement said the case made it clear that reporting restrictions should be tighter. Dame Vera Baird QC, of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said the case provided extra clarity that the police should not publicise the name those arrested or suspected of a crime, except in “exceptional circumstances where there is a legitimate policing purpose to do so”.The judge acknowledged concerns that his judgment “capable of having a significant impact on press reporting” but insisted he was not changing the law, merely applying the right to privacy which already existed. He said: “If the position of the press is now different from that which it has been in the past, that is because of the Human Rights Act, and not because of some court-created principle.”One man happy with the new precedent is Richard himself, who said he spent £4m on the case so others would not have their names made public before charges are brought and said he’d “rather 10 guilty people get away with it than one innocent person suffer”.“I just hope the press don’t think the freedom of speech is in danger here,” he said in an interview with ITV News. “It’s not. It’s their abuse of it that’s in danger. That’s what I’ll always fight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f22fa3e4a3a994275ab19aa471bac5cf61897457/0_0_5418_3666/master/5418.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f8b8888f1665392acc0a9af61e02aad5 1400w","title":"senior tory criticises may over brexit saying jacob rees mogg is running our country politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and May’s evidence to the Commons liaison committeeWe’re closing down this live blog soon, so here’s a summary of the most recents events:Over August and September we are going to be releasing a number of technical notifications to set out what UK citizens and businesses need to do in a no deal scenario, so making much more public awareness of the preparations. We imagine there are going to be around 70 of those technical notices that will be issued.My colleague, Heather Stewart, has been looking at Boris Johnson’s Commons speech. Here, she explains what said and what he meant:The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has said his government will have to “change gear” in how it deals with Brexit.The nation’s cabinet has been discussing ways to step up preparations for a hard Brexit on Wednesday. Its government is also planning to hire 1,000 custom officers and veterinary inspectors at its ports and airports. Varadkar said that, with Brexit eight months away, growing uncertainty loomed over whether it would be possible to get a withdrawal agreement through Westminster.We need to change the gear and up our preparations in dealing with Brexit.In a dramatic intervention, the Conservative MP, Simon Clarke, stood up and declared he was withdrawing his letter of no confidence in the prime minister and said others should give her their backing.Afterwards, Clarke told reporters he had put in his letter last Tuesday following the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis as foreign and Brexit secretaries, respectively. But Clarke said he had since had second thoughts.We have got a mission in government and it is serious. God knows, the threat of a Corbyn government is real.May had stressed the risks of an election and a Labour administration, he said, adding:We’ve looked into the abyss in the last few days. We’ve really been through the mill. We should just not do this.One MP said the scene was “electric” when Clarke withdrew his letter, saying they had “never seen anything like that in all my years at the 22”. Clarke said the prime minister was impassive as he did so.That’s the prime minister, she doesn’t buckle under pressure and she doesn’t revel in the good times. There was no big smile.I think we’ve all witnessed her under attack by both sides, both Andrea Jenkyns at PMQs and by Anna Soubry yesterday, and the vast majority of us are in the middle and don’t want to see chaos.Steve Baker, who resigned as a Brexit minister last week over the prime minister’s Chequers deal, has a further warning for Theresa May. He suggested the number of his Tory colleagues willing to vote down any deal that is “too soft” is substantially more than 40. The number required to trigger a leadership challenge is 48.A number of 40 has been bandied around in this House in the last few days – I’m sorry to say, it gives me no pleasure to say it, but the thing I have to say is ‘and the rest’.The people who have said the number 40 are not out by a fraction when they come to consider the number of members who don’t like this deal on these benches and are willing to vote in line with that dislike, they are out by a factor.People must face up to the difficult truth that a Brexit which requires a high degree of permanent alignment to the European Union will not go through this House of Commons. It will fail.Others apparently believe the magic number will be reached soon:Yesterday, senior Conservatives was trying to portray the choice facing rebellious Tory MPs as being between backing Theresa May and backing Jeremy Corbyn, whom party whips were claiming would be the main beneficiary of a Commons defeat for the government over Brexit.The Brexit-supporting MP, Iain Duncan Smith, is echoing that language as he leaves the meeting:Simon Clarke, the Tory MP who withdrew his letter of no confidence this afternoon, is making clear that May’s government is not out of the woods yet. This from Business Insider’s UK political editor, Adam Bienkov:We’re getting some news now on how the 1922 committee meeting went for the prime minister: Relatively well, it seems.These from Sky News’ senior political correspondent, Jason Farrell, and the Sun’s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn:And this conciliatory message from the regular thorn in May’s side, Jacob Rees-Mogg, via the ’s own Pippa Crerar:Over August and September we are going to be releasing a number of technical notifications to set out what UK citizens and businesses need to do in a no deal scenario, so making much more public awareness of the preparations. We imagine there are going to be around 70 of those technical notices that will be issued.That’s all from me for today.Theresa May spoke to reporters on her way into the Conservative 1922 committee meeting. She confirmed that she had not seen Boris Johnson’s speech. And, as the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn reports, she said that watching it later would not be a priority.As my colleague Pippa Crerar reports, she also told journalists they needed a break.In his speech Boris Johnson claimed the pound “soared” after Theresa May’s Lancaster House speech.But, as the Press Association’s Ian Jones says, it didn’t.At the liaison committee Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, is now asking about defence.In an unusual (and welcome) move, the committee has provided a visual aid. It has posted this graph (pdf) on its website showing how defence spending has more than halved since the 1950s as a proportion of GDP.Lewis asks May to accept that the UK has always outspent its European Nato allies. Shouldn’t the UK continue to do so?May says the UK is spending more than EU partners.Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s story about Boris Johnson’s speech."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ba01df43594372070ab0111e161039ae7b5006/774_719_4024_2415/master/4024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3715e3958dc4112476a27db3884667d3","title":"what is your earliest childhood memory and did it really happen","story":"A new study suggests that many first memories are actually fictional and based on photographs and family stories.

For some, it is their first bee sting or a formative interaction with a parent as a toddler. Others claim to be able to recall lying in a pram. But how sure are you that you have actually remembered this experience, rather than it being informed by photographs and family anecdotes?Professor Martin Conway, director of the Centre for Memory and Law at City, University of London, and co-author of the research, explained what fuels such fictional first memories: “When we looked through the responses from participants, we found that a lot of these first ‘memories’ were frequently related to infancy, and a typical example would be a memory based around a pram. For this person, this type of memory could have resulted from someone saying something like ‘mother had a large green pram’. The person then imagines what it would have looked like. Over time these fragments then become a memory and often the person will start to add things in such as a string of toys along the top.” We are interested to hear what you believe to be your earliest memory.

In a fulminating finale to the first ski station finish of the Tour de France this year, Team Sky crushed their rivals and gave themselves two solid options on overall victory in Paris on 29 July.In pole position is Geraint Thomas, 1min\u0026nbsp25sec ahead of the champion, Chris Froome. With so many other teams failing to match their team’s collective strength the chances of Sky faltering look slim.Thomas took the yellow jersey after hammering home the team’s striking advantage he looks good in yellow but he also seems to know his place. The mantra at Sky is that Froome is No\u0026nbsp1, that he has won six Grand Tours and that Thomas is happy just to have his moment in the sun.But the Welshman is no slouch, no one-day wonder. He has won Paris‑Nice, the Critérium du Dauphiné and Olympic and Commonwealth gold. His apprenticeship has been hard-fought and long enough for him to know that, now he is in his thirties, this may be his best chance in the Tour.“I’m just going to enjoy being in yellow in the Tour de France,” Thomas\u0026nbspinsisted, “even if it’s just for a day it’ll be great. I’d love to keep it for a few days but we’ll see tomorrow how it goes.”Asked if he would take his chance to win the Tour, even at Froome’s expense, if the moment came, Thomas demurred. “Some guys might sit here and give some PR bullshit but I just say how it is with me and that’s how it is. Froomey is the leader.“I’m not going to sit up and lose time, but I think we’re in a great position. It’s just a bit of an unknown for me to race over three weeks. It’s the ideal scenario at the moment and long may it continue.”Yet even the best of friends can see ambition ruin their relationship. While the Wiggins-Froome feud of 2012 was briefly reprised this week – when Sir Bradley Wiggins suggested the Team Sky principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, was “isive” and “self-serving” – a better comparison is perhaps with the all‑star La Vie Claire team of 1986 which imploded as the American Greg Lemond crossed swords with his ageing mentor, Bernard Hinault.While Sky pondered how best to ide the spoils of their success they left a trail of broken ambitions scattered across the mountainsides.Only Tom Dumoulin, runner-up to Froome in this year’s Giro d’Italia, is within two minutes of the team’s British pairing. Only Vincenzo Nibali, Primoz Riglic, Steven Kruijswijk, Mikel Landa and Nairo Quintana are within three.For Quintana’s Movistar team it proved a make-or-break stage. The Colombian’s Spanish teammate Alejandro Valverde launched an ambitious attack 55km from the finish but wilted on the final climb. That may have been the platform for Quintana or co-leader Landa to go clear, but under the pressure of Sky’s high‑tempo riding both were found wanting.Further behind, Rigoberto Uran, second overall last year to Froome, appeared listless and lost, struggling with knee injuries sustained in the cobbled stage to Roubaix. The Colombian is now more than half an hour behind Thomas and his team will revert to hunting for stage wins.At the back of the peloton, the scene was even more torrid, with Mark Cavendish left to fend for himself after his teammates were forced to leave him on the first steep climb, the Montée de Bisanne. His Tour, like that of rival sprinter Marcel Kittel, is over after he finished 65 minutes behind Thomas and far outside the time limit.“We were hoping that he would get through today and tomorrow so that he could focus on Friday,” Ryder added, referring to the next likely sprint finish. “We thought Cav would get better but I guess the lack of racing over the last two years has affected his power to get through tough tours.”King of the Mountains:\u0026nbsp1 J Alaphilippe (Fr) Quick-Step Floors 61pts 2 S Pauwels (Bel) Dimension Data 49 3 W Barguil (Fr) Fortuneo-Samsic 40"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8523949ad20fae868cfdd1cdf98887f270aed7/0_172_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5c474c888e79a05c252b50f449e821b","title":"make your own history with a tour of irelands ancient east","story":"For a road trip less ordinary, sail across the Irish Sea to experience the finest medieval castles, prehistoric stone circles and culinary hotspots the Emerald Isle has to offer. By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

Last year, the  reported on internal Facebook moderation documents which suggested that the company flouted Holocaust denial laws except in countries where it was likely to be sued or prosecuted. Zuckerberg, who has also come under fire for Facebook’s role in election interference efforts and the company’s misuse of personal data, reiterated his commitment to allowing abhorrent content on the platform in the latest interview. He said Holocaust deniers were “deeply offensive”, but “I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong … It’s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly.”Zuckerberg said offensive speech can cross a line and face removal when it is harassing or endangering people: “We are moving towards the policy of misinformation that is aimed at or going to induce violence, we are going to take down … If it’s going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you’re attacking iniduals, then that content shouldn’t be on the platform.” Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have faced intense scrutiny for allowing far-right commentator Alex Jones to continue to host his Infowars site, which most infamously has spread false claim that the Sandy Hook mass shooting that killed 20 school children was a hoax. That content, Zuckerberg said, would be removed if it was abusive towards an inidual: “Going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, ‘Hey, no, you’re a liar’ – that is harassment, and we actually will take that down.”Zuckerberg also faced repeated questions about his feelings on Facebook’s influence in Myanmar, where hate speech has exploded on the platform, with some linking killings to content on the site. He did not answer directly, but said, “People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.”On Wednesday, Facebook told reporters at its Menlo Park headquarters that it would be taking down misinformation used to provoke physical harm, rather than just de-ranking it in the news feed.The announcement was spurred by outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence in Sri Lanka. One of the triggers for the violence was posts spreading misinformation about the Muslim community. The situation escalated to the point that the Sri Lankan government temporarily blocked Facebook’s services in March after misinformation inciting violence remained online for days after they were reported.The company said it was working with civil society groups to better understand how misinformation spurs local tensions but that it had yet to draw up clear criteria for what constitutes violence, and which other countries apart from Sri Lanka would be the initial focus of the policy. “At the moment we are starting the work in countries where we’ve recently seen instances where misinformation has been perceived to contribute to physical violence offline,” explained Facebook’s Tessa Lyons.The policy would eventually be implemented globally, the company said. In his interview, Zuckerberg was also asked about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which the  first reported in 2015. In March, the Observer and the  revealed that millions of Americans’ personal data was harvested from the site through an app and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy. In the interview, the CEO noted that the  had “initially pointed” this out to Facebook, saying: “And when we learned about that, we immediately shut down the app, took away his profile, and demanded certification that the data was deleted.”It’s unclear what Zuckerberg meant by “immediately”, given that Facebook only suspended the firm and the Cambridge university researcher who harvested data in March of 2018, despite the ’s reporting several years prior. Facebook did not immediately respond to questions about Zuckerberg’s comments on Holocaust deniers and Cambridge Analytica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a5d7a2706b7dedf871cfc4c667b3e42c11ec94/0_0_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812776753a6b4bea412a60ca508f0fe3","title":"adobe and the search for the lost fonts of the bauhaus","story":"The quest to track down long-forgotten typographical gems from the troves of the renowned German design institutionIn the esoteric world of typography, legendary designer Erik Spiekermann is the equivalent of Indiana Jones. He doesn’t wear a battered fedora or carry a whip. He has never raced through the desert on camels in a quest for the holy grail, or fought his way out of buried Egyptian tombs on the trail of the lost ark. But to graphic designers, animators, typographers and font aficionados he has done something far more impressive: he brought hidden fonts back to life and, with the help of an international group of design students, has, in his own words, “liberated them from the drawing board”.These are no ordinary fonts, either, but fonts created by students of the Bauhaus. Founded in 1919 and shut down by the Nazis for its political and aesthetic radicalism in 1933, the Bauhaus had an inestimable impact on the art and architecture of the 20th century, and its approach to typography continues to inspire designers to this day.“Bauhaus is the most famous design school and every design student knows about it,” says Rufus Deuchler, principal manager of Creative Cloud evangelism at software company Adobe. “Adobe’s Hidden Treasures concept is all about bringing back to life pieces of art from the past, and we came up with the idea of tracking down the lost fonts of Bauhaus.”Adobe has form when it comes to bringing art treasures back to life it enabled designers and artists to paint with digitally recreated versions of the brushes of celebrated artist Edvard Munch when it launched its Hidden Treasures concept last year.As part of the project, digital artists around the world submitted their version of The Scream, Munch’s most famous work the winner got to see their work hanging next to the original painting in the Munch Museum in Oslo.Reviving the fonts of the Bauhaus was a very different task. First of all, Spiekermann had to track down the original fonts themselves, which meant trawling through the archives at the Bauhaus school in Dessau – one of the three original Bauhaus school buildings – which stored everything when the school was abruptly shut down.With help from Adobe and Bauhaus, Spiekermann discovered hundreds of artworks, posters, sketches and student exercises that had been kept flat in drawers and art portfolios for nearly 100 years. Some were just fragments, while others were more complete works, but working with a group of international design students, the typographer was able to select five different font designs and set about bringing them back to life. Just being in the presence of original Bauhaus work was incredibly moving, says Spiekermann. “The minute the work is unwrapped, you’re back to 90 years ago and in the presence of the students themselves,” he says. “The rooms were stark – black and white with a little bit of colour every now and then – but they were also airy, with lots of light, so they were geometric in a very liberating, pleasant way, and there was a kind of joyful starkness about the building.“You can imagine these guys in their 20s sweating over their creations, sketching away while a strict professor told them to draw straight lines and not to smudge their work,” he says. “It was a physical and emotional joy for us, as we could not only look at their work but smell and touch it too. It’s like seeing the Mona Lisa for the first time: you have seen it in books and countless reproductions, but all of a sudden you think: ‘Oh my god, this is different.’ It was magic.”Rather than the perfect digital images we are used to, Spiekermann loved seeing the imperfections of the work. “They used glue and pencil and all the things we don’t use any more,” he says. “Everything nowadays is virtual, which can also mean that it doesn’t exist. But this is atoms, not pixels, and close up you can see the imperfections in the work because it’s all hand-drawn.”The original Bauhaus typefaces were created mainly for a specific poster or an exercise in class, meaning that the students didn’t design the whole font. However, out of the fragments of the artworks, Spiekermann and his students created whole alphabets.“They really surprised us with their passion for these fonts,” says Deuchler. “Creating a font is an incredibly complex process, which takes not only hard work and discipline but knowledge. It’s not just a matter of drawing a letter – A, B, C and so on. It’s about the understanding of how an alphabet works.”With the first two lost Bauhaus fonts already being available for download through Adobe – three more will follow in the coming months – the next generation of artists have wasted no time in getting to grips with the new type. “We are already seeing a whole lot of engagement from designers all over the world using those fonts, which is really exciting to see,” says Deuchler. Launched at the recent three-day Adobe Live event, the fonts have received a “very positive reaction” from designers, says Deuchler.“What I find really interesting is that for the younger generation, who don’t necessarily know about the Bauhaus, there’s this whole opportunity to learn history. It’s like opening a history book and seeing how modern and relevant these things are – it’s a teachable moment.” To mark the launch of The Lost Alphabets of Bauhaus, Adobe has launched a series of five challenges encouraging creatives to use these fonts for the very first time and win prizes, including an all-expenses-paid trip to Dessau, Germany to visit the Bauhaus archives.

How can we ensure new tools such as big data and artificial intelligence are a force for good?Wherever humans go, we leave little trails of data behind us. There are the digital bits – Facebook profiles, mailing lists, search histories – and there is the treasure trove our bodies can produce. Smart watches can pick up changes in skin conductivity that indicate how stressed you are, and sleep trackers can monitor how much you’re moving at night, to determine whether you’ve had the recommended eight hours’ kip. And, increasingly, we’re seeing wearables move out of the home and into the workplace.In 2015, BP in North America distributed 24,500 fitness trackers to employees and their partners, and offered staff money off their health insurance if they met their exercise goals. Other companies, including the Bank of America, Kimberly-Clark, Time Warner and Target are also offering their employees similar trackers.But workplace wearables are about much more than fitness alone. At a factory in Hangzhou, China, employees have been given helmets with embedded sensors that allegedly monitor brainwaves and can detect when employees are feeling angry or depressed. In Amsterdam, financial traders experimented with a bracelet that measures emotions through electrodermal activity, using light patterns and colours to indicate when they are in a heightened emotional state. The idea is that if people are more aware of their feelings, they are more likely to rethink their decisions and less likely to act recklessly.But how do we, as humans, feel about all this data gathering? “For a long time, people looked at wearables as if they might be a big brother-type scenario, to do with surveillance within the organisation,” says Chris Brauer, director of innovation at the Institute of Management Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London. “But now they’re viewed more as an opportunity to gather evidence to substantiate things that are going on in the workplace.”There’s also the argument that cold data can provide an unbiased picture of how people are feeling and why they might be acting in a certain way. “If an employee is really stressed, they’re unlikely to report that to their employers for fear that it’ll be seen as a projection of weakness,” says Brauer. “What wearables do is provide evidence-based data that’s accurate and therefore indicative of what’s going on.”However, there are fears that companies might use wearables to keep tabs on employees. In January, Amazon was granted a patent on a wristband that could pinpoint the location of warehouse employees and buzz if they were about to place an item in the wrong section. The online retailer has also used tracking technology to make sure its warehouse employees don’t fall below a certain level of productivity.It’s not just warehouse employees who are subjected to digital surveillance – there is a whole industry that produces software to keep an eye on office workers. There are programmes that track keystrokes and cross-reference those against screenshots automatically grabbed from employees’ screens to make sure they’re working. In January 2016, the Daily  removed sensors it had installed that used heat and motion detection to monitor whether people were at their desks.In other professions, however, keeping track of employees can be a matter of life or death. Australian company Seeing Machines develops computer vision systems that can recognise when a driver is distracted or about to fall asleep at the wheel. Currently, the eye-tracking system is used to detect the fatigue levels of truck drivers, pilots, train drivers and people who operate heavy machinery.Even though wellness regimes might add to company productivity in the long run, Murden says it’s important that companies don’t run staff ragged. “We’re not just computers, you can’t just switch us on and expect us to keep going and going,” she says. “But when you support a team properly and they’re working to their absolute optimum, that’s when they’ll flourish.”For Murden, bringing a workforce up to its full potential can involve a broad range of approaches. Sometimes Push Mind and Body prescribes Beyoncé dance classes, or sets up workshops that help people learn how to use stress to their advantage. Murden also teaches employees how to prep their meals for the working week, or recommends one-on-one psychotherapy sessions.Part of the problem with the modern workplace is that it can be difficult for people to manage their workloads, says Chintan Patel, chief technologist at Cisco UK and Ireland. For all the benefits they bring, the ubiquity of smartphones and laptops means that the line between work and home is more blurred than ever before. “If I can access something from my mobile device, does that mean I’m contactable 24 hours a day and need to be responding all the time?” he asks.But instead of turning us into drones, there is the possibility that technology could eventually help to make us feel a little more human at work. Brauer says that it might not be such a bad thing if the most repetitive parts of our jobs do become automated, because this would free up our time and energy to do things that humans are really good at.Some artificial intelligence (AI) systems can already detect from a photograph whether a mole or freckle is cancerous faster than dermatologists. This could be good news for doctors and patients, Brauer says. “They can reinvest that time in professional development, research, or spending more time with their families or patients.”“The technology that’s coming is offering us rehumanising potential,” Brauer says, as long as companies use it as an opportunity to retrain their employees and increase their skills, rather than letting it displace human workers altogether. Patel agrees. With Cisco he’s already thinking about how he can use AI to replace the most repetitive parts of his employees’ days and give them more time to get on with work that excites them, or to concentrate on self-development.We’re already seeing AI tools start to trickle into the mainstream. Smart compose features, which cut down on the need for repetitive typing within emails, are becoming a reality. Virtual personal assistants are becoming more useful – and less of a novelty – with every update. Recently, Google even showcased its assistant booking a hair appointment over the phone.The internet giant reckons voice assistants will soon go the way of wearables and make the shift from being a device we’re used to using in our homes, to one that is commonplace in the office too.As long as this technology is used to empower rather than oppress workers, Brauer is optimistic about the future of the workplace. In the not-too-distant future, many of us will be part of augmented workforces in which people work alongside machines and AI systems that help achieve more with our time, while allowing us to break free from the most mind-numbing parts of our jobs. Technology, it seems, might be just what we need to stop us turning into robots after all.Click here to discover how Cisco can help your SME growIllustration by Bewilder.tv for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d89968f3f82d0f79ce07294fd77e71a7ed93a2f/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc588a34a06000ac3c669214b6335c8","title":"turkeys state of emergency ends but crackdown continues","story":"Laws enacted after 2016 coup attempt are lifted but ‘climate of fear’ remains, say criticsTurkey’s two-year state of emergency was set to come to an end at midnight on Wednesday, but as trials of dissidents and journalists continue human rights campaigners have said Ankara must do more to reverse a “suffocating” crackdown on free speech.Critics say the state of emergency, in place since a failed coup attempt in July 2016 that killed 250 people and wounded 1,400, has been used to detain opponents of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his government for lengthy periods without trial and to intimidate dissidents and prosecute media outlets. More than 120,000 people in the police, military, academia, media and civil service have been detained or dismissed from their jobs over their alleged links to Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in the US whose supporters Ankara blames for the coup. “Over the last two years, Turkey has been radically transformed with emergency measures used to consolidate draconian powers, silence critical voices and strip away basic rights,” said Fotis Filippou, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Europe. “The lifting of the state of emergency alone will not reverse this crackdown. What is needed is systematic action to restore respect for human rights, allow civil society to flourish again and lift the suffocating climate of fear that has engulfed the country.”Turkey’s government has said it will not seek a renewal of the state of emergency, allowing it to lapse two years after it was imposed and days after Erdoğan was sworn in as president for a fresh five-year term with extraordinary new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Critics say the use of the emergency powers went beyond Gülenists linked to the coup. About a quarter of Turkey’s judges have either been dismissed or detained, a vast realignment of the judiciary that has prompted outrage and concerns that it is no longer independent.Thousands have been tried, with many sentenced to life, for involvement in the coup and 100 people have been extradited to Turkey at the behest of the country’s intelligence service, the MİT. The crackdown has also increased tensions with western allies such as the EU and the US. On Wednesday a court in the city of İzmir ruled for the continued detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor accused of having Gülenist links, in a move that could prompt congressional sanction and that was described by an official at the US Commission on International Religious Freedom as a “mockery of justice”.Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) party has tabled a controversial anti-terrorism bill that will retain some of the state of emergency measures. One provision allows local governors to impose curfews or make some areas off-limits to the public, making it easier to ban demonstrations.The government also appears determined to continue its prosecutions of journalists and opponents.Turkey is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt, with more than 120 imprisoned since the coup attempt. Cumhuriyet journalists have been prosecuted in numerous court cases, with some, including the current editor-in-chief, appealing against convictions of up to seven-and-a-half years in jail. Erdoğan’s son-in-law and finance minister, Berat Albayrak, is also suing the journalists because of their reporting on offshore investments listed in the Paradise Papers, a move that the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders condemned as threatening the survival of independent media outlets reporting on corruption.“Independent media outlets are fewer now than the fingers on one hand,” said Ünker. “Journalism is our job so we have to do it in all conditions, even in the face of such duress and injustice.” But the crackdown appeared to have barely slowed even as the end of the state of emergency approached. A day before Erdoğan was sworn in, another 18,600 public servants were dismissed over alleged links to terror groups, and on Tuesday academics who had signed a petition calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Kurdish separatists were sentenced to prison. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the largest opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP), vowed in a party congress to challenge what he described as a “dictatorship” and one-man rule. But on Wednesday the government said it was launching an investigation against Kılıçdaroğlu for insulting the president, an allegation frequently used to intimidate critics, over a cartoon mocking the Turkish president that was shared on social media.The continued prosecutions offer a hint that, even though Erdoğan is secure in his control of the state’s levers of power and authority, there will be little immediate relief for dissidents.“I think state of emergency has served its purpose, both politically and practically,” said Selim Can Sazak, a Turkey expert and adjunct fellow at the Century Foundation. “The job is almost complete. Hundreds of thousands purged. Some Gülenists, apparently, but many others not. Universities, bureaucracy, media, etc, largely subdued.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"One-quarter of respondents satisfied with councils\u0026rsquo performance on affordable housingMarch from Famine Memorial marks centenary of South African leader\u0026rsquos birthParliamentary watchdog finds DUP North Antrim MP breached Westminister rulesTaoiseach says EU reassured him no physical checks needed on Border if no deal on BrexitNorthern Ireland Water lifts a national hosepipe ban that has been in place since JuneSinn F\u0026eacutein blames dissident repulican \u0026lsquoenemies of the people\u0026rsquo for Belfast incidentsTrade union says company is \u0026lsquodigging a hole for itself\u0026rsquo by allegedly failing to engage in wage talksSeven children identified with bug, two have been hospitalisedUndertakers confirm town\u0026rsquos public graveyards out of space for new burialsRNLI says men were in the water for \u0026lsquothree to four\u0026rsquo hours before they were rescuedFrances O\u0026rsquoDriscoll left with irreversible brain damage, High Court toldLow Pay Commission had recommended 25 cent increaseCourt hears Dr Declan Gill wore mask day after US presidential election \u0026lsquoas a joke\u0026rsquoNorthern Secretary\u0026rsquos commitment for Westminster to act in absence of StormontCourt hears Ross Thompson from Ballymun currently serving sentence for drug dealingMinister for Communications to hold talks with social network over \u0026lsquoDispatches\u0026rsquo expos\u0026eacuteChris Hanson pleaded guilty to assaulting \u0026lsquohigh-achieving\u0026rsquo Ennis womanJobless man driving new Mercedes withdraws claim after judge throws out wife\u0026rsquos casePieta House founder tells councillors she will develop volunteering initiative if elected"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3569461.1531943218!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"activists mark 100 years since birth of mandela","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of All Together in Dignity Ireland walk through the Famine Statues as part of a commemoration of 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. Photograph: Tom HonanA small group of activists marked the centenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth in a march from the Famine Memorial in Dublin city centre on Wednesday. Starting at the memorial by the IFSC, a group of 30 activists walked up the quays, stopping along the way to read out a selection of quotes from the deceased South African leader.Born in 1918, Mandela was an anti-apartheid revolutionary, who spent 27 years in prison, before becoming the first black president of South Africa in 1994. He was one of the most prominent political figures of the second half of the 20th century, and died in 2013. The commemoration was organised by human rights group All Together in Dignity (ATD) Ireland. Pierre Klein, national co-ordinator with ATD Ireland, said the legacy of Mandela was to be a “guide for the way we should develop a strong commitment against poverty”.In 1984, a Dunnes Stores worker in their Henry Street store refused to handle goods from South Africa, which led to a strike from several workers that only ended in 1987, when a ban was introduced on South African products by the Irish government. Speaking at the event, Imany Leyla Raye of NGO Front Line Defenders said Mandela “meant a lot” to her. Originally from Cameroon, she said “his struggle for freedom is very dear to us, especially those from African countries, because we see injustice . . . every day”.Former president of Ireland Mary Robinson wrote to the group organising the event, to express her support. “It is good that you are starting your march from the Famine Memorial ... in Dublin’s Docklands,” she wrote. “Our strong memory of an Gorta Mór, the Great Famine, and our struggles for freedom give Irish people a strong empathy for developing countries and communities. This was the focus of Nelson Mandela, who constantly called on rich countries to help poor countries,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing   July 16, 2018Airline says \u0026lsquosmall number\u0026rsquo of passengers treated as a precaution after the incident "},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3569402.1531939182!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit 1 000 new customs and veterinary inspectors to be hired","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaking at a special Cabinet meeting in Derrynane House, Co Kerry, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said  the British government will be expected to honour its ‘cast iron guarantee’ of the so-called backstop arrangement. Photograph: PAThe European Union has reassured the Government that no physical checks will be needed on the Border even if Britain crashes out of the union without a deal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar said that such a “doomsday scenario” would mean that the “commitments of others” would have to be relied upon to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. He indicated that this applies equally to the EU as it does to the UK.Speaking after a special Cabinet meeting in Derrynane House, Co Kerry, the Taoiseach said the British government will be expected to honour its “cast iron guarantee” of the so-called backstop arrangement.At the meeting, Ministers agreed to hire 700 additional customs officials to be deployed at ports and airports, and 300 extra staff to carry out checks on agricultural produce and animals travelling between Ireland and the UK after Brexit.A Government statement said “significant” investment will also be needed to upgrade existing infrastructure at ports and airports, in particular Rosslare and Dublin Ports .The Taoiseach said the Government is now stepping up its preparations for all Brexit eventualities.As well as the UK promise on the backstop, the Taoiseach also noted that senior EU figures, such as Jean Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, have also promised the Government that no physical infrastructure will be required.“Also President Juncker and my EU colleagues have on many occasions said that they wouldn’t require us to put in place a physical infrastructure and customs checks on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”Mr Varadkar also said he “profoundly” disagreed with comments made by former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who yesterday said Northern Ireland issues have dominated the debate on Brexit.“I am glad that Prime Minister May disagrees with him too,” Mr Varadkar said, noting Mrs May is visiting Northern Ireland this week. He also warned that the UK will be restricted in flying planes in European airspace in the event of a no deal Brexit.“The situation at the moment is that the United Kingdom is part of the single European sky, and if they leave the EU they are not and that does mean that if there was a no deal hard Brexit next March the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways and that is something that they need to think about.“You can not have your cake and eat it. You can’t take back your waters and then expect to use other people’s sky.”“In the unlikely event that we have a hard Brexit next March, with no deal, I think every country will struggle to put in place the necessary infrastructure and customs and veterinary officials in their ports and airports. It won’t be just us.”In such a scenario, the Taoiseach said, Irish measures that are planned to take two years, until the end of the post-Brexit transition phase, would have to be applied in a few months.He repeated that a withdrawal treaty, including the backstop, must be agreed for the UK to be given a transition deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins New legislation that will seek to prevent steep rises in rent paid for purpose-built student accommodation is to be introduced by the Government.Student accommodation prices in certain areas have seen increases of as much as 15 per cent, and there has been controversy over the high levels of rent paid in newly built student accommodation in Dublin and other cities.About 3,000 new “bedspaces” for students have been built in the last two years, with a further 7,000 currently under construction, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after a Cabinet meeting in Derrynane, Co Kerry, on Wednesday. Another 7,000 have been granted planning permission.Mary Mitchell O’Connor, the Minister of State for Higher Education, is to work on Government legislation over the summer. Student accommodation is not covered by the so-called rent pressure zones, which cap rent increases to four per cent per year in designated areas.This is because such accommodation is generally operated under licences and not as tenancies, as is the case with other rented properties.“The rent pressure zones applies to tenancies but doesn’t apply to most student accommodation because that operates under licence,” the Taoiseach said.Mr Varadkar acknowledged that the main Opposition parties had brought forward Dáil bills on the issue.“As is the case with any Opposition legislation, particularly when you are a minority government, you have to respond when they are raised by the Opposition,” he said.“And this is a real issue. This student accommodation is great, it is high quality, it is brilliant that we have it. But it is expensive and we saw in some instances prices hikes of 15 and 20 per cent this year which I don’t think anyone can stand over.“What we don’t want to do though is throw the baby out with the bathwater. And the problem sometimes with legislation is that it goes too far . . . you might actually cause developers to stop building the student accommodation. The risk with the Opposition legislation is that their legislation might go too far,” he added.The Taoiseach said the cost of staying in purpose-built accommodation can be “very high”.“So we agreed to do two things. First of all, to promote digs and the rent a room scheme where there is a lot of supply and also to work over the summer on legislative proposals to limit the increases in the price of student accommodation.“We’ll work over the summer on legislation, in some way, helping to limit the increases in student accommodation so we don’t next year see the kind of increases in prices that we saw this year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers. In Afghanistan, you have no shortage of really interesting issues to cover.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Islamic State terrorist found guilty of plot to kill Theresa MayPrince Charles reveals his gardening inspiration: a hidden Buckingham Palace veg plotGovernment orders Phillip Morris to stop advertising \u0026#34healthier\u0026#34 tobacco products or face legal action Donald Trump designing \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 new Air Force One to be red, white and blueBritish Airways: Reports of delays and cancellations at Heathrow as airline reports \u0026#39systems issue\u0026#39Thai cave rescue: Trauma expert says journalists\u0026#39 questions could affect boys\u0026#39 recoveryLaptop of Poppi Worthington\u0026#39s father that could \u0026#39solve mystery\u0026#39 of little girl\u0026#39s death discovered by police HVP vaccine likely to be rolled out for boys as officials call for \u0026#39gender-neutral\u0026#39 vaccinationsSir Cliff Richard privacy ruling: giving suspects anonymity could stop other \u0026#39victims\u0026#39 coming forward, says Theresa MayTurkey\u0026#39s emergency rule expires as President Erdogan\u0026#39s powers expandDame Margaret Hodge threatened with disciplinary action after calling Jeremy Corbyn an \u0026#39anti-Semite\u0026#39Comment: The ruling on Cliff Richard\u0026#39s privacy case against the BBC is a serious blow to press freedomPrivacy vs Freedom of Expression: How the law has developedTwo rival \u0026#39mega mansions\u0026#39 in LA\u0026#39s Bel Air vying to become America\u0026#39s most expensive homeDonald Trump\u0026#39s bodyguard dies after suffering stroke while protecting president on his Scottish golf courseComment: Boris Johnson could have finished Theresa May.

Prof Sauer has booked into the usual hotel, but is travelling with his son from a previous marriage instead of the German chancellor, according to a report in the Neue Südtiroler Tageszeitung newspaper.Angela Merkel on holiday in Solda with her husband Joachim Sauer  Mrs Merkel’s office on Wednesday refused to comment on the reports. “As a matter of principle we give no information on the chancellor’s private appointments,” a spokesman said.With Berlin starved of political drama by the annual summer lull, there was speculation the change might be a sign the country is approaching the end of an era.Mrs Merkel had to fight off a crisis that at one point looked like it could topple her government earlier this month, after Horst Seehoer, her interior minister, threatened to resign over migrant policy.But the moment of crisis is past and Mrs Merkel managed to cling on to power, albeit at the cost of considerable loss to her personal authority.There is no obvious immediate threat in the air, but after such a tumultuous few weeks she may feel she cannot risk leaving the German capital.Mr Seehofer has continued to provoke controversy with his moves since and she may feel she needs to keep an eye on him.Or she may have decided to hang around to deal with the aftershocks from Donald Trump’s chaotic visit to last week’s Nato summit, at which he turned on Germany. Or the chancellor may have some other, private reason to change her holiday plans.Another of the Merkels’ summer rituals, however, looks to survive. The couple are set to to travel together to the annual Wagner festival in Bayreuth next week.Please review our commenting policyIslamic State terrorist found guilty of plot to kill Theresa MayPrince Charles reveals his gardening inspiration: a hidden Buckingham Palace veg plotGovernment orders Phillip Morris to stop advertising \u0026#34healthier\u0026#34 tobacco products or face legal action Donald Trump designing \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 new Air Force One to be red, white and blueBritish Airways: Reports of delays and cancellations at Heathrow as airline reports \u0026#39systems issue\u0026#39Thai cave rescue: Trauma expert says journalists\u0026#39 questions could affect boys\u0026#39 recoveryLaptop of Poppi Worthington\u0026#39s father that could \u0026#39solve mystery\u0026#39 of little girl\u0026#39s death discovered by police HVP vaccine likely to be rolled out for boys as officials call for \u0026#39gender-neutral\u0026#39 vaccinationsSir Cliff Richard privacy ruling: giving suspects anonymity could stop other \u0026#39victims\u0026#39 coming forward, says Theresa MayTurkey\u0026#39s emergency rule expires as President Erdogan\u0026#39s powers expandDame Margaret Hodge threatened with disciplinary action after calling Jeremy Corbyn an \u0026#39anti-Semite\u0026#39Comment: The ruling on Cliff Richard\u0026#39s privacy case against the BBC is a serious blow to press freedomPrivacy vs Freedom of Expression: How the law has developedTwo rival \u0026#39mega mansions\u0026#39 in LA\u0026#39s Bel Air vying to become America\u0026#39s most expensive homeDonald Trump\u0026#39s bodyguard dies after suffering stroke while protecting president on his Scottish golf courseComment: Boris Johnson could have finished Theresa May.

Born in\u0026nbspBrieg, Prussia (now Poland), he trained on piano, cello, organ and percussion.As a youth he was forced to play in\u0026nbspVolkssturm, an army band established by the Nazis in late 1944,\u0026nbspbtut\u0026nbspan inoperable injury to his hand at the age of 16 meant he had permanent tendon problems.The injury forced him to move away from playing instruments and into conducting, and was also why he never used a baton. From the\u0026nbspKimsche\u0026nbspOper\u0026nbspto Dresden Philharmonic, he led numerous orchestras and opera companies throughout the newly formed post-war East Germany.Most notably in his time in Europe, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspbecame leader of the Leipzig\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0026nbspin 1970, one of the continent\u0027s most prestigious orchestras, and held the position for 26 years. Such was his influence from powerful conducting and musicianship, he convinced East German Chancellor Eric Honecker to rebuild the\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0027 concert hall.His force of will also allowed him to overcome the challenges of the era and take the orchestra on international tours. But it was in 1989 that arguably his greatest moment would come. Political upheaval was in the air as the Soviet Union collapsed, and as thousands of Leipzig residents took to the streets to protest, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspwould take on a stunning public role.On 9 October he invited the masses into his orchestra\u0027s concert hall and held what was likely the first public debate East Germany had known. His cultural status had afforded Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspa measure of soft power, but this was different. This was quite a moment for a man who had never been a member of East Germany\u0027s ruling Communist party.“No one knew what would happen, and I had only some minutes to decide .... But I also knew that if I didn\u0027t do something I would regret it for the rest of my life,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspin 1994.32101 Studio for Electronic MusicGoogle Doodle

He remained as music director from 1991 to 2002, while holding the\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0026nbspjob simultaneously until 1996.

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He\u0027s been with Alex for five days, give him a break.In case you missed it, the moment Dani lost it with Dr Alex...Back to \u0027reality\u0027, Dr Alex and Alex have gone aside to have a chat. It seems they\u0027re both agreeing to not be exclusive. Dr Alex really can talk his way out of anything.And here we have - what we are being led to believe - the biggest event of the year:\u0026nbspJack and Dani\u0027s trip to the shop. Big breast chickens and fishy Dani being put in the trolley, it\u0027s like they\u0027ve never been out of the house before they\u0027re so excited.The sheer joy and excitement at the prospect of the two of them doing a quick shop is terrifying. Are these people okay? Should we be helping rescue them from this bizarre house?DING DING text time. Is it announcing an exciting new contestant? Or maybe a shock eviction? Nope, it\u0027s the earth-shattering news that Jack and Dani are going to pop to the supermarket and get some food.Our hero, Dani, has called out Dr Alex for palming off Lady Alex because some girl with a surfboard has come in. She got so riled up she walked off and left the boys to it. Oh dear.Despite the steamy bathroom kiss, it looks like Dani and New Josh are getting close. What happened to Loyal Georgia?Sam thought his kiss with Georgia was a secret thing. I\u0027m guessing he forgot all about the many, many, many cameras.Our top villa therapist is at it again. Dani Dyer giving sound advice to all the islanders, peppered with some truly brilliant cockney rhyming slang.The moment we all knew was coming, Sam and Georgia share a secret kiss in the bathroom...Now we have Queen Dani consoling heartbroken Alex and Laura (okay, heartbroken might be a little far, pissed off is probably more accurate) on the rooftop. I think we all need a Dani Dyer in our lives.Jack can\u0027t even hide how smug he looks about the prospect of getting to know the two new girls. Have some class Jack.After swirling rumours in the build up to the show, there\u0027s still no news on who is leaving the villa. If anyone does leave, I\u0027m sure in classic\u0026nbspLove Island\u0026nbsp​style it\u0027ll be left until the last possible minute.And there we have it. Sam and Georgia are kissing in the bathroom despite having split up two days ago.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis is a nightmare, Sam says. Yes, sleeping in a luxury villa, not having to work, with free food and drink. How horrifying for you.And this is why we love Old Jack (as in Dani\u0027s Jack) so much. Laura just called one of the new women chick, to which he incredulously repeated back chick?!. Yes Jack.Apologies for that lapse in memory there, that was new contestant Stephanie who was talking to Jack.Jack is having a heart-to-heart with...erm...blimey it would really help if the islanders wore name badgesTwo breakups in six weeks. Fair play Laura, that is pretty intense.

In its first annual Media Nations report, Ofcom credited Netflix and Amazon\u0027s focus on creating original content for its subscribers as a key driver of growth.More than a third of Netflix (38 per cent) subscribers cite ‘to watch original series made by the provider’ as a reason for signing up (up from 30 per cent\u0026nbspin Q1 2017), the report stated.Sharon White, Ofcom’s chief executive, said: “Today’s research finds that what we watch and how we watch it are changing rapidly, which has profound implications for UK television.\u0026nbspWe have seen a decline in revenues for pay TV, a fall in spending on new programmes by our public service broadcasters, and the growth of global video streaming giants. These challenges cannot be underestimated.She added:\u0026nbsp“But UK broadcasters have a history of adapting to change. By making the best British programmes and working together to reach people who are turning away from TV, our broadcasters can compete in the digital age.”The latest\u0026nbspfigures from Ofcom do not take into account people watching shows and films through illegal streaming platforms, which has become a constantly evolving battle for copyright holders, broadcasters and regulators.Today\u0027s figures from Ofcom are a landmark on the road we have been walking down for a long time, said Chris Anderson, head of film and TV at digital piracy authority MUSO.\u0026nbspIn reality, with piracy figures considered, streaming probably overtook traditional TV long ago – but piracy audiences are overlooked by TV broadcasters, streaming services, and regulators to their detriment.Figures from MUSO\u0026nbspshow that global piracy has increased year-on-year, with more than 4 billion visits to film and TV piracy sites in the UK in 2017.While it may seem counter intuitive, Mr Anderson suggests the traditional broadcasting industry should look to viewers lost to illegal piracy sites in order to better compete against the legitimate streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.If UK broadcasters are serious about their mission to adapt their revenue streams to compete in the digital age, they need to not only consider the audiences lost to legitimate streaming services but also illegitimate ones, he said.Piracy audiences are one of the great untapped pools of wealth - they have extremely high intent to access content but are often simply unable to. Finding ways to access this audience could be the secret bringing higher profits back to broadcasting.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many scientists have argued that while the name is eye-catching, it lacks the geological evidence to back it up.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There is a glaring lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff at senior civil service levels across the community.“And although 31 per cent of the senior civil servants in MI5 are women, that figure is considerably lower – around 25 per cent – across the other agencies and rest of the intelligence community” the MPs said.The report stated that only GCHQ, the government’s communications headquarters, have any black or Asians in the senior category. However, after its publication, MI5 wanted to point out that ethnic minority members have moved to senior positions in the last year.Dominic Grieve, chairman of the ISC, said: “In an increasingly competitive employment market, it is important that the UK intelligence community is able to attract, and draw upon, the skill, talent and experience of all sectors of our society – to reflect, protect and promote our values, and keep our nation safe.“It is essential that these organisations reflect the UK of today with a erse and inclusive workforce. Diversity encourages challenge, drives innovation and ensures better decision making – whilst this is important in any organisation or sector, it is an operational imperative for the intelligence community.”The ISC report looked at ersity and inclusivity\u0026nbspat MI6, MI5, GCHQ, Defence Intelligence Agency, The Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), National Security Secretariat (NSS) and Joint Intelligence Organisation (JIO) in compiling the report.MI6 release first advert in 110 year history“If you look at Chilcot and the Iraq problems and what went wrong ... in large part this was about groupthink and groupthink is manifestly more likely to happen when you have the same sort of people seating around a table, so I also think in terms of quality of our decision making, it is absolutely key.”Andrew Parker, head of MI5, pointed out that his service and its staff must reflect British society as a whole, the values it represents and have a common aim to combat the threat of groups like Isis. And that is one of the main “reasons why you would want to have a erse workforce.”Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, held that striving for ersity meant\u0026nbsp “changing the perception of a career in the intelligence community so that men and women from every part of society can imagine themselves thriving in the intelligence and security world.”The ISC report, Diversity and Inclusion in the UK Intelligence Community, examined four key protected characteristics under the 2010 Equality Act – gender, race, sexuality and disability. It pointed out that MI5 and MI6 have both appeared in lists of the top 50 employers for women and those two agencies as well as GCHQ and the Home Office are included in the top 100 employers category of the LGBT rights group, Stonewall.“However, as many of the people we have spoken to have acknowledged, there is much still to be done,” said the report. One of the problems with ethnic minority recruitment, said the ISC, is security vetting “which is bureaucratic, takes too long and is widely considered by many of those we met to be an inhibitor to ersity and nationality rules, and that the wider public often has inaccurate and outdated perceptions about the agencies in particular, and the type of staff they are now looking to recruit”.Caroline Flint, one of the Committee members, said:\u0026nbsp“More must be done by the agencies to collect data about ersity, it is difficult to carry through a policy unless you have the data to work.” The report said that MI6 in particular have done well by returning to the “ tap on the shoulder” approach to recruitment. Ms Flint wanted to stress “ This does not mean concentrating on places like gentlemen’s clubs, but going to schools and colleges. Many people at the agencies are working hard at this, so pupils and students can relate to them.”UK news in picturesPro-EU demonstrators wave flags outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.Theresa May arives to open the Farnborough AirshowNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

The people at the top get it the young people coming in are ready for new ideas, but it may take the mid-ranking people a bit longer, all managers should, of course, be encouraged to be involved.”The report suggested mentoring as well as “reverse mentoring” as ways to promote ersity. “We believe that\u0026nbsp both would be useful. Reverse mentoring would be a good way for senior, older people to understand what people from under-represented groups feel,”\u0026nbspsaid Lord Janvrin.A Government spokesperson said: “As the report states, we have made significant progress in recent years, but there is clearly more to do. We remain committed to further improving this and will give full consideration to the conclusions and recommendations of the ISC’s report and respond formally in due course.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

LABOUR CRISIS: MP quits and blasts Jeremy Corbyn as \u0026lsquoCLEAR RISK to ...Len McCluskey, general secretary of Labour\u0027s influential top union donor Unite, said the MP\u0027s departure was no big deal. He resigned from Labour\u0027s values a long time ago.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said, when asked if Mr Woodcock should now spark a by-election: In normal circumstances, if you stand for election on one platform and then decide to abandon the platform you stood on, basic rules of democratic accountability suggest that you should then put that to the electorate.Responding to the MP\u0027s complaints about the inquiry into allegations against him, the spokesman insisted: The sexual harassment procedures of the Labour party are robust and independent of political leadership.The case would have ended up before the party\u0027s elected National Constitutional Committee, which deals with internal discipline matters, he said.The MP\u0027s resignation from the party meant that this would not now happen, so accountability and recourse for the complainant cannot be achieved through Labour Party processes any more.Mr Woodcock claimed in his resignation letter that there was clear evidence the (discipline) process has been manipulated for factional purposes.He accused Labour general secretary Jennie Formby of overturning a previous disciplinary panel ruling, and said Mr Corbyn had refused to appoint an independent investigator to rule on his case.The MP also claimed to have obtained emails showing that senior party figures were determined to prevent him being a Labour candidate in future.One sent in May last year to colleagues from a senior Labour figure reportedly said that we need to deal with Woodcock, and for that matter Peter Mandelson and the others, but it needs to go through a legally sound process.This was before the formal complaint was made against Mr Woodcock, while Lord Mandelson has faced no impropriety claims.John Woodcock quit the party with a scathing attack on Jeremy CorbynMr Woodcock said it was not credible to think he could get a fair hearing, and he would now seek an independent process to hear the case.Mr Corbyn\u0027s spokesman said he was not aware of any discussion or emails about trying to deselect Mr Woodcock and he said the case was handled in a completely rigorous and fair way.He added: He is not the only Labour MP who has often spoken against the party leadership.This is a bit of a red herring and a smokescreen in regard to a serious case that should have been fully investigated.In his resignation letter to Mr Corbyn, Mr Woodcock wrote that he believed more strongly than ever that you have made the Labour Party unfit to deliver on his own promise to fight for local jobs, promote a credible alternative government, protect his local shipyard, which produces the Trident nuclear submarines, and ensure his constituents\u0027 safety through strong defence and national security.The Jewish community has condemned Labour leader Corbyn\u0026rsquos \u0027systematic failure\u0027 to deal with anti-Semitism                    REUTERS1 of 11Jewish groups have accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-SemitismThe party for which I have campaigned since I was a boy is no longer the broad church it has always historically been, wrote the MP.Anti-Semitism is being tolerated and Labour has been taken over at nearly every level by the hard left, far beyond the dominance they achieved at the height of 1980s militancy.There is little chance of returning the Labour Party to the inclusive, mainstream electoral force my constituents desperately need. In these circumstances, I can no longer justify engaging in a rigged process to be re-admitted to it.Father-of-two Mr Woodcock is a former spokesman for then Prime Minister Brown in 2008 and 2009 and was a transport spokesman under Ed Miliband.The former chairman of Labour\u0027s backbench defence committee and of Labour Friends of Israel became an MP in 2010, with a majority of 5,208, and has clashed with Mr Corbyn over issues including nuclear weapons and anti-Semitism. He said before last year\u0027s election that he could not support Mr Corbyn as PM."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/990161_1.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle news thomas markle samantha markle royal news","story":"Samantha Markle, 53, launched a furious tirade against her duchess sibling after Meghan and her new husband Prince Harry visited the Nelson Mandela centenary exhibition in London\u0026rsquos Southbank Centre.She posted on Twitter: \u0026ldquoHow about you pay tribute to your own father?!

the ONS\u0027s preferred inflation measure - remained unchanged at 2.3 per cent.Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, said: Inflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families.That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers \u0026pound160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to \u0026pound7.83 an hour."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"AN explosive monsoon deluge will unleash cascades of rain across parts of Britain before giving...BRITAIN’S heatwave could be halted on Tuesday as temperatures plunge with a “cold front” moving...BBC Weather warned Britain could be two weeks worth of rain in the space of one hour on Friday...THE FRIGHTENING eye of Typhoon Maria has been shown in a shocking video as Taiwan, China and...ENGLAND has enjoyed its hottest day of the year so far – but the heatwave triggered a dramatic...THUNDERSTORMS have triggered flash floods in Kent with streets submerged and railway tracks...SCORCHING temperatures are expected to remain in the UK this week but BBC Weather warned there...THE WEATHER forecast has now predicted soaring temperatures in the UK for the next two weeks....UK WEATHER has taken a turn to the extreme as a major heatwave sets in that is expected to bring...BRITAIN is set to be hit by another heatwave as temperatures reach highs of 31C with no rain or..."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 -

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay. So where better to host it than in England, where the beautiful game was born?We have the stadiums, the transport and the passion — attributes shamefully ignored in recent years by Fifa.It is time that football’s greatest show finally came home. THE British divers who risked their lives to save the trapped Thai boys are true heroes.Their extraordinary, selfless, mission was utterly courageous, especially after a colleague died during the operation.Such heroics should be recognised.

I’ve cried myself to sleep so many times,” says her mum Natalie Cooch, 37, from Stafford.Without somewhere to permanently rest her head, Heather lacks a bedtime routine and is regularly tired and irritable in the mornings.Often sleep deprived, she finds it hard to concentrate throughout the day, which has a detrimental effect on her education.“It’s affecting her terribly,” Natalie explains. “She’s really tired and moody in the mornings.She’s getting into a routine of staying awake for far too long. Her concentration during the day just isn’t what it should be.”Heather and her parents have lived in a string of tiny properties after Natalie’s mother passed away in 2011, forcing Heather and her parents to leave the home they had all shared together.Natalie runs a small business renting out gypsy-style carts and caravans but suffers with anxiety and depression and Heathers dad has a degenerative back problem that prevents him from working.Since 2011, theyve lived in a series of tiny flats and even a house boat.And with next to no money and minimal space, Heather’s parents have been unable to provide their daughter with the bed she desperately needs.“She’s at an age now where she needs her space and wants her own bed. I’m upset that we haven’t been able to provide that for her.Sadly, Heathers isn’t an isolated case.More children are living in relative poverty than at any other time in the past 10 years, with 4.1million children across the UK living below the breadline.Like thousands of other families in crisis, Heather’s parents have turned to Buttle UK, a grant-giving charity that is a lifeline to thousands of families and young people in need.Over the past five years, Dreams Beds has provided charity Buttle UK with nearly 10,000 children’s beds to donate to those families in desperate need.Aiming to help even more children, The Sun joined forces with Dreams Beds to launch the Beds for Kids campaign.This means for every bed or mattress bought at Dreams Beds, one will be donated to Buttle UKs Chances for Children campaign.Our initiative is helping 3,000 children in need of a good night’s sleep - children just like Heather.Heather and her family have moved into a two-bedroom council house in Hilderstone, Stafford, so we sent the Dreams Beds delivery lorry out out on a very special delivery for the 11-year-old.After hearing that a bed of her very own was finally on the way after seven long years, Heather told The Sun: “I’m looking forward to having my own room and sleeping in a clean, comfy bed. I haven’t had a bed in so long.“I can have my friends round and have sleepovers all the time.”When the doorbell rang, Heather rushed to welcome the delivery drivers. She was smiling from ear-to-ear as she showed them up to her new room.Once it had been assembled, mum Natalie helped her make the bed - and with her new pink pillows nicely plumped, Heather dived straight in.I love it and I’m never getting out,” she said.The Sun would like to thank all our amazing readers for supporting the Beds for Kids campaign so far. THERE are 400,000 children in the UK who do not have a bed. Without somewhere to rest their head, bedtime routines become difficult, stress levels rise and getting a good night’s sleep is almost impossible.Below are three ways you can support our Beds for Kids campaign.FOR every bed or mattress bought from Dreams Beds stores across the country, one will be donated to Buttle UKs Chances for Children campaign.Simply take the voucher below into any Dreams Beds store when you buy a bed or mattress and you will be making a big difference to a child’s life.READERS can also donate directly to the charity through the Beds for Kids page at mydonate.bt/charities/bedsforkids or via your Sun Savers wallet.YOU can also buy a copy of the specially created book, That’s No Place To Sleep.It tells the story of Sleepy Simon’s quest for a bed to sleep in.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up. Who do they think they are kidding — us or themselves? “There are none so blind as those who will not see.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Except they haven’t. Theresa May’s proposal to the EU isn’t the grim “reality” of Brexit. It is merely what happens when negotiated ineptly, by Remainers.They further argue we should choose between no-deal, Mrs May’s proposal or staying in. Why? The first vote determined we were leaving. The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot.

It was a football jolly, sealing a month-long PR triumph for the Kremlin.Macron should have watched from Paris.TAKING back control of our borders won’t mean a thing if we fail to exercise it.It is worrying that immigration has gone up again thanks to a 13-year high in those arriving from outside the EU — which the Government CAN limit.For years the totals have been too great for our communities to cope with.

And it said the DWP should provide a figure for the total amount claimants have missed out on, along with an explanation of how it will provide “appropriate remedies”.The committee said: “There is clearly much more to be done to right this wrong. We encourage the department to act swiftly, decisively and comprehensively to address the harm caused by this mistake and, more broadly, to give much greater priority to correcting benefit underpayments to vulnerable people.”Those affected were people whose ability to work is affected by disability or illness, who were transferred from the old incapacity benefit on to ESA from 2011 onwards. Some 70,000 ended up being underpaid for years, losing an average of £5,000, found the report. Of these, more than 20,000 of those most in need are owed around £11,500 each and some as much as £20,000.The report found that the “unacceptable and entirely avoidable” situation came about because of “multiple failures” by the DWP. The department failed to listen to staff, claimants or experts when they warned that things were going wrong and failed to scrutinise its own processes properly or to ensure that they reflected the legislation, said the committee.And a “culture of indifference” at the department meant it took more than six years to take action, even though it was “painfully obvious” that a significant number of claimants were being underpaid.“Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of Government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA,” said Ms Hillier.“The department simply didn’t listen to what claimants, experts, support organisations and its own staff were saying. Its sluggishness in correcting underpayments, years after it accepted responsibility for the error, points to weaknesses at the highest levels of management. Indifference has no place in the delivery of vital public services. It must be rooted out wherever it is found.“The department needs to explain what it is doing to improve both its management culture and its ability to gather and act promptly on critical intelligence.“It must also set out how it will more quickly address the £1.7 billion of underpayments claimants miss out on each year.”A DWP spokesman said: “We take the issue of underpayments very seriously and have actively taken steps to put this right as quickly as possible, to ensure people get the support they are entitled to. We have recruited 400 extra staff and have already started making payments - over £40 million so far. We have continued to provide regular updates to both the PAC and the House in regards to the progress of these repayments, and will continue in this stead.”In a separate development, the chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee wrote to employment minister Alok Sharma to raise concerns over benefit sanctions data supplied by the DWP.Frank Field said that the department’s published data “consistently understate” the sanctions applied to claimants by removing those who have successfully appealed against decisions.And he queried the decision to sanction 1,108 Universal Credit claimants in February alone despite them being judged medically unfit to work or look for work.“What is the point of applying sanctions to people who cannot work and are not expected to look for jobs?” asked Mr Field. Benefit sanctions are the only major welfare reform this decade to have never been evaluated, and the picture DWP paints of the policy doesn’t match the troubling stories we’ve heard.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them. It just marks them “disturbing” and limits them to users claiming to be over 18. Virtually everyone, in other words.A moderator, sickeningly, tells an undercover reporter: “If you start censoring too much, people lose interest in the platform. It’s all about making money.”Since Facebook apparently now considers itself a publisher it must be treated as such.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gavin Millar QC, for the BBC, had argued at the hearing that the case raised \"issues of great, arguably of constitutional, importance for the freedom of the press in this country.\"He said that if Sir Cliff\u0027s claim were successful it would undermine the long-standing press freedom to report the truth about police investigations.Any change in the law should be a matter for parliament, the barrister had argued.Outside court, the BBC\u0027s director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth said the case marked a \"significant shift\" against press freedom.An \"important principle\" around the public\u0027s right to know was at stake, she added.The BBC is considering whether to appeal against the ruling.It\u0027s important to stress that the judgment deals only with the position of suspects under police investigation.There is no suggestion - at least for now - that it will be unlawful for journalists to name defendants when they are charged.But unless this ruling is overturned on appeal, news organisations will have to restrict the way they report police investigations.So too will users of social media, though they may not be worth suing.Reporters will need to make sure, before naming a suspect, that the public interest in reporting outweighs the individual\u0027s right to privacy.Many journalists will err on the side of caution.The BBC defended this case because it felt it had to stand up for media freedom."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-ian-paisley-dup-democratic-unionist-party_4365199.jpg?20180718143934 ","title":"england fans were frightened away from world cup russia claims","story":"In the past few weeks, in nearby Amesbury, Dawn Sturgess died from exposure to the agent and her partner Charlie Rowley remains in hospital.They are thought to have been exposed when they touched a contaminated bottle.Ms Zakharova likened discussing the Salisbury nerve agent attack on the Skripals to being as traditional as drinking tea in England.She repeated the Russian claim that there are still \"no facts\" and that instead there are \"absurd fake stories\" and \"fake news\".

But at the moment we don\u0027t know which scenario we are planning for.\"At the moment the EMA says one thing, the UK regulator says another.

A spokesman for the leader of the opposition described Margaret Hodge\u0027s behaviour as unacceptable and confirmed that formal disciplinary action would be taken. And he said she had broken the rules for Labour MPs and had brought the party into disrepute. The ex-minister, who is herself Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust, confronted the Labour leader after the party\u0027s ruling NEC body approved a new anti-Semitism code which has been condemned by the Jewish community . She reportedly called the Labour leader a f***ing anti-Semite and a racist in an extraordinary exchange in the House of Commmons. The clash was seen by several MPs and took place behind the Speaker\u0027s chair seconds after MPs had voted on crunch Brexit legislation on Tuesday night. Mrs Hodge allegedly told Mr Corbyn: “You’re a f***ing anti-Semite and a racist. You have proved you don’t want people like me in the party”.   Labour MPs help Theresa May dodge no-confidence vote which could have triggered Tory-toppling general election  Mr Corbyn replied: “I’m sorry you feel like that.” Mrs Hodge confirmed the exchange to the Jewish Chronicle but denied swearing. A Labour party source said Mrs Hodge was aggressive while Mr Corbyn was calm. Writing for the , she said: “I chose to confront Jeremy directly and personally to express my anger and outrage. I stand by my action as well as my words. “My grandmother and my uncle were murdered by Hitler and many cousins were slaughtered in the gas chambers ... I joined the Labour party to fight racism. To find myself 50 years later, in 2018 confronting antisemitism in my own party is completely and utterly awful.” Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said: “The behaviour that you’re talking about is clearly unacceptable under Labour Party Parliamentary rules for behaviour between colleagues and action will be taken over it. “Of course all concerns of all MPs need to be discussed and addressed, and Jeremy is always open to discussing those with members of the Labour party.  He added: “The rules of the Parliamentary Labour Party specify that behaviour between colleagues must be respectful and not bring the party into disrepute.” Asked whether there would be an investigation, when action would be taken and for any detail on what action would be taken, the spokesman repeatedly said: “Action will be taken.” Labour\u0027s Wes Streeting was one of many who tweeted in defence of the Barking MP. He said: Margaret Hodge is a first class parliamentarian and MP. She beat back the BNP in Barking, she’s not about to be intimidated by off the record briefing - and she’s not alone.

Despite all her pain, Prime Minister seemed to emerge unscathed tonight from a crunch address to warring backbenchers in Parliament. It couldn\u0027t have started more awkwardly. The purple-clad PM was made to wait for around five minutes outside the wood panelled Commons Committee Room 14. Asked about her prospects for survival she said: I think you know the answer to that.  And asked if she would be watching Boris Johnson\u0027s resignation speech on catch-up tonight, she coolly said she would be doing my red box instead.  But once inside she received the usual rapturous welcome - a drumbeat of desk-banging like a herd of sheep crossing a rickety bridge.  Of course, having an audience of dozens of waiting journalists outside the wood-panelled room made it more theatre than reality. But the dramatics weren\u0027t just saved for the brave faces outside the room. Inside, an MP publicly announced he had withdrawn his letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister - which he submitted just eight days earlier. MPs described Simon Clarke\u0027s moment as “electric” and a moment of “theatre”. Theresa May swept out of the meeting smiling but said nothing to waiting journalists. One Cabinet minister declared MPs had “come to their senses” and shown they could “hang together and support the Prime Minister”. Mr Clarke told journalists afterwards: We’ve looked into the abyss in the last few days.”   He said he was deeply opposed to her Chequers deal, but had withdrawn his letter because of “the threat from a Corbyn government or no Brexit at all.  He added: This was a personal decision. “We’ve all been through the mill in the last few weeks and I have to make the decisions.” Asked for Mrs May’s reaction Mr Clarke said: “It was classic Prime Minister. She doesnt buckle under pressure and she doesn’t revel in the good moments. “I imagine some relief”. The message - to journalists outside at least - was one of unity. One MP told the Mirror: She said we’re going on to take the fight to the opponents and we’re going to win.

And there is precedent - in times of crisis, such as financial crash or war, Britain has had Grand Coalitions of all political parties who come together in the national interest. We did it in the First World War and the Second. We also did it during the Depression, when financial crisis meant the Labour government couldn\u0027t agree what to do, the extremes of Left and Right were agitating, and King George V stepped in to demand a national government instead.  So Anna Soubry wasn\u0027t talking entirely out of her bum when she said: Jacob Rees-Mogg is running the country... This really should concern everybody about the state of democracy... I think we need a government of national unity.  The current government is split over Brexit, the Prime Minister is having a limb removed by backbenchers every day, and while they scrap over the most important thing to affect our country in a generation we are heading towards a Brexit deadline that will likely have the same impact as an angle grinder on a snoozing face.  If we crash out without a deal, farm subsidies stop at midnight. Borders close, tariffs kick in, the City can\u0027t do business and Northern Ireland will have the peacekeeping lights turned off.  Save us, Queenie! Step in and tell these turds to put politics aside and act in the national interest.  Which is a lovely idea, until you realise who\u0027d be running it. Winston Churchill is not available, which leaves two choices.  The first is that some of the current crop form a government. The PM would need to be a party leader, which means Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Vince Cable, Ian Blackford for the People\u0027s Republic of Scotland or Nigel Dodds of the Northern Ireland Wingnuts.  Traditionally they lead a Cabinet mixed of all parties, but balanced politically slightly in the other direction, for fairness. So Comrade Corbyn would need to lead a majority Tory cabinet, St Theresa would be in charge of a mostly-Labour front bench, and Grandad Cable would pirouette at the despatch box while in charge of a government that doesn\u0027t watch Strictly Come Dancing.  Let\u0027s not think what the cabinets of Dodds or Blackford would be like. There\u0027d be blood on the shagpile either way. The Queen could nominate a non-leader as PM, but seeing as no-one has yet found a genius-level unicorn it\u0027s unlikely they\u0027d get cross-party support, which means back to square one. There is a second option. Which would be to appoint those politicians who did the jobs for longest, and thus have the most experience. Whatever your politics, it would be hard to argue that knowing what you\u0027re doing is a luxury unnecessary to untangling Brexit.  Of course, you cannot reanimate our first and longest-serving PM Robert Walpole, who was in charge from 1721 to 1742 and even doubled up as Chancellor for some of it. You\u0027ve got to choose the person who was PM for longest and is still alive.   There are many people who hanker after a return to the optimism of 1997, not least Tony Blair. And about as many who hanker after stringing him up for war in Iraq, which is a good chunk of the current Labour Party.  But then who is our longest-serving and surviving Chancellor, to be alongside him? Ah.   I liked Gordon Brown. He was sincere and intelligent, which always helps, and bailing out the banks in 2008 saved the UK from disaster. But the Tories can\u0027t see him without squealing borrowing! like little piggies who have forgotten George Osborne.  And we all know how Blair and Brown got on when they were in Downing Street before. They\u0027re still patching up the plaster.  Anyway. Longest serving foreign secretary? Jack Straw, which would be torture in more ways than one. Home secretary? Theresa, who at least comes with her own \u0027go home\u0027 van we could bundle her into.  And health of course is important. The NHS is the closest we come to having a national religion these days, and we need someone that can be trusted not to cock it up.  Ah, bugger.    In short, all the obvious candidates for a government of national unity are either people who are already clearly incompetent, or the New Labour government of 1997.  And it\u0027s doubtful that even Blair at his most messianic, even Brown with the most clunking of fists, could find a way to impose border checks in a place where you\u0027re not allowed a border, trade with a union of 27 nations without following a single one of its rules, keep farm payments without contributions, stop Kent becoming a lorry park, save the car industry, and then find a way for the City to do financial deals without complying with the EU, all in the space of eight months.  On the plus side, they\u0027d make Mogg look like the fusty out-of-touch imagineer he is. And the 1930s coalitions led to Ramsay MacDonald, arguably one of the country\u0027s greatest Prime Ministers, being expelled from the Labour Party, disowned by the unions, and subsequently winning the biggest landslide in British history - against the official Labour candidate.  If we had a MacDonald, perhaps we could do it. But we don\u0027t.  But there is, in typical Blair style, a third way.  And that is to cancel Brexit. Not because it means ignoring the will of the people, and not because democracy is dead. But because democracy got buggered.  The referendum was invalid, because only one of the two choices the people were presented with was possible. Remaining was always an option, but Leave was not. The ballot paper, to be valid, should have asked us to choose between \u0027Remain\u0027 and \u0027Leave the EU, Northern Ireland, and thereby dissolve the United Kingdom\u0027. Never mind all the add-ons about single markets and customs unions - to Leave meant a province of 1.8million British citizens was told to go hang, and it should have said so.  The will of the people is also changing. Leavers have started to see that belief is not enough, and dreaming doesn\u0027t get you financial passporting rights. Reality is biting, and if the will of the people changes then so must government policy, whatever Theresa says.     There are allegations democracy was interfered with using illegally-harvested data, that the Russians were tinkering with it and election laws were broken. There\u0027s enough evidence to say the vote was unsafe.  And in the absence of anyone capable of carrying it out, what choice is there? Politicians voting against their own constituents, voting with their constituents even when they know it\u0027s wrong, being sent home early and haggling over leadership, while the whole nation is chained to a clown car pointed at the English Channel and picking up speed. Brexit wasn\u0027t an option. Brexit won\u0027t work. Brexit will hurt us all, and it will hurt the people who voted for it the most. So come on, Queenie. Do your bit. Point out the iceberg and steer us around it - tell Theresa the United Kingdom is not up for negotiation, and the whole country will back you. There simply is no other solution.

Fourteen years ago, when the first film came out, Jack was aged two.  He\u0027d also just been given days to live after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.      Today Claire views Jack as her very own superhero after he survived against the odds. Jack is now ticking off the milestones just like any other teenager and Claire was recently proud to see him attend his prom. She blinked back tears of joy as she snapped photos of her smiling 16-year-old looking handsome in his blue three-piece suit. It’s a life-stage Clare and husband David once feared they’d never see their son reach.   “After Jack was diagnosed with a brain tumour, I’d lie awake for hours at night fearing he’d never reach his milestones,” said Claire from Durham.         “Would he be able to go to nursery, school, do exams, go to prom, ever get a job? So I could have burst with pride when I waved him off to his prom.”              Jack was diagnosed with a brain tumour in December 2004 at the age of two, when doctors said he had just days to live. For five months, his worried parents had taken him back and forth to doctors. His symptoms started with being sick each morning, not eating and losing weight, which was put down to reflux. But as he got progressively more ill and was barely able to stand up, he was referred for an MRI scan at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital.  “Had our doctor not done that, our story wouldn’t have ended so happily as Jack was so ill by this stage, the surgeon said he had days to live, ”said Claire.     The family’s “terrifying” ordeal started in July 2004.         “Jack started getting a bit sick in the mornings but then it got worse and he’d take longer to recover,” said Claire.              “He was unsteady on his feet but so are most two-year-olds, so it wasn’t something that was obvious.”       “As he got more and more ill, all he ever said was, ‘put me to bed, Mammy’. Thirteen years on, it still makes me cry thinking about it.”               Finally, after his MRI scan, Claire and David were told the devastating news no parent thinks they’ll ever hear – their little boy had a brain tumour.         The tumour had a large cyst on the back, which was blocking the fluid leaving Jack’s brain, and he was put on steroids to reduce swelling.         Three days after being diagnosed, Jack had a four-hour operation to remove most of the tumour.         “It was the most terrifying experience of our lives,” said Claire.         Jack was in intensive care for a week and was allowed home two days before Christmas.         “We were told to keep Jack quiet and calm – easier said than done!” said Claire.         “He hadn’t felt this good for so long he really made the most of it.               “As he was obsessed with The Incredibles, which had come out the month before, we bought him a Mr Incredible costume and Hannah an Elastigirl one for Christmas – they hardly took them off and ran round the house playing superheroes.”              Biopsy results revealed Jack’s tumour was a low-grade (non-cancerous) pilocytic astrocytoma.  “We were overwhelmed with relief when we were told it was unlikely the tumour would grow back, and got back to our normal routine, ’ said Claire. “ Jack had scans every three months and then every six months.”      But 18 months later, they were dealt another shattering blow when a scan revealed Jack’s tumour had grown back.             “We did a six-month period of ‘watch and wait’ to see if the growth would continue,” said Claire.               “The waiting was torture.               “Our GP had suggested we make memories so that’s what we tried to do, but our family fell apart as the fear took over.”               A second operation in October 2007 was unsuccessful. By then, Jack had started school, but missed most of reception.         After surgery, all Claire longed to do was comfort her son.        “But this time, Jack knew what was going to happen and blamed us for letting them do this to him,” said Claire.           “He wouldn’t speak to us for the first week after surgery – he’d just turn his head the other way and close his eyes.”               Jack’s next scan revealed the tumour had got bigger and he was put on ‘watch and wait’ again.         In December 2010 when Jack was eight, he underwent brain surgery for the third time, which successfully removed the tumour.         Despite everything, Newcastle United fan Jack played for his local football team for five seasons and took his GCSEs in June.         In July last year, doctors gave him the all-clear and he doesn’t need to have any more scans.         “We were so happy and overwhelmed with relief, but there were floods of tears,” said Claire.         “I think 13 years of hidden emotions all came out.         “To look at Jack, you would never know what he’s been through - except for the large scar up the back of his head.        “But he – and the whole family – are still living with the emotional impact.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple split up 20s made","story":"NewsCouple split up in their 20s but made pact to get married if they were still single at 40 - now they haveMairi Gordon, 45 and Rhys McLellan, 43, split in 1995 and said they\u0027d reunite if they were still single in their 40s\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByEllie Forbes17:10, 18 JUL 2018Updated17:54, 18 JUL 2018NewsMairi Gordon and Rhys McLellan split up in 1995 but reunited years later and are now married (Image: Mairi Gordon / SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former couple who said they\u0027d get married if they were still single at 40 have tied the knot. Mairi Gordon, 45 and Rhys McLellan, 43, from Leith, Edinburgh, went out in their 20s but split in 1995. They jokingly agreed that if they were still both single at 40 they would marry – a promise that’s now come true. The couple had a chance meeting years later and fell in love all over again, reports the Daily Record . Make-up artist Mairi, said: “I never forget the day we split up when we were young.  We said to each other if we are still single at the age of 40 we would get married. I still can’t believe that we did it.” Mairi, who describes Rhys as the love of her life, said she randomly bumped into the electrician for the first time since they broke up in 2009. She said: “I went to a fashion show with a friend who had been organising it for St Columba’s Charity. “Rhys was a volunteer for the charity and we all went for a drink after the show. “There was definitely a spark between us but nothing was acted upon as we were both in committed relationships. I was living in Cornwall and he was in Leith, Edinburgh, at the time.”  Three years later, Mairi moved back to the capital after splitting up with her long-term boyfriend of 12 years. While apart, neither Mairi nor Rhys got married or had children. And while Rhys had a few relationships, he was single for most of their time apart. She said: “I bumped into his mum and sister in a shop in Leith, they gave me his number and I called him for a catch-up. “We met but I was still hurting from the previous break-up so again nothing happened and we parted ways. “The next year, I heard Rhys’s mother was in hospital with cancer – I called him to pass on my condolences and to find out how she was doing.  “We started to date for a few months after as we were getting close again. “But I was feeling scared about getting hurt and about us getting back together again, so I ended it even though I had feelings for him.” It wasn’t until 2015 when the childhood sweethearts finally decided to give it another go after Mairi had an accident. She said: “We bumped into each other again and this time both of us felt the sparks fly. “We were both single and the feeling for each other were still very much there. Soon after I had an accident at work and injured my knee. “He [Rhys] was always there to make me laugh, do some shopping, make me food. “That’s when I realised he was just what I had always wanted and never really stopped loving him.

Louise Young, 29, began suffering from severe skin problems while she was pregnant with her fourth child in 2015.  First blaming her ‘break outs’ on her hormones, Louise was shocked when her skin continued to worsen after her daughter, Angel, two, was born and she was diagnosed with severe cystic acne. Over the past three years Louise tried everything to help her skin from different antibiotics, face washes and even resorted in using her own breast milk as a ‘facemask’ after a midwife recommended it. But now, Louise is sharing her message of how a \u0026pound3 ‘miracle’ acne cream she bought on eBay, TCM Scar and Acne Mark Removal Gel Ointment, has transformed her skin in order to raise awareness to others in a similar situation.  Louise, from Stirling, Scotland, said: “My skin first broke out when I was pregnant with my fourth child but it just continued to get worse even after I’d given birth. “I thought that when my daughter was born it would go away, but it continued to get worse and ruined my self-confidence. “There was a point where I didn’t leave the house for eight weeks because I couldn’t bear to let anyone look at my skin, and nothing I did would help make it better. “I felt as though I had tried everything to sort my skin out – I even put my own breastmilk on my face as I was recommended to from my midwife, but that didn’t work. “As soon as I found this cream my life changed and within two weeks my scarring started to clear up.” After her daughter was born, Louise, a stay-at-home mum, hoped that her skin would return to normal, but it continued to worsen until June this year.

Dr Amita Sahare started her overnight shift as the on-call registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at Basildon Hospital on December 21 2017 at 8pm. The handover left for her did not show the urgency of dealing with Reeta Saidha, 38, who was 15 weeks\u0027 pregnant with her third child, and who she did not see until 11.15pm, she told an inquest in Chelmsford, Essex. Senior Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray asked her if the handover had been thorough enough, saying: Are you saying that at 8pm you did not regard her as an urgent case?  Dr Sahare said she used the handover to prioritise her activity. It did not inform me about the urgency of seeing Mrs Saidha, she said. Dr Sahare recalled it had been a busy labour ward and could not see Mrs Saidha before 11.15pm when she was in bed and complaining of symptoms including abdominal pain, lower back ache and chest pain. Mrs Saidha, of Grays, went into hospital on December 19 2017.  She had been diagnosed with sepsis on December 21 at 1.15pm, the court heard. Dr Sahare said she was told of a lady who had suspected sepsis who needed to be reviewed and had a fever during the afternoon. Lawyers for Mrs Saidha\u0027s family say there were failings in her care, including poor staff communication in handing over Mrs Saidha\u0027s care and seeking input from senior staff, and failure to remove the source of the infection.

Leighanne Bromley, 29, was horrified when she heard a message from members of staff at the RNIB Three Spires Academy in Coventry discussing her 10-year-old son, Harley. They can be heard laughing amongst one another after one staff member says: And make sure he’s off all f***king week What about two weeks? Well don’t tell her that. The voicemail goes on to say: Oh yeah (staff name) did phone you, she just wanted to make sure that Harley is off all week, and the second question is could you keep him off next week as well.  Yes please, till the end of the year. Don’t bring him back until the 27th of July when ( inaudible) we are closed.  Loud laughter can then be heard in the background.  The retail worker and mum-of-one, from Cheylesmore, Coventry, called for the staff members to be sacked – and Three Spires has today confirmed one staff member has been suspended. A spokesman for RNIB said: “We can confirm that one member of staff has been suspended from duties whilst we complete our investigation.” Reacting to the announcement, Leighanne said: “This is what I wanted to happen in the first place. If the school had done what I\u0027d suggested than I wouldn\u0027t have felt like I had no option but to go public. Hopefully this will draw a line under the whole thing. RNIB has been very sympathetic and has totally agreed with me that the school hadn\u0027t done the proper thing in the first place. Leighanne phoned the school around 7.30am on July 10 after Harley had come home the day before [July 9] with a note saying he’d been ill. Shortly afterwards, she missed a call back from the school and received the message.   See below for the voicemail transcript in full    In the voicemail recording, a female member of staff can be heard asking when Harley would be returning to school. Appearing to think she had hung up the phone, she can then be heard saying ‘and make sure he’s off all f***king week’ while another voice asks ‘what about two weeks?’ The staff members can then be heard joking about the possibility of Harley, who was diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder in 2013, being kept off for two weeks or until the end of the year.  A final voice then makes reference to the upcoming summer holidays, retorting ‘don’t bring him back until the 27th of July when inaudible we are closed’.  Leighanne said she has never previously had problems with the school, which Harley has attended as a pupil for the last four and a half years. But she admitted recently she has felt staff were unsympathetic in dealing with Harley’s behavioural issues. Leighanne said: “I looked at my phone I saw I had a missed call from the school and they’d left the voicemail.  “It was then I heard the message. My initial reaction was just shock. My jaw just hit the floor, I was stunned. I couldn’t make it out at first, so I had to listen to it over and over again. “I was just in disbelief. “I’m quite anxious and worried about him attending the school, it just makes me uncomfortable. “He’s a really lovely boy. A lot of the issues he’s had at school I haven’t had at home. “He’s just a sweet, funny little boy with a sweet personality.” In a new statement issued today, Rob Jones, headteacher at RNIB Three Spires Academy, said: “We are sincerely sorry for the offence that has been caused by two staff members at RNIB Three Spires.

Vanessa Strike piled on the pounds when she moved 200 miles away from her home of Middlesbrough. The 28-year-old\u0027s weight reached 16 stone after scoffing on sweet treats all day at her job in a coffee shop. Vanessa would then return home at night and cook three course meals for herself and her husband in Worcester - including favourites like shepherd\u0027s pie and toad in the hole.  But when the super fit mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, she decided to do something about her weight and get healthy, reports Birmingham Live .  Vanessa, who now lives in Worcester, said: I’d always been really fit and healthy right up until my early 20s.  “I’d danced at the same dance school for over 17 years in Middlesbrough and had never worried about my weight, or what I was eating. “But when I got married, my husband got a job down in Worcester, and I totally lost my confidence. “Looking back, it was a really unhappy time for me. “I moved away from my friends and family, from the dance school I loved to a place where I knew no-one and food became my comfort. It became my friend. “It may sound sad, but food became the most exciting part of my day. “I’d eat broken breakfast pastries and cakes throughout the day at work, and drink coffees with syrup and hot chocolates with cream. “Then I’d come home and cook three-course dinners every night.  “We’d always have a starter followed by a huge pasta meal and favourites like toad in the hole and cottage pie. It was a serious health scare that changed Vanessa’s life. Her super-fit mum Sue was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was the wake-up call she needed to start looking after her own health. Four years ago, she decided finally to do something about her weight and lifestyle. “It was such a shock,” recalls Vanessa. “My mum’s the healthiest person in the world. “I said to myself: ‘Why are you taking your health for granted?’ “It made me take a hard long look in the mirror and realise what I was doing to myself, and make the most out of life.” Vanessa swapped breakfast cereals and pastries for high-protein porridge and lean chicken salads.  She started working out at home, until eventually she had enough confidence to join her local gym. “Walking in for the first time was one of the scariest moments of my life,” admits Vanessa. “I would wear a hoody to cover up and I would never take it off, no matter how hot and sweaty I got on the machines. ”Slowly, her confidence began to grow, and she began going to the gym four times a week Soon, she was talking to the other regulars, and one of them suggested that she should enter a body-building competition. “I used to stalk body-builders on social media, I was in awe of them and what they’d done to their bodies,” confesses Vanessa, who now works as a sales advisor. “I mentioned that I’d always wanted to do a competition to one of the guys at the gym – and he said I should do it. “I just laughed at first, but then I thought ‘I’m going to do it for that fat girl’”. Vanessa started training hard and also started ordering her weekly shop from Musclefood, a website that supplies high-protein and low-carb food for people interested in fitness and wellbeing.

The Met Office says this summer is set to beat 1976 to be the hottest summer since records began 108 years ago in 1910.  It could also be one of the driest and sunniest summers ever. And a record 38.5C is possible in the two-week heatwave starting tomorrow night, as schools break up. Temperatures could reach up to 31C over the weekend, with the mid-30s possible from next week as hot conditions last up to two weeks. “Furnace” heat will make scorching highs risk toppling the all-time record 38.5C from next weekend, The Weather Outlook said.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze added: “Computer models show a furnace heat set-up next week with the UK between low pressure to the west and high pressure to the east. “Late July would could head into the mid-30s, with a slim chance of the all-time record 38.5C.” Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “Over 33C ahead is not out of the question. Late July and early August are hot times of the year, and high pressure allows a lot of heating.” A Met Office forecaster added: “The South-East will be locally hot from Friday, and the South, East and North-East very warm from Sunday and Monday. “In the period to July 31, hot or very hot conditions will possibly develop in the South-East.”  Bookmakers Coral cut odds to 2/1 on temperatures beating Britain’s hottest temperature ever recorded, 38.5C on August 10, 2003, at at Brogdale, near Faversham, Kent. Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: “Temperatures will be well in the 30s and we think the record for the hottest ever UK day will tumble.”  Britain baked in 23 days in a row over 27C from June 24 to July 16, peaking at 33.0C on June 28 at Porthmadog, west Wales.      The Met Office said: “Temperatures this summer are remarkable.  If the rest of the summer is average, 2018 will certainly rank in the top 10 warmest summers on record - and if we continue to see above-average temperatures, it could well be record breaking. “June 1 to July 16 had an average daily maximum temperature across the country of 20.9C. The average daily maximum in the hottest summer on record, 1976, was 21C. “And if the rest of the summer was average, we would also be in the top five sunniest summers on record, and in the top 10 driest summers of all time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecasters issue new","story":"NewsUK Weather: Met Office issues new warning of thundery downpours, flooding and power cutsThe Met Office has put out a \u0027yellow warning\u0027 for the South East of England and neighbouring areas\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter12:53, 18 JUL 2018Updated13:52, 18 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Met Office has issued a new weather warning over thundery downpours set to hit parts of the UK. The \u0027yellow warning\u0027 for Friday saying there is also a chance of homes and businesses flooding suddenly at a rapid rate. People could see power cuts where lightening strikes may occur. There is also the potential of transport chaos with road closures and delays possible. A weather map shows the affected area focused mainly on the South East of England, including London. However, the Met Office also suggests that it touches East Midlands, East of England, and South West of England.  Most places will be dry but there is the potential for slow-moving thundery downpours in places, The Met Office says. There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater. Where flooding or lightning strikes occur, there is a chance of delays and some cancellations to train, bus and tube services, particularly during the evening rush hour. Spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions with the possibility of road closures. There is a slight chance that power cuts could occur and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost.  Most parts of the Home Counties could see up to 30mm of rain in just an hour, which raises the possibility of some flash flooding. The weather warning is in place between 2pm and 11.59pm on Friday, July 20. It comes as sun worshippers have enjoyed weeks of scorching weather, with temperatures hitting 31.5C on Monday during the longest heatwave for 42 years. It will start to feel very warm and humid again by the weekend with showers in the north and plenty of sunshine in the south.

But that image was dealt a blow today after Angela Merkel suffered an embarrassing and slightly awkward encounter with a pair of teddy bears. Clad in a smart, royal blue suit and with not a hair-out-place, the Chancellor sat down for a photo opportunity with a group of children at a kindergarten in Cologne this afternoon. But what should have been a chance for Merkel to show off her caring side turned into a toe-curling example of political incorrectness. Unknown to her someone had placed a paid of stuffed animals in a sexually explicit pose behind her. Merkel looks to be giving her best smile for the camera, interacting with the kids and their teacher during crafts time, seemingly completely unaware of the naughty-looking teddy bears behind her.  She was at the Caritas Association kindergarten today meeting kids and staff. The hilarious faux pas could come as another blow to Merkel who is increasingly under pressure to limit immigration in Germany. Last week President Donald Trump added to the pressure by issuing a stark warning to Merkel saying Germany better watch themselves as he blamed terror attacks to European immigration. He added: I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel, great relationship with Germany I think it\u0027s very much hurt Germany, it\u0027s very much hurt other parts of Europe.

Former Navy Seal Saman Gunan was one of the 90 divers who volunteered to help free the Wild Boars football team and end their terrifying 17-day ordeal. But he died on July 6 when he ran out of oxygen while returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks. All of the boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach cried when they were told the tragic news.  The boys were rescued last week, but were only deemed strong enough to be told the heartbreaking news over the weekend. Photos taken at the time they were told show how deeply upset the boys are. Jedsada Chokdamrongsuk, permanent secretary at the health ministry in Thailand, said: All cried and expressed their condolences by writing messages on a drawing of Lieutenant Commander Saman and observed one minute of silence for him. They also thanked him and promised to be good boys.  The boys became trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai earlier this month. All of the boys are still receiving medical care but doctors hope they will be released from hospital tomorrow. They lost an average of 4lbs each and are being monitored for infections.

Bruce McArthur, 66, is accused of murdering at least eight gay men in Toronto, Canada - many of whom he may have picked up in the city\u0027s gay village or on dating apps. The alleged killer - who worked as a gardener and was also a Santa in the local shopping mall - was caught when police arrested him at home, where they found a potential ninth victim tied to the bed. A two week search of a property in the city\u0027s Leaside area, where dad-of-two McArthur was employed as a gardener, led police to human remains buried in potted plants - including small fragments of bone and teeth.  During the search, they found remains from seven different men, reports the New York Post. Police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said: I can confirm that remains were found almost every day we were there. McaArthur was a popular figure in the community and dressed as Santa to entertain children at Christmas. The city of Toronto has never seen anything like this. Forensics are now continuing to search other properties throughout Toronto where McArthur may have had access to via his job. McArthur, who advertised his services as a dominant gay man, was first brought to the attention of police in 2002, when he was arrested for an assault on a gay prostitute.  McArthur reportedly said after turning himself in to police He pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm and received a conditional sentence barring him from the Village and further contact with escorts. After the disappearance of Andrew Kinsman, 49, and Selim Esen, 44, in the summer of 2017, police began investigating McArthur as a suspect in early 2018, placing him on 24 hour police surveillance on January 17. Just one day after their surveillance started, McArthur was seen entering his high-storey apartment with another man. He was arrested before police began the search of the Leaside property, where remains were found on an almost daily basis. McArthur was charged with the murder of Skandaraj Navaratnam, 40, Andrew Kinsman, 49, Selim Esen, 44, and Abdulbasir Faizi, 44, Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, 37, Dean Lisowick, 47, Soroush Mahmudi, 50, and Majeed Kayhan, 58.

That\u0026#8217s higher than Great Britain\u0026#8217s average of 46%.The test centre with the highest pass rate was Golspie, in the Scottish Highlands, where more than three quarters of learners were awarded their licences, while in The Pavilion, in Birmingham, less than a third were successful, making it the toughest.On December 4 last year the driving test was changed, with many observers saying the new test is tougher than the old one.Learners must now navigate for 20 minutes using a sat-nav, and explain how to test the brakes, clean the windscreen and demist your windows while driving. However the new test does not seem to have bothered rookie drivers. In April 2017, under the old test, the pass rate was 48.8%, less than the rate in March 2018, in the new test.The data also shows that 58% of people taking their test for the first time managed to pass, with 142 learners succeeding first time with no minor faults. Drivers taking the test can pass with up to 15 minor faults, such as not checking your mirror at the right time.DVSA deputy chief driving examiner, Gordon Witherspoon, said: \u0026#8220DVSA\u0026#8217s priority is to help everyone through a lifetime of safe driving.\u0026#8220All candidates are assessed to the same level and the result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day.\u0026#8220We expect candidates and instructors to become more familiar with the new test and well continue to monitor the impact of the changes.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mccann wants to see physical sofien moussa in between the posts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has urged striker Sofien Moussa to get himself “between the posts” so he can add goals to his all-round play for Dundee.The Dark Blues front man failed to inspire confidence among the Dens Park support for much of last season.A late flurry of goals saw him finish with 12 in all competitions.And this campaign, he’s already started towards bettering that tally with two goals in the 4-0 win over Stirling Albion on Saturday.That’s despite a howler of a miss with the score at 0-0 before he changed his boots and 10 minutes later knocked in the openerNeil said: “I don’t know if the other boots were a wee bit tight or whatever but it was a super finish for his second one.“He knew I wasn’t happy with the first miss but his control of a great ball from Gense Kusunga was superb and it was a fine finish.

By 2017 this figure had dropped to 20.8%.Smoking rates across the country are down overall.Deborah Arnott, Action on Smoking and Health chief executive, said: \u0026#8220Smoking rates have fallen because over the last twenty years the British Government has gone further and faster in tackling smoking.\u0026#8220Britain has kept its tobacco taxes amongst the highest in the world, banned advertising promotion and sponsorship, put tobacco out of sight in shops and replaced the glitzy, brightly coloured packs with ugly dark packs with large picture warnings.\u0026#8220But smoking must become history for all of society not just for the wealthy.\u0026#8220Cuts in public health funding and lack of treatment for smoking on the NHS mean poorer more heavily addicted smokers, including those who are pregnant, are not getting the help they need to quit.\u0026#8221The data also suggests that more young adults are shunning cigarettes.The percentage of Dundee\u0026#8217s population who have never smoked has risen by 20% since 2011, because 18 to 24-year-olds are choosing not to.Last year, across Britain, 17.8% of people in this age bracket said they were smokers.In 2011 more than a quarter of young adults said they smoked.This is the biggest drop in smokers out of any age group.Ms Arnott put this down to banning tobacco advertising.\u0026#8220The brightly coloured pack displays we used to have in shops disappeared completely in 2015 and the packs they see nowadays are a sludgy green colour, with large picture warnings, rather than the brightly coloured, highly branded packs we used to have.\u0026#8220Is it any wonder young people today increasingly choose not to smoke. It\u0026#8217s much less cool than it used to be.\u0026#8221This has been helped by the rise of e-cigarettes.The ONS estimates there are 2.8 million vapers in Britain, and almost half said their reason for taking it up was to stop smoking.Commenting on the figures, Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: \u0026#8220Smoking rates have dropped by almost a quarter in five years, a triumphant step in eliminating the nation\u0026#8217s biggest killer.\u0026#8220The data shows we are winning the war on tobacco and that we are tantalisingly close to creating the first-ever smoke-free generation in England.\u0026#8220But that war will only be won if we make more progress in helping people from deprived areas and people suffering from poor mental health, where we know smoking rates remain stubbornly high.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc51a376d-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people asda ace jim checks out for the last time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAsda Ace Jim Dodds has checked out of work for the last time.Jim was a war baby born in 1941 but 77 years later the former roofer is only just putting his feet up.The great-grandfather started his working life in Dundee’s jute mills before becoming a roofer.He even helped to build his future workplace at Asda Kirkton more than 40 years ago.Jim and his wife Patricia, of Whitfield, have four daughters and two sons.Their family also now includes 15 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.One of Jim’s daughters, Debbie, even followed in his footsteps when she also became an Asda Ace and went on to work on the checkouts.Jim spent 15 years as an Asda Ace and for the last few years has been responsible for keeping the bakery and deli in tip-top condition.Samantha Will, community champion at Asda Kirkton, organised a special retirement lunch for the much-loved colleague.Jim was given a new set of wheels – in the shape of an inflatable walking frame.Debbie said: “My dad doesn’t actually want to give up work but it is time for him to go.“He was surprised by the retirement lunch – he didn’t think they were going to do anything for him.“My dad has never been unemployed.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We are not finished with the recruitment.“We’ve got Adam Barton now and we need definitely one player more in the central defence and also a striker.”Barton signed up on a two-year deal from Partick Thistle, who agreed to cancel his contract and let him head for United as part of the cost-cutting process they’ve implemented in the wake of relegation from the Premiership.That left Csaba delighted to snatch a player from an outfit who could be among his big rivals in the league campaign.“I am very happy that Adam has made the decision to come to us because he is a player who can play in central midfield and also in the centre of the defence.”Meanwhile, United pair James Keatings and Paul McMullan have been linked with moves away.Former club Hamilton are reported to be keen on Keatings, while Partick Thistle are said to want former Celtic wide man McMullan at Firhill.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44857272341-e1531222515578-803x564.jpg ","title":"fans given chance to say last goodbye to dundee legend alan gilzean as casket laid in dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans are being invited to pay their last respects to club legend Alan Gilzean ahead of his funeral.The ceremony will take place at Dundee Crematorium on Friday at 12.30pm, with close family and friends invited.Ahead of the ceremony, \u0026#8216Gillie\u0026#8217s\u0026#8217 family have allowed Dees a chance to say goodbye to the man who was part of the 1962 league winning side.His casket will be laid in the Alan Gilzean lounge within Dens Park tonight from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.Supporters looking to go along can enter the stadium through the Main Door beside the reception.On Friday Alan\u0026#8217s body will pass Dens Park one last time around 11.55am as the funeral cortege goes down the Provost Road.It will also pass Dens Road, Strathmartine Road, Clepington Road, McAlpine Road before making its way to the crematorium.Supporters are again invited to pay their respects along the route.Alan Gilzean made 190 appearances for Dundee and scored a remarkable 169 goals, making him to this day the side’s all-time top scorer.After his seven years in the Dark Blue of Dundee he moved to Tottenham where he also became a legend.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former celtic man toshney completes move from dundee united to arbroath","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Lewis Toshney has completed a loan move to Arbroath.The versatile defender has joined the Lichties until January.The 26-year-old Dundonian, who began his career at Celtic,  has also played for Ross County, Cowdenbeath and Raith Rovers as well as having loan spells at Kilmarnock and Dundee.Toshney, who has represented Scotland at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 levels, joined Dundee United from Raith Rovers and made his debut at Arbroath\u0026#8217s Gayfield ground in the Betfred Cup in July 2016.He was absent from Saturday\u0026#8217s 1-1 draw with Arbroath at Tannadice which saw the visitors win a bonus point after a 5-3 on penalty shoot out win in the opening game of  the Betfred Cup.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4c5d1fbe2e3-480x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann hails super stop from keeper jack hamilton on dundee debut","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann hailed the stopping power of new goalie Jack Hamilton as he claimed a debut clean sheet.By the end of their 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion which started their Betfred Cup campaign, the Dark Blues were cruising to victory.However, with the game at 0-0 and 1-0, the League Two side had chances to turn the game their way.Their best effort came from the head of Jason Marr shortly after half-time but his powerful effort was well saved by new boy Hamilton with the keeper up quickly again to stop the rebound.After that Sofien Moussa added his second of the game before debutant Jean Mendy and Craig Wighton goals capped a good start to the season for Dundee.Boss Neil said: “I’m delighted, absolutely delighted.“I said before the game that this was the season started for real now, there’s no more warm-ups.“First of all, you want to win the game and then, afterwards, put on a bit of a show and score some goals so I’m pleased we did that.“Stirling made it really difficult at times and it took a brilliant double stop from big Jack Hamilton, which is exactly why we brought him to the club. When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace. He’s going to be great and he’s physically able to deal with the game here. Karl came on and showed glimpses as well.

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass. They are loving it and enjoying the peace and quiet.\"Others have used it as a thoroughfare as part of their daily commute while the Northern Constabulary Pipe Band also took the opportunity to hold its rehearsals in the park one evening.The idea of a community buyout is being driven by the Northern Counties Cricket Club, one of the park\u0027s main users.Mr Ford, who is a club member, believes such a move will be good for the club, the community and Inverness \u0026ndash and the buildings which are deteriorating.\"Without investing time and money, they could be mothballed and if that happens, we would not be able to use the park,\" he said.\"To me, a community buyout is common sense.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:34

I still live in the area, I’m based in the area, being out of the game I still follow Burnley as well.“We bump into each other quite a lot because we’re part of the League Managers’ Association. He knows how close Burnley is to my heart and I’ve always encouraged what he’s doing – not that he needs my encouragement!“It’s nice that we can talk on a level about Burnley and it pleases me that he is really prospering.“Sean’s had his ups and downs in the early part of his managerial career and he comes to Burnley and has managed to find the right club at the right time for him.“Now he has good control of the football club which is unusual in the modern game.“The people at the club and him listen to each other and they work well together.“They’ve backed him and it’s paid dividends.”Phelan worked with Pittodrie gaffer McInnes at Stockport when the latter was on loan at the Hatters from Rangers in 1998.McInnes has revitalised the Dons during his time in the Granite City.In five seasons in charge they have finished second in the Scottish Premiership four times and third once.In 2014 he guided Aberdeen to the League Cup, the first silverware won by the club since 1995.Phelan has been impressed by the job McInnes has done and added: “I know Derek quite well because he played when I was an assistant manager at Stockport County.“He’s done exceptionally well and he wants to push on because he’s had interest from other clubs and knocked it back.“He feels he has stability there which is great to hear.“They are both pushing on and improving these clubs. Dyche is probably a step ahead but Derek is not far away from him.“It’s nice to know in football that there are still places where a manager can go, put something together and achieve something.“If people have some success at a club they tend to stay for longer than those that don’t.“I’m really pleased for Derek and what he’s done.“It’s about the culture you are trying to create and produce as well on top of results.“He’s had the opportunity to do that and other clubs have tried to take him so he obviously feels that he is comfortable and has an understanding with people and appreciates that.“That is quite nice to know when football can be a very hit or miss and a dismissive game for coaches and managers.“It’s easy to be a bad manager when you lose three games in a row.“Derek has stuck at it and people have stuck with him which is refreshing.”During his brief time working with McInnes Phelan says it was clear to see he had a good footballing brain.And he is pleased to see he has carried that into his managerial career – although he does admit at the time there were no clear signs McInnes would go on to a success in management.Phelan said: “It would be easy in hindsight to say yes, but when you’re a player you concentrate on playing.“He must have seen it as the next best thing to playing and then after that it’s about getting an opportunity.“He had a footballing brain and was a good player and obviously observed a lot of what was going on around him in coaching and management.“He has taken that on and fair play to him for doing that.”Phelan has joined Central Coast Mariners as a sporting director, his first job since leaving then Premier League outfit Hull City in January 2017.But to keep himself occupied during the interim period along with some business partners he has set up Sensible Soccer which offers a variety of coaching services.Phelan has enjoyed that work but his desire was always to get back into the game.He said: “I just wanted to get around people who wanted me to take a coaching session and it’s just developed quite organically.“Universities have started to ask me to do some days here and there with sports students and get out on the training ground.“In the main we’ve been offering coaching services and consultancy which is going down well.“It gave me something to do.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen mums shock after man tries to lure boys into car1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mum of an Aberdeen schoolboy who was targeted by a man while he played with a friend in a park has told of her shock and anger.Police have launched an investigation into the incident on Aberdeen’s Springhill Road – which is the third stranger danger incident in the city in the space of a week.Speaking to The Evening Express, the mum, who did not want to be named, said the man approached the pair next to Kingsford School on Saturday afternoon and “aggressively” told them to come into his car.She said the pair ran away and the man’s black Mercedes appeared to follow them before speeding off.She said: “Initially I was shocked and angry that someone had approached my son and his friend in this manner and went to the school to see if I could find this man to see what he was up to.

I haven’t seen him around, I haven’t met him yet. But I’d say, play as many practice rounds with terrific players as you can.“Guys you can probably learn from and see how they go about their business.“Just ask as many questions as possible, that’ll be a great opportunity to get some insight.“On the golf course, I’m sure he’s obviously a very good player, to be here.“Believe in yourself and, if there’s an opportunity to get on the leaderboard, it’ll be a great experience.“Go hoping for the Cinderella story. It’s possible, we’ve always seen an amateur do well at some points during the week.“Hopefully it can be Sam.”Locke, 19, who is mentored by and works for 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie, made it into this week’s field through final qualifying, as he attempts to carve out a career for himself in golf.He might be two years older than Rose was when he won the silver medal for leading amateur at Birkdale, but he’s a year younger than 14-time major champion Tiger Woods when he won the medal in 1996.Woods made his major debut the year before at the 1995 Masters.Locke said: “I didn’t know that about Tiger, to be honest. But, again, you go into an event to play the best you can.“At the same time, it’s nice to know a player like that played his first major at the same age as me.“Hopefully if I just keep working hard, playing the best I can, and keep on improving, you never know where it could get you.”Locke will play tomorrow and Friday with American Brandt Snedeker and Australian Cameron Davis, and how he performs will decide whether or not he turns pro.He said: “It depends how I do. I’ve played in a couple of pro events before but nothing of this magnitude.“We’ll see. It’s obviously going to be a really enjoyable week, but it depends how I play – that’ll make my decision.”For the moment, the young north-east hope is just preparing as best he can for what many consider the toughest test in Links golf.Lawrie is at the Open as mentor, but also fulfilling sponsorship commitments and media work, sharing the expertise which saw him bring the Claret Jug back to Aberdeen.Locke said: “Obviously to have any major champion helping you is great.“It’s a bonus he’s won the Open at the course it’s being played. I don’t know how it played in 1999 compared to how it’s going to play this year.“It’s the same lay-out, but to have him helping will be great.”He added: “You prepare for any weather. With links golf more than inland golf, the weather can change quicker.“But you’ve got to prepare for whatever mother nature brings, so you just deal with it and go there ready.“If it stays nice, it’s better to play in but, at the end of the day, we’re all still playing on the same day.“I’m just trying to prepare as I would for another event.“Yes I’m excited, but I’m there to try to play the best I can. So I’m preparing in the normal way and we’ll see what we can do.“Obviously, the best players in the world are in the tournament.“If I play really well, I could be paired with other guys who are playing well at the same time (for the weekend).“Whether that’s any of the top-ranked players in the world, you don’t know, but all these guys are playing in a major championship and they’re all really, really good.“I’m not too bothered who I get.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

On a lovely summer evening the rafters of Strachur Memorial Hall dirled to the sound of pipers showing off skills learned during the week in front of proud family members. John Kelly of Dunoon performed his master of ceremony duties with his usual wit and dexterity.An award, presented by his family in memory of the late Niall Campbell, is presented each year to the pupil who has shown the biggest improvement in the eyes of the tutors. From a shortlist of six young players, this year\u0026#8217s recipient of the Niall Campbell trophy was Mid Argyll\u0026#8217s own Camron MacPhail.Strachur and District Piping Association made another surprise award this year for services to the piping school. Association chairman Colin Stevenson made the presentation to Allan McLean of Kilmartin for his support over two decades. Not only has he driven mini buses to allow children from Mid Argyll to attend but he has offered a helping hand in many different aspects over the years.Winding up another successful week as the concert concluded, Mr Stevenson thanked parents, pupils and all the tutors for their support, while acknowledging the hard work of committee members and everyone who helps.PIC:Alastair McLean performs a Gaelic song to add a little variety. 06_a28PipingSchool01The success of Mid Argyll Pipe Band was celebrated as a group of band members performed on stage. 06_a28PipingSchool02The inimitable piping tutor Annie Grant, right, was assisted in her intermediate piping group by Alastair MacLean, left. 06_a28PipingSchool04Camron MacPhail was presented with his trophy by Jamie Campbell, a grandson of the late Pipe Major Niall Campbell. 06_a28PipingSchool06There was a surprise for Allan McLean when he was presented with a gift to recognise his contribution to the piping school over many years.

We thank road users for their patience in advance and encourage them to plan ahead by checking the Traffic Scotland website for real-time journey information.’Real-time journey planning information can be obtained by visiting www.trafficscotland.org or twitter @trafficscotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles hammer home a win against caberfeidh","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowMarine Harvest PremiershipKyles Athletic returned to Tighnabruaich for the first time this season and they marked the occasion with a 5-1 win over Caberfeidh.Kyles Athletic boss James Perlich was still without the injured Roddy MacDonald, while Andrew King completed a two-match suspension. His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shetland comes to cairndow","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFilm crews were once again spotted in Argyll with the cast of famed BBC series Shetland hot on their heels.After the excitement of Love me to Death filming in Inveraray and Lochgilphead last month, Silverprint Pictures’ made its way to Cairndow to film Shetland\u0026#8217s fifth series this week.The series, which has previously aired on BBC 1, is a dramatisation of the murder mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.Shooting took place on Ardkinglas Estate, inside and outside Ardkinglas House.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strone point roadworks are completed","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA £1.6m project to improve road safety on the A83 at Strone Point at Inveraray has been completed.Around 370m of carriageway has been realigned and a section of the hillside scaled back, widening the road and improving driver visibility.Drainage systems have been upgraded to improve resilience in wet conditions, and new safety barriers and bike guards have also been installed.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: ‘The section of the A83 at Strone Point on Loch Fyne is single carriageway with a history of fatal and serious accidents.

The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Pupils had a kicking time as they took part in football challenges ranging from beat the goalie to foot bowl – football’s equivalent of 10 pin bowling.  And, of course, the youngsters enjoyed being pictured with Ayr’s own sporty star Michael, who brought along the League 1 trophy.

Scarlett is a member of the Glasgow-based UK Theatre School which works with a string of casting directors to showcase its students’ talents. She was one of those selected to appear before the casting directors working on the new Legoland theme park TV and cinema advertisement. Having landed a part, she was cast as an excited youngster exploring the park in the advert. Scarlett, who is a pupil at Troon Primary, had to travel to London for a full day filming session. The theme of the new Legoland campaign focuses on their ‘Deep Sea Adventure’ and Scarlett is seen on board a submarine exploring the ocean and seeing Lego sea creatures swimming around. Scarlett said: “It was a really exciting experience to be involved with the production and I had such a great time. It’s amazing now to see the ad now that it’s finished.” Her proud mum Tracey said: “We were grateful to the UKTS scheme who worked with Scarlett. She absolutely loved the whole experience.” UKTS principal Lizanne Lambie Thomson said: “All our students have the chance to sign up to our own exclusive in-house castings agency. Our team works with casting directors and producers from the world of TV, radio, cinema and advertising and regularly approach us for casting candidates. “We’ve had students in big campaigns for big brands such as RBS, Legoland, Skoda and Aldi, to name but a few. The involvement gives our students an amazing insight into the behind the scenes production of ads as well as TV programmes, radio shows and movies. We’ve had our students appear alongside real Hollywood big stars such as Rihanna, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Firth as well as music artistes including Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Michael Buble. This amazing Legoland project was a lot of fun to be involved with and even more fun for Scarlett as she’s now starring in it! We’re all very proud of her achievement in securing the part.” The UK Theatre School is based in Glasgow’s West Regent Street and has around 700 students.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonAyr NewsGlasgow"},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

\u0026ldquochange gear in how it deals with Brexit.\nThe Taoiseach said it will be an \u0026ldquoenormous challenge dealing with the change in trade between Ireland and Britain.\nThe Irish cabinet has been discussing ways to step up preparations for a hard Brexit.\nLeo Varadkar speaks to the media at Derrynane House (Brian Lawless/PA)\nAs part of this, the Irish government plans to hire 1,000 customs officers and veterinary inspectors at its ports and airports over the next year.\nMr Varadkar said that with Brexit eight months away, growing uncertainty looms over whether it will be possible to get a withdrawal agreement through Westminster.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to change the gear and up our preparations when it comes to Brexit, he said.\nMr Varadkar said this involves communicating with the public and preparing ports and airports.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoWe are preparing for a change in the rules of trade between Britain and Ireland in January 2021.\n\u0026ldquoIn the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit next March, of course it won\u0026rsquot be possible to have 1,000 people in place by then but we will make contingency arrangements to do whatever needs to be done in the unlikely event that should arise.\nIn a special Brexit meeting at Derrynane House in Co Kerry, Mr Varadkar and his ministers thrashed out Brexit plans at the ancestral home of Irish political leader Daniel O\u0026rsquoConnell.\nDuring the cabinet away day, ministers discussed Brexit contingency plans to prepare for a hard Brexit.\nThe cabinet met at Derrynane House (Brian Lawless/PA)\nDerrynane House, which is now a museum dedicated to the life of the famous politician who was instrumental in fighting for the rights of Irish people in the 19th century, was selected as the picturesque location for the round-table talks on mounting Brexit issues.\nA number of controversial amendments were passed by the UK Government earlier this week.\nOne amendment has made it unlawful for Northern Ireland to form a separate customs union from the rest of the UK.\nThis goes against the EU\u0026rsquos backstop proposal which would see Northern Ireland treated as part of the EU customs union.\nThe meeting in Co Kerry, which lasted five hours, discussed a range of Brexit matters following the events in Westminster.\nMr Varadkar said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove done a lot of preparations already, the public finances are in good order, I know some people are telling me we shouldn\u0026rsquot set up a rainy day fund and that we shouldn\u0026rsquot go about balancing the books, but if we do run into trouble over the next couple of years, it will be because of Brexit.\n\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why it makes sense to have a rainy day fund, it makes sense to balance the books, that if the proverbial hits the fan that we won\u0026rsquot find ourselves where we were 10 years ago, that we will have a rainy day fund and that the public finances will be in order and that we don\u0026rsquot have to do the kind of things we did 10 years ago \u0026ndash raising taxes, cutting pay, cutting spending.\n\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll be in a much better place to

Robertson, who had the energetic assistance of a most representative and capable committee of boat-owners and band of other devoted workers, the appeal made to the public for a full measure of that liberal support for which this locality has earned a name which is second to none struck a most responsive chord, with the result that the large hall was crowded to the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kitchen firm cooks up charity cash","story":"Recently Raymond Harvey of the Campbeltown Christmas lights group on left and Lewis MacKay from Castlehill primary football collected cheques from Howden\u0026#8217s manager Archie Martin centre. 25_c28howdens01_RaymondHarvey_ArchieMartin_LewisMackay\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"simple pleasures of working outside in good weather","story":"NFU president Andrew McCornick said: \u0026#8216This year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year’s difficult harvest.\u0026#8216The recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members.\u0026#8216After suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather they have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.\u0026#8216The quality of winter fodder made to date is likely to be tremendous.\u0026#8216I am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity.\u0026#8216That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain.

Your Safety. Your Choice.\u0026#8217The Royal Highland Education Trust (RHET) addressed the importance of getting children on farms to find out where their food comes from and that, with the right planning and precautions, they can be safe, fun and educational places.Carole Brunton, farmer and RHET Fife CI project coordinator, is in charge of organising farm visits throughout Fife, making sure that the farms, teachers and children are all ready for a fun, safe and educational experience.Her top tip for having children on farms is: \u0026#8216Common sense and plenty of planning.\u0026#8217Carole said: \u0026#8216For us, farm safety is extremely important. For the children’s safety, for the farmer’s reputation, and for RHET because if we had one accident on one farm it would stop all farm visits. We don’t want that to happen, so we have a strict regime.\u0026#8216We have a risk assessment process that we go through which we do with the farmer before the children are anywhere near the farm. Then we do a pre-visit with the teacher.\u0026#8216We go out with the teacher and the farmer and we do a pre-visit so that everyone knows what’s going to happen on the day when the children arrive.\u0026#8216On the day of the visit the farmer will make sure there’s no dangerous machinery sitting out or there’s not a hole being dug near to where we’ll be. We work closely with the host to make the site as safe as possible.\u0026#8216I would say common sense and supervision are the main things for any farm visit. We don’t want to make it all rules and regulations, so they can’t enjoy themselves. But there must be an element of control. We do tend to let them enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun because that’s the best way for them to learn.\u0026#8216We have a plan for every visit before we turn up, we have a plan of what we are going to do and where we’re going to take them.\u0026#8216Before leaving the farm they wash their hands with antibacterial soap, running water and paper towels, so there’s no contamination.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

Additionally, the four boys have pledged to get their legs waxed if they hit \u0026pound800.  And Callum said that they had not been doing any additional training before they attempt to take on the 1,345-metre ascent. He said: \u0026ldquoWe haven\u0026rsquot been doing any specific hiking training, just lots of rounds of drilling, rolling and sparring to keep us in tip top shape for the challenge.

More than 100 giant worker bee sculptures, each decorated with its own unique design, will form the Bee In The City trail in various locations for nine weeks between July 23 and September 23.  Sculptures include a Rock \u0026lsquoN\u0026rsquo Roll Bee designed in partnership with ex-Oasis star Liam Gallagher, a Hac-Bee-Enda bee celebrating the city\u0026rsquos legendary nightclub, a bee honouring one of TV soap Coronation Street\u0026rsquos most iconic characters, Hilda Bugden, plus footballing tributes to Manchester\u0026rsquos famous clubs Bee United and Mike Summer-Bee.  The Bee Live in MCR sculpture features signatures from the Rolling Stones, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift, while the I Wanna Bee Adored sculpture is signed by Stone Roses bassist Gary \u0026ldquoMani Mountfield.  Sally-Ann Wilkinson, director of organisers Wild in Art, said: \u0026ldquoBee In The City is a celebration of Manchester\u0026rsquos diversity, creativity and culture.  \u0026ldquoEach individual Bee represents our fantastic city\u0026rsquos many achievements, from its legendary music scene to scientific discoveries and industrial heritage.  \u0026ldquoManchester is such a unique city in many ways, and one of those is its ability to bring people together.  \u0026ldquoDifferent sectors have collaborated to create this fabulous event, including the public and private sectors, schools and community groups.  \u0026ldquoAs well as a celebration of creativity, the trail is also a celebration of unity.  Councillor Luthfur Rahman, Manchester City Council\u0026rsquos executive member of schools, culture and leisure, said: \u0026ldquoThe council is delighted to support Bee In The City and would like to congratulate everyone who has taken part and contributed to this extraordinary event. Manchester is known the world over for its innovation and creativity and it\u0026rsquos great to see this in action.  \u0026ldquoThe trail and its associated activities are free of charge, accessible, and provide plenty of opportunities for people to get involved.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThe event also has an important part to play in helping ensure the health and well-being of all those who follow the trail and is\u0026nbspset to give hours of entertainment to thousands of residents and visitors\u0026nbspthis summer.

The Irish cabinet has been discussing ways to step up preparations for a hard Brexit.  As part of this, the Irish government plans to hire 1,000 customs officers and veterinary inspectors at its ports and airports over the next year.  Mr Varadkar said that with Brexit eight months away, growing uncertainty looms over whether it will be possible to get a withdrawal agreement through Westminster.  \u0026ldquoWe need to change the gear and up our preparations when it comes to Brexit, he said.  Mr Varadkar said this involves communicating with the public and preparing ports and airports.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are preparing for a change in the rules of trade between Britain and Ireland in January 2021.  \u0026ldquoIn the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit next March, of course it won\u0026rsquot be possible to have 1,000 people in place by then but we will make contingency arrangements to do whatever needs to be done in the unlikely event that should arise.  In a special Brexit meeting at Derrynane House in Co Kerry, Mr Varadkar and his ministers thrashed out Brexit plans at the ancestral home of Irish political leader Daniel O\u0026rsquoConnell.  During the cabinet away day, ministers discussed Brexit contingency plans to prepare for a hard Brexit.  Derrynane House, which is now a museum dedicated to the life of the famous politician who was instrumental in fighting for the rights of Irish people in the 19th century, was selected as the picturesque location for the round-table talks on mounting Brexit issues.  A number of controversial amendments were passed by the UK Government earlier this week.  One amendment has made it unlawful for Northern Ireland to form a separate customs union from the rest of the UK.  This goes against the EU\u0026rsquos backstop proposal which would see Northern Ireland treated as part of the EU customs union.  The meeting in Co Kerry, which lasted five hours, discussed a range of Brexit matters following the events in Westminster.  Mr Varadkar said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove done a lot of preparations already, the public finances are in good order, I know some people are telling me we shouldn\u0026rsquot set up a rainy day fund and that we shouldn\u0026rsquot go about balancing the books, but if we do run into trouble over the next couple of years, it will be because of Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why it makes sense to have a rainy day fund, it makes sense to balance the books, that if the proverbial hits the fan that we won\u0026rsquot find ourselves where we were 10 years ago, that we will have a rainy day fund and that the public finances will be in order and that we don\u0026rsquot have to do the kind of things we did 10 years ago \u0026ndash raising taxes, cutting pay, cutting spending.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll be in a much better place to deal with any shock that may arise and an obvious place to which that shock could arise would be a disorderly Brexit."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8067002.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-nine-hidden-gems-in-argyll-and-bute","story":"  Paddle Steamer Waverley  Join Waverley this summer for a magical journey.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

According the Balornock church\u0027s website, the service was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \u0026ldquocelebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.  But last night Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University, held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTI event.  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.

Jordan added: \"We are concerned about the message that this could send to the young people of Glasgow Caledonian University, and so would like to stress that these predictable voices of opposition are becoming increasingly drowned out by a Catholic and wider faith community which is supportive of LGBT equality.  \"There were many people of faith who attended the Parade this weekend and in our efforts to advance LGBT-inclusive education in schools, we have been strongly supported by numerous Catholic Priests and their parishioners, as well as Church of Scotland and Scottish Episcopal Church ministers.  \"Our experience working with the Scottish Catholic Education Service as part of the Scottish Government\u0027s LGBT Inclusive Education Working Group has also been nothing but positive and productive.  \"We know that those who support the LGBT community outweigh those who endorse intolerance and I imagine that the number of attendees to this service in contrast with those who attended the Pride parade would further prove that.\"  Glasgow Caledonian University and the Catholic Church in Glasgow have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8083985.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ghosts-have-a-dispiriting-effect-on-home-values-finds-study","story":"  At least that is the claim of a new study which reveals that supposedly haunted houses are having thousands of pounds wiped off their value the moment they are investigated for paranormal activity.  Statistician Dr Geoff Ellis said his study into 25 British \"haunted houses\", sold over the last half-century, revealed they lost an average of 17 per cent off their value compared with the sale prices of similar homes nearby.  What was said to be Scotland\u0027s most haunted house lay empty for decades before it was finally sold.  The eerie 18th century home, called Windhouse, nestled in the centre of a tiny island nature reserve, had only one permanent resident since the 1920s - a ghostly apparition known as the \"lady in silk\".    Legend had it the haunting was the result of one event, in the 19th century. The house\u0027s then-owner, a man called Harrison, decided that sheep would be more profitable than people and evicted his tenants in a mini Highland clearance.  One old lady, forced from her home, is said to have cursed Windhouse and everyone who would ever live in it.  Ghostly inhabitants have since included a lady dressed in silk who is believed to be the spirit of a woman whose skeleton was found under floorboards of the main stairs.  So called because of the rustling sound of her dress and petticoats, the ghoul was said to walk three times in a circle at the top of a flight of stairs, give a sigh, and then disappear.    The Grade-C listed home on Yell, Shetland which was first built in 1707 and then rebuilt in 1880, was eventually bought in 2003 by the couple from Cheshire who fell in love with the place and planned to renovate the castellated house. But it fell through.  Twelve years later the building which is on Historic Environment Scotland\u0027s buildings at risk register was put back on the market, with offers above \u0026pound25,000 and prospective purchasers were advised not to enter the site because of the building\u0027s extremely dangerous condition.  Dr Ellis\u0027s research suggests having a haunted house would knock almost \u0026pound40,000 off the average UK property price when it came to selling it.  A separate survey of 2,000 Britons found nearly one in four believed their houses were haunted, while 55% said they would be put off buying a haunted house.  The study, believed to be the first in the world looking at paranormal property, was commissioned by TV channel Really to mark the new series of Help! My House Is Haunted.    Barri Ghai, Sandy Lakdar and Chris Fleming from Help! My House is Haunted on Really  Adam Collings, Really channel director said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos staggering how much money could be wiped-off the value of your property, should you feel your house is haunted and eye-opening to see just how many of us have experienced spooky goings-on at home.  \"The research suggests it\u0026rsquos probably a good idea to keep your eyes peeled for paranormal activity when viewing a property, as your new house could become a very bad investment when you come to sell it, should it be found to be haunted.  The gloomy findings also found that well over half of the Scottish respondents (61%) say they\u0026rsquod be put off buying a haunted house, whilst 27% of property buyers have felt a spooky presence when viewing a house, which has put them off buying.  It certainly did not appear to put off Prince Charles who bought Dumfries House, a then dilapidated 18th century Scottish mansion that he saved for the nation at the 11th hour, 11 years ago.  It was put on the market and its contents were already on their way to an auction house ready to be sold off. But a group convened by the prince secured the property and its furniture for \u0026pound45m, with \u0026pound20m personally guaranteed by Charles himself.    The Duchess of Cornwall recently admitted that a visit to the rundown mansion soon after its purchase left her spooked and that she was unable to enter for several years after being convinced it was haunted.  \"It had a really eerie feel about it,\" she said. \"There was definitely a ghost. Without a shadow of a doubt. I remember the first time I walked up the steps, got into the hall and I thought I can\u0027t go any further. I literally froze. If my hair could stand on end, it would have done.  \"I remember leaving and thinking I don\u0027t want to come back here again and I didn\u0027t for a few years.\"  Camilla would later become more accustomed to the house\u0027s idiosyncrasies .  Given the survey results, it was perhaps unsurprising to find that eight in ten Scots (80%) polled said they would lie to their estate agent to cover up the fact their house was haunted to avoid the financial consequences."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-at-reservoir-after-reports-a-teenager-was-in-the-water","story":"  Emergency vehicles were sent to Glenburn Reservoir near Paisley after the alarm was raised at about 17:35.

A wide-ranging study of the nation\u0027s telly time has revealed that the over-55s have claimed the crown as the chieftain of the couch potato race, spending almost four times as much watching broadcasts compared to their offspring.  Last year, those heading for retirement age spent and nearly six hours a day transfixed by their living room screen, compared to just an hour and a half for those aged between 4 and 15.  And while the number of minutes whiled away by the older generation watching soaps, dramas and documentaries has fallen in recent years, it is still almost two hours greater than the national average of nearly four hours a day uncovered by Ofcom\u0027s first Media Nations Scotland report.  Overall, Scots watch more TV than people living in other parts of the UK, the report said, with viewers north of the border spending a daily average of three hours and 46 minutes in front of their sets - 24 minutes more than the UK average of three hours and 23 minutes.    And they are watching a wide range of programmes. The report delved into the most popular shows last year and found that terrestrial TV is still pulling in audiences in the millions.  It helps to go big \u0027event\u0027 TV, such as the final of Strictly Come Dancing the Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys Christmas special, pulled in the most viewers as did reality shows I\u0027m a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here! and Britain\u0027s Got Talent.  But there was also a place for \u0027quality\u0027 television, with the ten-years-in-the-making series Blue Planet II and big-budget dramas Broadchurch and The Moorside also proving to be hits with the audience.  The Strictly final was the most-viewed broadcast programme on television across Scotland in 2017, with more than 1.1 million viewers tuning in to watch Scottish actor and Former Holby City star Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones lift the glitterball trophy.  Other hits for the year included the BBC\u0027s long-running Hogmanay show and its football-related stablemate Only and Excuse, Emmerdale, Coronation Street and Sherlock.  The BBC and ITV dominated terrestrial viewing habits, sharing all slots in a top-20 league table of the\u0026nbsp nation\u0027s most-watched programmes between them.  Yet while both channels remain strong, Ofcom found that people are slowly turning their backs on traditional TV.  On average, Scots are tuning in for 46 fewer minutes each day than they did eight years ago, and the decline is even steeper among children.  Youngsters have cut the amount of TV they consume each day by an hour - and the trend is accelerating.  But while people in Scotland are watching less broadcast television, they are spending more time watching other things such as online streaming on their TV set.    Daily viewing of non-broadcast content, such as YouTube and subscription on-demand services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, increased to 40 minutes.  BBC iPlayer was the most popular on-demand/streaming service among adults in Scotland in January 2018, with almost half saying they used it, followed by Netflix and the STV Player.  The report found the use of Netflix is \"heavily skewed towards younger viewers\".  While a third of adults in Scotland claim to use the service at least once a week, the number doubles among 16-24-year-olds while half of\u0026nbsp 25-34s say they use it.  But the service, which relies on an understanding of new technology, has not been taken up by baby boomers - with fewer than one in ten saying they tuned in.  The report said that the BBC, STV and ITV spent a combined \u0026pound53.9m on first-run, UK-made programmes for viewers in Scotland, an 8 per cet real-terms decrease year-on-year.  It said this decline was the result of lower spending by the BBC, down by 10 per cent year on year, while STV/ITV spending remained broadly stable.  The report also examined trends in the radio and audio sectors and found the amount of time people spent listening to digital radio has continued to grow, with two thirds of Scots now owning one.\u0026nbsp Almost nine in ten (88%) of adults listen to the radio every week.  On average, adults in Scotland spend 14 hours four minutes each week listening to any type of audio, the majority of it live radio.  Glenn Preston, Ofcom\u0027s Scotland Director, said: \"Today\u0027s research shows that the way people in Scotland watch TV is changing rapidly.  \"Although viewers in Scotland watch more TV than in the rest of the UK, they are spending less time watching \u0027traditional\u0027 broadcast TV and are turning to online streaming services, attracted by their exclusive programmes and vast libraries of classic shows.  \"Broadcasters in Scotland must confront the challenges posed by both online streaming companies and the changing way people are watching television, to ensure they continue to make great shows to appeal to Scottish viewers in the digital age.\""},{"url":null,"title":"so-scots-and-londoners-are-different-think-again","story":"  That is because a major new analysis of Britain\u0026rsquos most robust social attitudes survey shows that the UK capital shares more values with Scotland than with its own hinterland.  The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) found Scots and Londoners were the most left-wing and liberal Britons with more in common with each other than with Wales and provincial England.  The new work overturns long-standing assumptions on both sides of the Border that Scotland has more cultural and political affinity with the north of England than the south.  Some 60 per cent of Scots identify as left-wing, compared with 58% of Londoners and just 51% of Northerners. But Londoners and Scots were also the most likely to back tax-and-spend policies and sympathise with people on welfare.  Neil Smith, research director at Natcen, said: \u0026ldquoWhile there are clear distinctions in the way Londoners think about certain social and political issues, in quite a few instances \u0026ndash despite the geographical distance and the different make-ups of our populations \u0026ndash Londoners share more in common with the Scots than with their regional neighbours. Both are more likely to be engaged in politics, have the greatest proportion of left-affiliated individuals, are more likely to fall on the pro-welfare end of the scale, and are most inclined to sympathise with benefit claimants.  The survey comes two years after Scotland and London emerged as the only two \u0026ldquoregions of the island of Britain to oppose Brexit.  London has become a stronghold for Labour in southern England. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, shares the distinction with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being \u0026ndash reports suggest \u0026ndash- despised by America\u0026rsquos populist right president.  Similar social attitudes may also reflect the rarely acknowledged reality that Scotland, collectively, has higher living standards and economic activity than anywhere in the UK bar London and the south-east.  The analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey carried out by NatCen, and considered one of the best snap shots of what people think.  It was commissioned by Trust for London, a charity and think- tank. The Trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, Bharat Mehta, stressed what he saw as common values across the UK.  He said: \u0026ldquoPart of the story is the striking similarities between the attitudes of Londoners and those of Scots. The other part, is how on important issues like equality, education and public spending, Londoners hold comparable views to everyone else."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-guitarist-brian-may-to-celebrate-work-of-victorian-royal-photographer","story":"  George Washington Wilson, from Aberdeen, spearheaded a form of 3D imagery which captured the imagination of the musician a century later.

Concerns have previously been raised over the decline in the proportion of medical school places taken up by Scottish students compared to those from the rest of the UK and overseas, who are required to pay tuition fees.  Previous research has shown that Scottish students accounted for 63 per cent of the 1999/2000 intake for clinical medicine at Scotland\u0027s medical schools, but now make up around 50 per cent.  It has led to warnings that unless the share of medical school places allocated to Scots is increased, NHS Scotland will increasingly struggle to retain young doctors after their training is complete.  Evidence shows that Scottish-born doctors are statistically more likely to remain in Scotland after qualifying than those from the rest of the UK or abroad.  Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary Miles Briggs said: \u0026ldquoIf the SNP had maintained levels since coming to power, hundreds more young Scottish people would have had the opportunity to study medicine.  \u0026ldquoThis would have gone some way to solving the GP crisis we are currently facing across the country, not to mention some specific shortages in other areas.

Named as Fishing News 2017 ‘Port of the Year’ Peterhead Port handled a record £195million worth of fish during 2017. The port is currently undergoing a £51 million investment and opened the UK’s biggest fish market in June, landing a huge sale of 5,990 boxes on opening day.                                                     Nearby Fraserburgh Harbour, also an important fishing port, has been diversifying, recently being announced as the preferred port for the Moray Offshore Renewable scheme as a base for operation and maintenance of renewable projects being developed in the Moray Firth.                                                     The Council worked with the harbour to support its bid and roads and transportation teams are continuing to provide logistical support as necessary to both Fraserburgh and Peterhead ports.        Global energy firm Equinor and its partner Masdar recently unveiled their Batwind project in Peterhead, for the first time making it possible to store energy produced from an offshore wind farm.Electricity produced at the world’s first floating offshore wind farm, Hywind Scotland, located 25km off the coast of Peterhead, will be transported via cables to an onshore substation where 1 MW batteries are placed and connected to the grid. The battery capacity is the equivalent of more than 128,000 iPhones.As the wind isn’t always blowing, energy storage technologies like batteries are expected to become increasingly important to secure grid stability as renewable energy becomes ever more significant.And in agriculture, the council’s Garioch Area Committee recently approved planning permission for an expansion of Thainstone Mart, supporting an application designed to assist the local industry’s long term future.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770159.1531902954!/image/image.jpg","title":"manish jethwa glasgow can be the uk s landmark low emission city","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The Scottish Government has unveiled plans to work with councils to introduce low-emission zones (LEZs) in Scotland\u0026#8217s four biggest cities by 2020. The objective is clear: to reduce emissions and improve air quality across Scotland.                Glasgow plans to have Scotland’s first LEZ in place by the end of this year and it will eventually result in all but the cleanest-engine vehicles being banned from the city centre. That is one key way in which the city could work towards its key goal of lowering emissions, but what else can the authorities do to achieve not just this core aim but also the wider goal of reducing air pollution?            New technology that connects a range of different infrastructure together potentially has a big role to play. The latest advances in ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) technology allow cities to connect to street lights, buildings, bridges, drainage systems and other infrastructure to monitor and analyse how they interact. This can form the foundation for local authorities’ development of smart cities or regions with reducing emissions an important part of this.            READ MORE: Fears raised that Scotland’s firs low-emission zone will have little impactLocal authorities across Scotland already have networks of automatic monitoring stations in place to capture relevant data from various points and assess air quality. Sensors can be installed on street lights above the reach of vandals but at a level low enough to measure the air people are breathing.The data collected allows councils to monitor pollution levels and then adjust their strategy around road building, transport planning and pedestrianisation, for example, both to keep emissions to a minimum and reduce the impact they have on the wider public. Power and communication can be delivered through the street infrastructure and the wider smart city network. Linked to this, cities could also look to further cut emissions by reducing the number of traffic hotspots in the areas under their control. That’s essentially about pinpointing where traffic is heaviest. The UK is currently a very congested nation. Back in 2016, analytics company Inrix monitored traffic on every road in 123 cities, including London, Glasgow, Rome and Madrid. Its analysis revealed more than 20,300 so-called “traffic hotspots” in UK cities – well over double the number in Germany and twice that of France.READ MORE: Glasgow’s Internet of Things network expandsKnowing where the main points of congestion are is half the battle. Armed with that knowledge, councils can start to mitigate the problem by introducing new approaches to traffic signalling, for example, or by enhancing communication with other road users through better signposting. Dynamic traffic forecasting is another fast-emerging technology that these Scottish cities could potentially make use of. The approach connects infrastructure assets and devices to improve mobility across cities, thereby helping to reduce the time vehicles are on the road and, by extension, minimise emissions. Sensors at parking spots could collect real-time data on parking availability and be transmitted across networks, linking with end-user and local authority devices. Traffic control cameras could be connected to the transport authority in real time, enabling them to potentially increase the frequency and duration of green lights depending on road conditions.            It’s yet another example of how the smartest Scottish cities can successfully implement low-emission zones and keep pollution levels to a minimum over the coming years by adopting the latest technology solutions to monitor and measure the current situation – and then take action.Manish Jethwa is chief technology officer at Yotta"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770682.1531933507!/image/image.jpg","title":"priest who called pride offence to god removed as university chaplain","story":"        A Catholic priest who described Glasgow Pride as a \u0026#8220gross offence to God\u0026#8221 has been removed from his role as a university chaplain.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words.

Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 18 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kilbeg-tenants.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

We may, if we have the courage, actually have a unique opportunity to create a future beyond division and sectarianism and build a dispensation that serves the interests of all the people who share this island. \nThe former South Antrim MLA also said divisions over the past can be overcome. \n\"If acceptance of a shared history remains a formidable challenge for this this generation, the concept of a share future may be a more achievable outcome,\" he said. \nHe went on to propose that a unique monument to all those killed in the conflict be built at the site of the former Long Kesh prison. \n\"I would offer one suggestion that a memorial or healing wall be established at the listed prison buildings. A sculpture, perhaps modelled on the Washington Memorial Wall, on which could be inscribed the names of every person killed as a result of the 30 years war that ended in 1998. This specially commissioned artwork would enable every victim family to visit the site and to remember and respect and would immortalise the names of all those who had died, of whatever nationality, combatants and non-combatants, those who were killed in Ireland and those who were killed elsewhere.\" \n\nMr McLaughlin also called for a question on a future referendum on Irish unity to be included in the next census, due to be carried out in the north in 2021. \n\"Perhaps the most constructive contribution that a restored Executive, on in their absence, a Secretary of State could make would be to arrange for an appropriate question to be formulated for inclusion in the 2021 census that would permit citizens to declare their support for either of the two constitutional options described in the Good Friday Agreement. \n\"The inclusion of such a question would have no constitutional effect, however the objectivity of the process and collation of responses would be essential to a decision on a referendum on Irish unity and in itself an encouragement for developing rational and thoughtful debate.\" \nConcluding, the veteran republican said now is the time for political leadership. \n\"Clear and affirmative leadership is essential and it is long since time for the political parties in Ireland to initiate a national conversation and to engage and listen to each other as they set out goals, aspirations and entitlements for an agreed future,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27411  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe Occupied Territories Bill - proposed by Senator Frances Black - is expected to pass due to the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Independents and Labour. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile welcomed the legislation, he said: “Goods and services that are only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be available in Ireland.\n\n\"On a daily basis, Palestinian villages are demolished and residents displaced to make way for the construction of more settlements,” he said.\n\"The international community considers the construction of Israeli settlements as illegal under International law and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n\"An EU report in 2017 outlined that continued settlement building places a great strain on efforts to reach a lasting and just resolution in the region.\"\nSenator Ó Donnghaile described the existence of settlements as a war crime and said the Irish government must comply with diplomatic and economic sanctions against the state of Israel.\n“The Irish government cannot on the one hand condemn these illegal colonial settlements and on the other hand freely trade with them.\n“This is the time for action and to make history.

disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of

Incidentally, both of those claims were the highest in the 40-member chamber.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f.jpg","title":"65207  ","story":"    \nTHE Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs believes that the recent sustained spell of hot weather - rather than pollution - has led to the deaths of a number of fish in a section of the Dunore River near Antrim.\nLocal man, James Cousley - who has lived on the Drennans Road\u0026#160 for more than 70 years - was distressed when he discovered the fish in the river, which runs alongside his property.\n\u0026#8220That river has been polluted before, less than two years ago, he said.\nBut after two visits by officials, DAERA was able to confirm that pollution had not caused the fish to die on this occasion.\nA\u0026#160 spokesperson said: The recent warm weather has led to high water temperatures in conjunction with lower base river flows in many waterways and this can have an adverse impact on the fishery and river ecology. \n\u0026#8220It is not unusual for dissolved oxygen levels to drop to critically low levels, particularly at night, which can result in fish mortalities.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren - including young children - made their way down Station Road, watched by spectators, they were unaware of a more sinister set of eyes trained upon them.\nVideo footage, which has spread on social media, shows a man in a beret and camouflage jacket with his face obscured by a scarf and sunglasses, raising what looks like an assault rifle before training it on those marching.\nWatching from a house on the route, he is being filmed as he appears to cock the rifle.\nAs the camera pans back towards the parade going past the house, he points the weapon in its direction before a disturbing \u0027click\u0027 - believed to be the trigger being pulled - can be heard off-camera.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f1.jpg","title":"65301  ","story":"    \nMUCKAMORE Seconds have reached the Ulster Plate final against Ardmore Seconds or Donemana Seconds on August 19.\nAnd the club\u0027s First XI gained more valuable points when they travelled to Stormont on Saturday to play CSNI in their latest Premier League match and completed the double over their arch-rivals in a vitally important game. \nThe fixture marked the debut of new signing Adam McDaid, who has joined this week from North West Club, Eglinton. \nThis weekend Muckamore travel to Armagh seeking a win against the bottom team, which would almost certainly secure the Antrim club\u0027s position in the Premier League next season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

However, she required further specialist treatment in the form of proton beam therapy in Jacksonville, America.\n  \nTo mark her last day at the centre, Zoe got to ring a large bell and also gave a graduation speech.\n  \nZoe\u0027s family have been fundraising, with the help of the local community, to enable them to stay in America for the duration of her treatment.\n  \nZoe\u0027s mother, Michelle said: “Zoe did a graduation speech at the lunch they have at the proton centre and had us all in tears. We are so very proud of her for being so strong and powering through this whole thing so far.\n  \n“This is by no means the end of Zoe\u0027s journey as she still has a lot of issues to deal with from the tumour, but it is the end of this part of her treatment which will hopefully do its job and stop anymore regrowth.\n  \n“At the end of treatment in Jacksonville every patient gets the chance to ring the bell (or chime) and it is so lovely to watch.”\n  \nIn her graduation speech Zoe said: “I would like to thank my amazing family, I am so grateful that they have supported me through my journey.”\n  \nShe also thanked the staff of the centre and everyone at home for all their support.\n  \nOver the last few months the local community has been rallying together to raise funds for Zoe and her family. \n  \n Michelle commented: “We can\u0027t thank everyone enough from family, friends, complete strangers, schools and local businesses for all their amazing love and support.\n  \n“Zoe still has a long way to go but with everyone behind her we know our girl will be ok. She has been a tower of strength since her diagnosis and during her time in America and we are so very proud of her.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"}]
