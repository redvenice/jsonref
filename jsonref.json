During Hajj, pilgrims will spend five days praying in Mecca and in the surrounding desert.While Hajj is a demonstration of the togetherness of Islamic people and their devotion to their God Allah, the other pillars of the religion are Shahadah, the belief in God and the acceptance of Muhammad as prophet Salat, prayer Zakat, charity and Sawn, which is fasting.What is the Stoning of the Devil ritual?According to Birmingham Mail, during Hajj millions of pilgrims gather at the Jamarat Bridge which houses three columns representing the devil and Muslims will throw seven pebbles at the largest of the columns.This act, which is referred to as Jamarat, takes place in the position where Ibrahim is thought to have done the same to frighten off the Devil after Allah had told him to sacrifice his son as a proof of faith and this is spot is where the Devil appeared to dissuade him from doing as Allah had asked.The Stoning of the Devil ritual occurs on the third day, which is also known as yawm-ul hajj al-akbar and is the longest day of pilgrimage, as well as the most dangerous. This is also when Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice, also takes place.          Muslim pilgrims around the Kaaba located in the centre of the Haram Sharif Great MosqueJamarat Bridge redesignAlthough the Jamarat Bridge was constructed in 1963, due to an increasing number of pilgrims visiting the site, the Saudi Arabian government decided to demolish the original structure in 2006 and start building the bridge from scratch.Birmingham Mail reported that before the upgrade, crowd density could reach up to 11-15 people per square metre at peak times, but local officials revealed that now there is one square metre per person. The new bridge also has five levels, hundreds of escalators, several lifts, two helipads and air conditioning.Otis Middle East’s Vice President and Managing Director Maged Nagib said: ‘With something this vital to Muslims worldwide, it is vital that outside factors do not disturb the true meaning of Hajj. The reconstruction of the Jamarat Bridge was an important step forward in terms of safety during the pilgrimage.’When is Hajj 2018?Typically the Hajj is a five-day pilgrimage that takes place from the 8th to the 12th day of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th and final month of the Islamic calendar. In 2018, Hajj will begin on Sunday, August 19 and continue until Friday, August 24.However, like all celebrations in the Muslim calendar, the event start will be determined by the sighting of the moon, which will in turn, reveals the date of Dhul-Hijjah and Eid Al-Adha.          Muslim pilgrims at Mount Arafat where Mohammed is believed to have given his final sermonWhen is Eid al-Adha?Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice which marks when Allah came to Ibrahim in a dream and asked him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience, will begin in the evening of August 21 and end in the evening of August 25.Bachelor in Paradise 2018 spoilers: Who is Jenna Cooper and who does she end up with?Who is Kathleen Folbigg?

Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story. Like any father I wanted to say a few words. I was going to thank the Royal Family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.\u0027He also launched a defense of his decision to speak to the media and claimed his Mail on Sunday interview would be his last – although he went on to speak to a tabloid newspaper less than 24 hours later.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday night, he added: \u0027I want to say good luck and God bless to my daughter. I don\u0027t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that\u0027s OK.\u0027All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.\u0027I now want to go on vacation somewhere to try and get some peace.\u0027The latest round of interviews come just seven days after the 74-year-old spent nine hours with the Mail on Sunday, during which he admitted to a drug-taking past, said Princess Diana would have \u0027loathed\u0027 the way he is being treated and hit out at Prince Harry – saying: \u0027I don\u0027t care if Harry never speaks to me again, I\u0027ll survive.\u0027          The source accused Markle Sr of selling salacious interviews to the press, and claims he has spoken to the media more than he has tried to contact Meghan           Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha, 53, has also turned on her and has given multiple interviews slamming the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himselfHis outbursts in the press follow a series of statements made to gossip website TMZ during the period around the royal wedding in May, following the paparazzi photo scandal.Although Markle Sr had been due to attend – and had his name printed in the program – he pulled out last minute after claiming to have suffered a heart attack.Despite telling the Mail on Sunday that he spent the day in a San Diego hospital bed, Markle Sr actually watched the nuptials from a $31-a-night Airbnb in Baja Malibu – a scruffy residential compound close to his home in San Antonio del Mar.He returned home on the Monday after the wedding and was pictured purchasing a creamy drink from Starbucks en route.Since then, the retired Emmy winner has repeatedly spoken out about his daughter and has insisted that he will continue to do so until she contacts him.He has also been pictured out and about in Los Angeles, where he was spotted purchasing a McDonalds meal on his birthday last month. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Markle Sr has been repeatedly pictured tucking into fast food – including McDonalds Happy Meals and KFC the latter shortly after he revealed he had had a heart attack.Although ex-wife Doria has remained silent about the Markle debacle currently engulfing the royal family, Meghan\u0027s half-siblings have spoken out – with sister Samantha describing the Duchess\u0027s treatment of her father as \u0027inhumane\u0027.She told the Mirror newspaper on Monday: \u0027There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.\u0027Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, later took to Twitter to lambaste her half-sister, describing her as \u0027heartless, arrogant and inhumane\u0027 in a series of late-night messages.The 53-year-old was echoed by her brother Thomas Markle Jr, 51, of Grants Pass, Oregon, who also slammed the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himself.He told the Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.\u0027Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/21/4F13040C00000578-0-image-m-46_1534191996763.jpg","title":"BRANDON LEWIS TORY CHAIRMAN Labour Jeremy Corbyn","story":"    Brandon Lewis, chairman of the Conservative Party, questions how Labour put up with Jeremy Corbyns on the grounds on basic decency Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has been embroiled in controversy. Behind his rhetoric about a \u0027kinder, gentler politics\u0027 there lurks a veteran hard-Left politician, characterised by radical dogmatism and worrying links with those hostile to the West.But even for this ideologue, an appalling new low has been reached as a result of the Daily Mail\u0027s revelations about Corbyn\u0027s attendance in 2014 — only a year before he became party leader — at a wreath-laying ceremony in Tunisia appearing to commemorate a group of terrorists from the Black September organisation, which perpetrated the infamous massacre of 11 Israelis at the Munich Olympics in 1972.Through both his attendance at the event and his offensive dissembling this week about his role, Corbyn has exposed himself as unfit for senior public office, never mind his position as the official Leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition. Labour in the past has always had its sincere policy differences with the Conservatives, but its leading figures have belonged to the democratic, patriotic mainstream.Clement Attlee was an army major in World War I, Denis Healey a beach master at the Anzio landings in World War II. Tony Benn served as an RAF officer, and Jim Callaghan in the Royal Navy. But Corbyn is completely orced from this tradition.From London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this articleThe exposure of his Tunisian escapade in 2014 is just the latest in this unedifying pattern, but the incident is beyond the pale. The 1972 Munich attack was one of the darkest episodes in modern history. It is deeply worrying to know that a man at the top level of public life in Britain felt, only four years ago, that he should attend such an event.What is almost as reprehensible is the attempt by Corbyn and his team to mislead the British public, once the investigation was published. At first his office engaged in the simple tactic of denial.          The Labour leader (pictured on Sky News today on a visit to the Midlands) faced the cameras after a photograph of him holding a wreath near the graves of Palestinian activists linked to the 1972 Munich massacre - which left 11 Israelis dead, emerged. He said he attended a ceremony in Tunis in 2014 because he wanted to commemorate all those killed in atrocitiesAccording to this narrative, the story was a \u0027smear,\u0027 \u0027fake news\u0027 and a \u0027hoax.\u0027 But the weight of evidence made this impossible to sustain. Not only were there photographs of Corbyn holding a wreath near the memorial to the terrorists, but he had also boasted about his attendance at the event in his column in the Morning Star, a communist newspaper.Confronted with this material, Corbyn resorted in interviews yesterday to more prevarication, arguing that he was present at the commemoration but \u0027I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it.\u0027 Such a form of words would be laughable were it not so serious.The Tunisian debacle may be appalling, but sadly, it is no longer shocking. As the MP for Islington North since 1983, Corbyn has been behaving like this throughout his Parliamentary career.When he was an obscure backbencher and serial far-left rebel, his conduct was not so important. But now, he is the Opposition Leader, and exposure of his past is vital. This is a man whose leadership, in less than three years, has not put an end to the vile anti-semitism flourishing within his party, not least because of his own hostility to Israel.Corbyn has regularly shown contempt for the state of Israel, not just its government and its policies, such as in 2010 when he used the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day to host an explosively controversial meeting in Westminster at which nauseating comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany were loudly voiced, something the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) describes as clearly anti-semitic.In 2010 he told a crowd of protestors outside the Israeli Embassy that the position of Gaza was similar to the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the Russian resistance to Nazism in the Second World War. In 2013, he compared Israel\u0027s actions in the West Bank to the Nazi occupation of Europe in World War Two.In the same disreputable vein, in 2012 he used Facebook to express his support for a work in East London by graffiti artist Mear One, who had painted a clearly anti-semitic mural of Jewish plutocrats exploiting the poor.Corbyn told the artist he was \u0027in good company\u0027, a remark for which he later apologised. But precious few other apologies have been forthcoming from Corbyn, not even over his description of the anti-semitic terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u0027our friends\u0027 at an event in Westminster in 2009.Much to the incandescent fury of respected MPs like Margaret Hodge – who lost several members of her own family in the Holocaust – Corbyn\u0027s team has refused to write the globally accepted definition of anti-semitism drawn up by the IHRA into Labour\u0027s rulebook.It is an unbelievable situation in a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice. Indeed, Corbyn likes to portray himself as a passionate warrior against discrimination, but his deeds hardly match his words.           Jeremy Corbyn is pictured with members of a delegation of Palestinian officials at the graveyard in Tunis in 2014, with the wreath which was laid in the cemetery to honour Palestinian \u0027martyrs\u0027.  He has admitted being at the ceremony after initially insisting he was there for a tribute to different PalestiniansHe has been painfully slow to speak out against the anti-semitic abuse meted out to some of his own Labour MPs, like Luciana Berger, by hard-left activists.This is beyond normal Party politics, as this is an issue far beyond the traditional, century-long battle between Conservatives and Labour. I remember the Labour party of old and it saddens me to see it in this state. Thanks to Corbyn\u0027s leadership, decent, moderate Labour activists and MPs are in complete despair at what is happening at the very top of the Labour party.Yet it is only Labour that can sort out this problem. How much longer is the party going to put up with a leader who obfuscates about his past, who equivocates about anti-semitism, who lambasted the BBC for \u0027bias\u0027 for saying Israel has the right to exist, who refuses to be accountable for his actions and who will not even defend his own MPs and members from racist abuse?At such a crucial time for Britain\u0027s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.For the sake of democracy and decency in public life, decent members of the Labour party must ask, is this man fit to lead them and to be leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition?  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/22/170A804300000514-0-image-m-41_1534194259146.jpg","title":"Benjamin Netanyahu condemns Jeremy Corbyn wreath laying","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn is seen posing with a wreath under a distinctive red canopy as other politicians look on.

Mr Corbyn appears to be adjusting the wreath, which is being held by Salman El Herfi, the Palestinian ambassador in Tunisia. He is still standing by the graves of the men linked to the terror attackOn another dramatic day yesterday:Families of Israeli athletes killed in the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre called on Mr Corbyn to apologise and step down as Labour leader.It emerged that the Stop the War campaign group published an incendiary article playing down the brutal killings as unintentional while Mr Corbyn was its chairman.The BBC largely ignored the revelations about Mr Corbyn\u0027s visit to the graves of the Black September terrorists – while giving extensive coverage to the week-old row about Boris Johnson\u0027s burka remarks.Mr Netanyahu criticised Mr Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony where a wreath was laid in memory of Palestinians suspected of being behind the Munich Olympics massacre.The Israeli PM accused the Labour leader of laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the 1972 atrocity in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed, after photos published by the Mail on Saturday showed him holding the floral tribute at the foot of the memorial.          Jeremy Corbyn raises his hands in what appears to be an Islamic prayer position as he stands beside other politicians. A source said he was not praying but \u0027copying the others out of respect\u0027Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: \u0027The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – Left, Right and everything in between.\u0027The second reference was to a video which surfaced last week which appeared to show Mr Corbyn likening the situation in the West Bank to occupations during the Second World War.Soon after Mr Netanyahu\u0027s tweet, however, Mr Corbyn hit back. He wrote on Twitter: \u0027Israeli PM @Netanyahu\u0027s claims about my actions and words are false. \u0027What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.\u0027The Labour leader then tweeted: \u0027The nation state law sponsored by Netanyahu\u0027s government discriminates against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority.           Mr Corbyn looks at a plaque which honours Khalaf, al-Omari and Abdel-Hamid. It describes them as ‘martyrs’ who were assassinated in 1991. A wreath that looks very similar to the one Mr Corbyn was holding in the earlier two photographs is seen beside the plaque, circled \u0027I stand with the tens of thousands of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel demonstrating for equal rights at the weekend in Tel Aviv.\u0027Earlier, Mr Corbyn had finally been forced to address the growing row during a visit to Walsall, but his attempt to calm the situation served only to inflame it. Asked about the controversy, Mr Corbyn said: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended the conference to those that were killed in Paris in 1992.\u0027I was present when it was laid. I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it (laying it). I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it.\u0027Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger last night hit back at Mr Corbyn\u0027s attempted explanation.           The Israeli PM condemned Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter and urged those of the left and right to unite to in criticising the Labour leader           Mr Corbyn has hit back at Mr Netanyahu\u0027s claims, calling them \u0027false\u0027 on Twitter          Mr Corbyn also blasted the Israeli PM for laws sponsored by his government that \u0027discriminate against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority\u0027      \u0027We hope that all Labour MPs, members and those in the media will show the integrity that this case demands and continue to hold Mr Corbyn to account over this appalling incident.\u0027 Jennifer Gerber, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said: \u0027Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s latest statement is a further insult to those savagely murdered at Munich and their bereaved relatives.\u0027He says he was paying respect to victims of terrorism when there is clear photographic evidence of him holding a wreath. Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s appalling actions, and Labour\u0027s attempted cover-up, is another truly shameful day for the party he leads.\u0027   Atef Bseiso (left) was head of intelligence for the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) before his assassination outside a Paris hotel in 1992. It was widely reported he was shot because he helped plan the Munich Massacre in 1972. Hayel Abdel-Hamidwas chief of security for the PLO. He was a close adviser to Salah Khalaf, and the pair were killed in an attack in Abdel-Hamid\u0027s home in the Tunisian capital Tunis in 1991  Salah Khalaf (left) is widely believed to have masterminded the Munich Massacre. He created Black September and went on to become Yasser Arafat\u0027s second-in-command in the PLO.

It\u0027s as though they expect people to knock on the door and thank them for their generosity.What that \u0027Please Take\u0027 note is apparently supposed to imply is: \u0027Lord Muck and Lady Bountiful live here. We no longer need these articles from our less affluent youth. If you\u0027re in need, and unlike us you cannot afford to buy beautiful new furniture, by all means do yourselves a favour.\u0027          Out of tune: In my home town of Bristol, it has become an epidemic. The rubbish can sit there for days, sometimes weeks (Above, a broken piano \u0027free\u0027 to a good home) I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy. They can\u0027t be bothered to go to the tip. Instead, they expect you to make their lives easier by providing a free rubbish clearance service. They should be ashamed, but they\u0027ve deluded themselves that they are better people for it. They are, in short, middle-class fly-tippers.\u0027These self-righteous local nuisances might think there\u0027s no harm in what they\u0027re doing, but there\u0027s no such thing as harmless junk.          Any takers? These smug litterbugs pretend they\u0027re doing a community service by offering their detritus for free (Above, a selection of items offered outside a home in south east London) Unwanted items seem to call out to local yobs and vandals. Armchairs that were smart and expensive in the shop window will be dragged away, stained, slashed, ripped up, and finally broken into springs and splinters within days of being placed on the pavement.The bits and pieces left behind then lurk around under the hedges until a civic-minded neighbour (what a relief to know some of them still exist!) takes the trouble to clear them up.In the elegant streets of Clifton, an area of Bristol estate agents would call \u0027affluent and leafy\u0027, on Thursday, I noticed a lady piling plastic chairs and tatty old electrical items outside her front steps.Jogger confronts \u0027courier\u0027 hurling parcels into the bushes...Working like a dog!

Their legs were scuffed and the purple cushions had seen better days, but there wasn\u0027t a lot wrong with them.          Free to a good home? I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy\u0027 (Above, Christopher Stevens) During the night, they inevitably migrated to the lane beside my house. It\u0027s a busy shortcut to the main road and, after the pubs close, just about anything small enough to lift — most often bikes or knackered scooters — is likely to make its way there.These purple chairs were placed at right angles to each other, behind my garden fence. The ground was scattered with cigarette butts and a couple of crushed beer cans. It looked like the people who took them had sat there for quite a while.I don\u0027t want the lane turning into an alfresco nightclub. And I\u0027m certainly not keen on anything being left that might be used as a makeshift step-ladder next to my fence. There are enough break-ins in Bristol without giving the burglars a leg-up.True, I could take them back to the house round the corner, but they\u0027ll only end up on the street again. Once a dining suite has hit the skids, there\u0027s no way back.If I had all the time in the world, I might find a local charity and donate the chairs to be \u0027free-cycled\u0027 — given to someone who could genuinely use this tat. It\u0027s hard to think who that could be, though, given that the era in which the poor kissed the hands of the gentry in thanks for their cast-offs ended with Queen Victoria.                            Middle-class fly-tipping is really about saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead                        I can\u0027t put the chairs in a wheelie bin without incurring a hefty fine, and the council will charge me £15 if I want to have them collected. There is an online \u0027freecycling exchange\u0027 in Bristol but it doesn\u0027t seem to be very active.So this morning it falls to me to sling these wretched chairs in the back of the car, along with a broken strimmer and some plastic waste I\u0027ve been meaning to jettison for ages, and take them to the tip — or, to use its proper title, the St Philips Household Waste Recycling Centre.In other words, I\u0027ll end up doing exactly what the owner of the chairs should have done in the first place. I\u0027m saving him the trouble.This cuts to the heart of what middle-class fly-tipping is really about: saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead. It\u0027s not dumping rubbish: it\u0027s dumping a problem.It\u0027s why people pile tatty paperbacks and children\u0027s picture books by the garden gate, with a sign that says: \u0027Help yourself, happy reading!\u0027           Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shopAnyone who genuinely wanted their dog-eared Harry Potters to give entertainment to a new generation would take half an hour and go to the nearest charity bookshop — there are at least a dozen within a mile of my house.Instead, people just strew their driveway with heaps of books and plastic toys, making the street look like an unattended car boot sale. Even if it rains, the books stay there for days, quietly rotting.Sometimes, the middle-class fly-tipper isn\u0027t even generous enough to give away their rubbish.Earlier this year I came upon a lounge unit of drawers and shelves, with a table for a TV, propped up against the wall of a house. A scrawled sign said, \u0027£25 or nearest offer\u0027.The Formica was stained with tea-mug rings and peeled back to expose frayed chipboard at the corners. The whole contraption tilted sideways, as if it were too exhausted to stand up straight. No one in their right mind would pay £25 for a stranger\u0027s scrap.                            Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop                        If anyone\u0027s to blame for the rise of the middle-class fly-tipper, it\u0027s Kirstie Allsopp. She\u0027s not actually middle-class, by the way — she\u0027s the daughter of a hereditary peer, the sixth Baron Hindlip. But she did popularise the craze for foisting worn-out furniture on people, with a TV show about \u0027upcycling\u0027 called Fill Your House For Free.Kirstie\u0027s scheme was to take sagging sofas and decrepit kitchen cupboards, give them a lick of paint and pretend they were lovely. She broke a painter\u0027s stepladder in two and nailed it to the wall as a pair of wonky shelves. A rusty barbecue pan, sprayed gold, became a lampshade.Stupidest of all, she had a tradesman saw an iron bath in two. When he had glued a couple of cushions into one end, Kirstie announced it was \u0027an upcycled easy-chair\u0027.Reviewing the show for my Mail TV column four years ago, I pointed out this was sheer pretension. Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop.Kirstie and her trendy tribe of \u0027upcyclers\u0027 have given a licence to lazy middle-class house-holders to dump their junk on the street and feel they\u0027ve done the world a favour.So here\u0027s a message for them all.

She also claimed that the 47-year-old had taken acid before he sent that tweet           \u0027I saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his ass after that tweet,\u0027 she said of Musk over the weekend. \u0027He was stressed and red in the face.\u0027\u0027I waited around all weekend while Grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on Twitter while on acid,\u0027 she added on Instagram. In subsequent posts, Banks even suggested that the couple may have invited her to their home for \u0027some weird threesome sex s**t to begin with.\u0027She also went on a vicious rant about Grimes, who she branded an \u0027idiot, Musk who she called a \u0027beta male\u0027 and branded them both \u0027crackhead\u0027 in a rambling attack.A rep for Musk\u0027s dismissed Banks\u0027 claims as \u0027absolute nonsense.\u0027 They would not confirm whether or not Banks had spent the weekend at one of his homes.But the representative denied that Musk had ever met the rapper.       A spokesperson  told Business Insider: \u0027Elon has never even met Ms. Banks or communicated with her in any way.\u0027DailyMail.com has reached out for further comment. Tesla declined to comment on the claims about Musk looking for investors.Banks had announced in June that she and Grimes, a fellow singer and songwriter who began dating Musk earlier this year, were working together on Banks\u0027 second album.She said she arrived at one of Musk\u0027s homes in Los Angeles early on Friday but said she was left alone for days while Grimes comforted her boyfriend.\u0027Staying in Elon musks house has been like a real like episode of \u0027Get Out\u0027, she wrote.          Banks finally left on Sunday night. A separate source confirmed to the Insider that Banks was at one of Musk\u0027s properties over the weekend.Banks says Musk was panicked after his Tuesday tweet, when he announced he was considering taking the firm private at $420 per share, adding that funding was \u0027secured.\u0027 The surprise tweets caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with regulators looking into whether the statements were truthful and why Musk announced them via Twitter.Additionally, Musk and Tesla are being sued by investors who claim the plan to go private was part of a \u0027fraudulent scheme\u0027 to punish short-sellers, or investors who borrow stock in a company with the hope shares will fall. The plaintiffs also allege that Musk\u0027s announcements artificially inflated Tesla\u0027s stock price and violated securities laws. Shares of Tesla were sliding more than 1 percent to $351.80 on Monday morning.     Tesla boss Elon Musk shocked Wall Street last week when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and that funding was secured          Musk added that investor support was \u0027confirmed\u0027 and that the Tesla board had already met \u0027several times\u0027 in the past few weeks to discuss the proposal to take the firm privateMusk attempted to clear up his tweets in the blog post Monday. \u0027Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,\u0027 Musk wrote in the blog post. \u0027They first met with me at the beginning of 2017 to express this interest because of the important need to ersify away from oil.\u0027They then held several additional meetings with me over the next year to reiterate this interest and to try to move forward with a going private transaction,\u0027 Musk added. This isn\u0027t the first time Banks has made unproven claims against celebrities. In 2016, accused Beyoncé on Twitter of stealing from other artists, while in June this year, she was kicked off Twitter for insulting RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race contestant Monet X Change."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/08/4F14676B00000578-6058241-image-a-1_1534231659321.jpg","title":"Cheetah sits open sun roof poses incredible safari photo","story":"    Leilani, 13, was brave enough to pose for a photo with a cheetah who jumped on their jeep in Serengeti          The predator lay in the shade and sat comfortably with its paw through the window while the frightened family stared in disbeliefThe cat, who pants and flops his paw comfortably through the window, appeared to be more concerned about keeping himself in the shade than by the frightened family staring back at them.The camera panned around the group who  laugh nervously in disbelief at the once-in-a-lifetime encounter with the cheetah.A mother’s pride: Lioness leads her cubs down to waterhole...Share this article A fearless tour guide immediately takes his phone out to snap some photos and says \u0027it\u0027s a selfie!\u0027Thirteen-year-old Leilani came face-to-face with the predator as she neared close to the wild cat to have her photo taken.

Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story. Like any father I wanted to say a few words. I was going to thank the Royal Family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.\u0027He also launched a defense of his decision to speak to the media and claimed his Mail on Sunday interview would be his last – although he went on to speak to a tabloid newspaper less than 24 hours later.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday night, he added: \u0027I want to say good luck and God bless to my daughter. I don\u0027t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that\u0027s OK.\u0027All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.\u0027I now want to go on vacation somewhere to try and get some peace.\u0027The latest round of interviews come just seven days after the 74-year-old spent nine hours with the Mail on Sunday, during which he admitted to a drug-taking past, said Princess Diana would have \u0027loathed\u0027 the way he is being treated and hit out at Prince Harry – saying: \u0027I don\u0027t care if Harry never speaks to me again, I\u0027ll survive.\u0027          The source accused Markle Sr of selling salacious interviews to the press, and claims he has spoken to the media more than he has tried to contact Meghan           Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha, 53, has also turned on her and has given multiple interviews slamming the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himselfHis outbursts in the press follow a series of statements made to gossip website TMZ during the period around the royal wedding in May, following the paparazzi photo scandal.Although Markle Sr had been due to attend – and had his name printed in the program – he pulled out last minute after claiming to have suffered a heart attack.Despite telling the Mail on Sunday that he spent the day in a San Diego hospital bed, Markle Sr actually watched the nuptials from a $31-a-night Airbnb in Baja Malibu – a scruffy residential compound close to his home in San Antonio del Mar.He returned home on the Monday after the wedding and was pictured purchasing a creamy drink from Starbucks en route.Since then, the retired Emmy winner has repeatedly spoken out about his daughter and has insisted that he will continue to do so until she contacts him.He has also been pictured out and about in Los Angeles, where he was spotted purchasing a McDonalds meal on his birthday last month. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Markle Sr has been repeatedly pictured tucking into fast food – including McDonalds Happy Meals and KFC the latter shortly after he revealed he had had a heart attack.Although ex-wife Doria has remained silent about the Markle debacle currently engulfing the royal family, Meghan\u0027s half-siblings have spoken out – with sister Samantha describing the Duchess\u0027s treatment of her father as \u0027inhumane\u0027.She told the Mirror newspaper on Monday: \u0027There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.\u0027Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, later took to Twitter to lambaste her half-sister, describing her as \u0027heartless, arrogant and inhumane\u0027 in a series of late-night messages.The 53-year-old was echoed by her brother Thomas Markle Jr, 51, of Grants Pass, Oregon, who also slammed the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himself.He told the Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.\u0027Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/21/4F13040C00000578-0-image-m-46_1534191996763.jpg","title":"BRANDON LEWIS TORY CHAIRMAN Labour Jeremy Corbyn","story":"    Brandon Lewis, chairman of the Conservative Party, questions how Labour put up with Jeremy Corbyns on the grounds on basic decency Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has been embroiled in controversy. Behind his rhetoric about a \u0027kinder, gentler politics\u0027 there lurks a veteran hard-Left politician, characterised by radical dogmatism and worrying links with those hostile to the West.But even for this ideologue, an appalling new low has been reached as a result of the Daily Mail\u0027s revelations about Corbyn\u0027s attendance in 2014 — only a year before he became party leader — at a wreath-laying ceremony in Tunisia appearing to commemorate a group of terrorists from the Black September organisation, which perpetrated the infamous massacre of 11 Israelis at the Munich Olympics in 1972.Through both his attendance at the event and his offensive dissembling this week about his role, Corbyn has exposed himself as unfit for senior public office, never mind his position as the official Leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition. Labour in the past has always had its sincere policy differences with the Conservatives, but its leading figures have belonged to the democratic, patriotic mainstream.Clement Attlee was an army major in World War I, Denis Healey a beach master at the Anzio landings in World War II. Tony Benn served as an RAF officer, and Jim Callaghan in the Royal Navy. But Corbyn is completely orced from this tradition.From London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this articleThe exposure of his Tunisian escapade in 2014 is just the latest in this unedifying pattern, but the incident is beyond the pale. The 1972 Munich attack was one of the darkest episodes in modern history. It is deeply worrying to know that a man at the top level of public life in Britain felt, only four years ago, that he should attend such an event.What is almost as reprehensible is the attempt by Corbyn and his team to mislead the British public, once the investigation was published. At first his office engaged in the simple tactic of denial.          The Labour leader (pictured on Sky News today on a visit to the Midlands) faced the cameras after a photograph of him holding a wreath near the graves of Palestinian activists linked to the 1972 Munich massacre - which left 11 Israelis dead, emerged. He said he attended a ceremony in Tunis in 2014 because he wanted to commemorate all those killed in atrocitiesAccording to this narrative, the story was a \u0027smear,\u0027 \u0027fake news\u0027 and a \u0027hoax.\u0027 But the weight of evidence made this impossible to sustain. Not only were there photographs of Corbyn holding a wreath near the memorial to the terrorists, but he had also boasted about his attendance at the event in his column in the Morning Star, a communist newspaper.Confronted with this material, Corbyn resorted in interviews yesterday to more prevarication, arguing that he was present at the commemoration but \u0027I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it.\u0027 Such a form of words would be laughable were it not so serious.The Tunisian debacle may be appalling, but sadly, it is no longer shocking. As the MP for Islington North since 1983, Corbyn has been behaving like this throughout his Parliamentary career.When he was an obscure backbencher and serial far-left rebel, his conduct was not so important. But now, he is the Opposition Leader, and exposure of his past is vital. This is a man whose leadership, in less than three years, has not put an end to the vile anti-semitism flourishing within his party, not least because of his own hostility to Israel.Corbyn has regularly shown contempt for the state of Israel, not just its government and its policies, such as in 2010 when he used the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day to host an explosively controversial meeting in Westminster at which nauseating comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany were loudly voiced, something the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) describes as clearly anti-semitic.In 2010 he told a crowd of protestors outside the Israeli Embassy that the position of Gaza was similar to the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the Russian resistance to Nazism in the Second World War. In 2013, he compared Israel\u0027s actions in the West Bank to the Nazi occupation of Europe in World War Two.In the same disreputable vein, in 2012 he used Facebook to express his support for a work in East London by graffiti artist Mear One, who had painted a clearly anti-semitic mural of Jewish plutocrats exploiting the poor.Corbyn told the artist he was \u0027in good company\u0027, a remark for which he later apologised. But precious few other apologies have been forthcoming from Corbyn, not even over his description of the anti-semitic terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u0027our friends\u0027 at an event in Westminster in 2009.Much to the incandescent fury of respected MPs like Margaret Hodge – who lost several members of her own family in the Holocaust – Corbyn\u0027s team has refused to write the globally accepted definition of anti-semitism drawn up by the IHRA into Labour\u0027s rulebook.It is an unbelievable situation in a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice. Indeed, Corbyn likes to portray himself as a passionate warrior against discrimination, but his deeds hardly match his words.           Jeremy Corbyn is pictured with members of a delegation of Palestinian officials at the graveyard in Tunis in 2014, with the wreath which was laid in the cemetery to honour Palestinian \u0027martyrs\u0027.  He has admitted being at the ceremony after initially insisting he was there for a tribute to different PalestiniansHe has been painfully slow to speak out against the anti-semitic abuse meted out to some of his own Labour MPs, like Luciana Berger, by hard-left activists.This is beyond normal Party politics, as this is an issue far beyond the traditional, century-long battle between Conservatives and Labour. I remember the Labour party of old and it saddens me to see it in this state. Thanks to Corbyn\u0027s leadership, decent, moderate Labour activists and MPs are in complete despair at what is happening at the very top of the Labour party.Yet it is only Labour that can sort out this problem. How much longer is the party going to put up with a leader who obfuscates about his past, who equivocates about anti-semitism, who lambasted the BBC for \u0027bias\u0027 for saying Israel has the right to exist, who refuses to be accountable for his actions and who will not even defend his own MPs and members from racist abuse?At such a crucial time for Britain\u0027s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.For the sake of democracy and decency in public life, decent members of the Labour party must ask, is this man fit to lead them and to be leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition?  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/07/4F1444AC00000578-6057379-image-a-30_1534228701557.jpg","title":"Middle class fly tippers offering old furniture theyre lazy tip","story":"    Junk yard: Littering the garden walls and pavements of suburban Britain, there\u0027s a new scourge — middle-class fly-tipping (pictured above, \u0027free items\u0027 left outside a home in Bristol) And the most galling thing is that these smug litterbugs pretend they\u0027re doing a community service by offering their detritus for free. They\u0027re not trying to hide the stuff — they\u0027re proud of it. It\u0027s as though they expect people to knock on the door and thank them for their generosity.What that \u0027Please Take\u0027 note is apparently supposed to imply is: \u0027Lord Muck and Lady Bountiful live here. We no longer need these articles from our less affluent youth. If you\u0027re in need, and unlike us you cannot afford to buy beautiful new furniture, by all means do yourselves a favour.\u0027          Out of tune: In my home town of Bristol, it has become an epidemic. The rubbish can sit there for days, sometimes weeks (Above, a broken piano \u0027free\u0027 to a good home) I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy. They can\u0027t be bothered to go to the tip. Instead, they expect you to make their lives easier by providing a free rubbish clearance service. They should be ashamed, but they\u0027ve deluded themselves that they are better people for it. They are, in short, middle-class fly-tippers.\u0027These self-righteous local nuisances might think there\u0027s no harm in what they\u0027re doing, but there\u0027s no such thing as harmless junk.          Any takers? These smug litterbugs pretend they\u0027re doing a community service by offering their detritus for free (Above, a selection of items offered outside a home in south east London) Unwanted items seem to call out to local yobs and vandals. Armchairs that were smart and expensive in the shop window will be dragged away, stained, slashed, ripped up, and finally broken into springs and splinters within days of being placed on the pavement.The bits and pieces left behind then lurk around under the hedges until a civic-minded neighbour (what a relief to know some of them still exist!) takes the trouble to clear them up.In the elegant streets of Clifton, an area of Bristol estate agents would call \u0027affluent and leafy\u0027, on Thursday, I noticed a lady piling plastic chairs and tatty old electrical items outside her front steps.Jogger confronts \u0027courier\u0027 hurling parcels into the bushes...Working like a dog!

This was on the pavement outside some of my city\u0027s most glorious Georgian terraces. I asked if she was having a clear-out. \u0027It\u0027s amazing,\u0027 she said, \u0027people will take any old rubbish.\u0027She cast a glance at a rusty wine rack, and added: \u0027I doubt anyone will take this, but my husband\u0027s got three and they\u0027ve got to go.\u0027Last weekend, a bloke round the corner placed two dining chairs by his gate. Their legs were scuffed and the purple cushions had seen better days, but there wasn\u0027t a lot wrong with them.          Free to a good home? I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy\u0027 (Above, Christopher Stevens) During the night, they inevitably migrated to the lane beside my house. It\u0027s a busy shortcut to the main road and, after the pubs close, just about anything small enough to lift — most often bikes or knackered scooters — is likely to make its way there.These purple chairs were placed at right angles to each other, behind my garden fence. The ground was scattered with cigarette butts and a couple of crushed beer cans. It looked like the people who took them had sat there for quite a while.I don\u0027t want the lane turning into an alfresco nightclub. And I\u0027m certainly not keen on anything being left that might be used as a makeshift step-ladder next to my fence. There are enough break-ins in Bristol without giving the burglars a leg-up.True, I could take them back to the house round the corner, but they\u0027ll only end up on the street again. Once a dining suite has hit the skids, there\u0027s no way back.If I had all the time in the world, I might find a local charity and donate the chairs to be \u0027free-cycled\u0027 — given to someone who could genuinely use this tat. It\u0027s hard to think who that could be, though, given that the era in which the poor kissed the hands of the gentry in thanks for their cast-offs ended with Queen Victoria.                            Middle-class fly-tipping is really about saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead                        I can\u0027t put the chairs in a wheelie bin without incurring a hefty fine, and the council will charge me £15 if I want to have them collected. There is an online \u0027freecycling exchange\u0027 in Bristol but it doesn\u0027t seem to be very active.So this morning it falls to me to sling these wretched chairs in the back of the car, along with a broken strimmer and some plastic waste I\u0027ve been meaning to jettison for ages, and take them to the tip — or, to use its proper title, the St Philips Household Waste Recycling Centre.In other words, I\u0027ll end up doing exactly what the owner of the chairs should have done in the first place. I\u0027m saving him the trouble.This cuts to the heart of what middle-class fly-tipping is really about: saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead. It\u0027s not dumping rubbish: it\u0027s dumping a problem.It\u0027s why people pile tatty paperbacks and children\u0027s picture books by the garden gate, with a sign that says: \u0027Help yourself, happy reading!\u0027           Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shopAnyone who genuinely wanted their dog-eared Harry Potters to give entertainment to a new generation would take half an hour and go to the nearest charity bookshop — there are at least a dozen within a mile of my house.Instead, people just strew their driveway with heaps of books and plastic toys, making the street look like an unattended car boot sale. Even if it rains, the books stay there for days, quietly rotting.Sometimes, the middle-class fly-tipper isn\u0027t even generous enough to give away their rubbish.Earlier this year I came upon a lounge unit of drawers and shelves, with a table for a TV, propped up against the wall of a house. A scrawled sign said, \u0027£25 or nearest offer\u0027.The Formica was stained with tea-mug rings and peeled back to expose frayed chipboard at the corners. The whole contraption tilted sideways, as if it were too exhausted to stand up straight. No one in their right mind would pay £25 for a stranger\u0027s scrap.                            Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop                        If anyone\u0027s to blame for the rise of the middle-class fly-tipper, it\u0027s Kirstie Allsopp. She\u0027s not actually middle-class, by the way — she\u0027s the daughter of a hereditary peer, the sixth Baron Hindlip. But she did popularise the craze for foisting worn-out furniture on people, with a TV show about \u0027upcycling\u0027 called Fill Your House For Free.Kirstie\u0027s scheme was to take sagging sofas and decrepit kitchen cupboards, give them a lick of paint and pretend they were lovely. She broke a painter\u0027s stepladder in two and nailed it to the wall as a pair of wonky shelves. A rusty barbecue pan, sprayed gold, became a lampshade.Stupidest of all, she had a tradesman saw an iron bath in two. When he had glued a couple of cushions into one end, Kirstie announced it was \u0027an upcycled easy-chair\u0027.Reviewing the show for my Mail TV column four years ago, I pointed out this was sheer pretension. Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop.Kirstie and her trendy tribe of \u0027upcyclers\u0027 have given a licence to lazy middle-class house-holders to dump their junk on the street and feel they\u0027ve done the world a favour.So here\u0027s a message for them all. I don\u0027t want your old furniture. And neither does anyone else. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/08/4F14676B00000578-6058241-image-a-1_1534231659321.jpg","title":"Cheetah sits open sun roof poses incredible safari photo","story":"    Leilani, 13, was brave enough to pose for a photo with a cheetah who jumped on their jeep in Serengeti          The predator lay in the shade and sat comfortably with its paw through the window while the frightened family stared in disbeliefThe cat, who pants and flops his paw comfortably through the window, appeared to be more concerned about keeping himself in the shade than by the frightened family staring back at them.The camera panned around the group who  laugh nervously in disbelief at the once-in-a-lifetime encounter with the cheetah.A mother’s pride: Lioness leads her cubs down to waterhole...Share this article A fearless tour guide immediately takes his phone out to snap some photos and says \u0027it\u0027s a selfie!\u0027Thirteen-year-old Leilani came face-to-face with the predator as she neared close to the wild cat to have her photo taken.

In his famous attack on sensation novels in the Quarterly Review, HL Mansel inadvertently explained the appeal of this thrilling realism:The sensation novel, be it mere trash or something worse, is usually a tale of our own times. Proximity is, indeed, one great element of sensation. It is necessary to be near a mine to be blown up by its explosion and a tale which aims at electrifying the nerves of the reader is never thoroughly effective unless the scene be laid in our own day and among the people we are in the habit of meeting.Where Mansel saw a “morbid” cheap trick, others such as Henry James saw something far more interesting. Wilkie Collins, said James, revealed:Those most mysterious of mysteries, the mysteries which are at our own doors. The innovation gave a new impetus to the literature of horrors … Instead of the terrors of Udolpho, we were treated to the terrors of the cheerful country house or the London lodgings. And there is no doubt that these were infinitely more terrible.Victorian readers could see themselves – or at least, their contemporaries – in Collins’s novels. This domestic immediacy didn’t just make the books chilling, it also made them persuasive social documents. Later on in Collins’s career his campaigning fervour supposedly got the better of plots, prompting his friend Algernon Swinburne to lament: “What brought good Wilkie’s genius nigh perdition?  Some demon whispered—’Wilkie! have a mission.’” But in earlier books, he was able to make serious, important points without compromising on the storytelling. The Woman In White highlighted unscrupulous practices in private asylums. And The Moonstone is a fascinating barometer both of Victorian attitudes, and the opposition towards them. If, for instance, you were of the opinion that our ancestors were all gung-ho Christians, you need only read the hypocritical narrative of Miss Clack and the humour Collins wrings out of her greed, folly, false piety and the deathly boring tracts she delivers. His ambivalence towards imperialism is even more striking the intricate plot set into motion by a brutal crime committed by British soldiers against Indians, with plenty of unsettling imagery showing Collins’s clear awareness of the pain and injustice of empire.He also challenges ideas about race relations. The three Indian “jugglers” who arrive to reclaim their stolen treasure may be objects of fear and distrust for the first narrator Betteredge, but by the end of the story they emerge with more dignity and intelligence than almost anyone else except the remarkable star of the later pages, Jennings. This complicated character is a victim of colonialism in the circumstances of his birth: “I was born, and partly brought up, in one of our colonies,” he explains. “My father was an Englishman but my mother– ”. That silence speaks volumes. Meanwhile, the prejudice he bears for his “Gypsy” looks is portrayed as a deep and painful injustice. This is all the more stark when it is Jennings who eventually solves the novel’s mystery – a shunned outsider who succeeds where other gentleman upheld by society (a lawyer, a doctor, a famous police detective) have all failed.There’s plenty of criticism of class structures. In spite of his warmth and general decency, Betteredge is casually violent in his treatment of female servants: “Nancy tried to push by, without answering upon which I rose up, and took her by the ear.” Betteredge may unthinkingly use force, but there’s no doubting that Collins himself has carefully considered the implications as early as 1856, he was writing of female drudgery in Household Words: “No human being ever was created for this.”In The Moonstone, the women are well aware that their lot is unjust. “The day is not far off when the poor will rise against the rich,” declares the fiery Limping Lucy in protest at the unthinking treatment her friend Rosanna has received. (Significantly, the book was set in 1848). Rosanna’s inability to make herself heard by her betters is another essential key to the story: if her humanity had been more respected - or even noticed – everyone else would have been spared an awful lot of trouble.But of course, if that had happened, that beautiful long chain of circumstance would have been broken early on and we’d have missed out on this tremendous novel and all its trenchant commentary on Victorian society. We’d also have missed the unforgettable final revelations – but more on those next week.

So what to name this little venture? Amish Buggy Rides? Tim’s Horse and Wagon? Nope. How about: “Amish Uber”. Genius. Publicity followed – and lots of it.“Uber is a cool thing,” Hochstedler told local news station WMMT. “Every single year something new comes in and Uber is hot right now, so we have the Amish Uber.”Let’s be clear: this is not Uber. In fact, it’s not even close. Hochstedler doesn’t work for Uber. He charges a flat $5 for a ride. There are no other drivers in his company but him. There’s no app, no GPS and no other technology being used. You can’t even find him on your smartphone. If you want a ride you’re going to have to flag him down on the road and hope he’s available. In other words, this Amish entrepreneur is pretty much doing what many others of his like have been doing for centuries: offering buggy rides to wide-eyed tourists and other fascinated bystanders. Except he’s borrowed Uber’s name.And the customers love it! “First time Ubering and we’re riding in a buggy!” one Amish Uber rider said in the WMMT report. “It was fascinating,” said another. “It’s not an activity you typically associate with the Amish.” The customers aren’t the only ones gushing about Amish Uber either. The media has been covering the story like Donald Trump himself is driving the buggy. There are stories about Amish Uber everywhere.Regardless of whether the new venture is a prank or not (and it really could be) I still say: good for him. Premeditated or not, Hochstedler has stumbled on a marketing tactic that always has a decent chance of succeeding: just come up with a product or service that’s comparable to another well-known brand, create a similar name (be careful!) and hope people either confuse your product for the real thing or are so amused by your ingenuity that they buy from you anyway.It’s the copycat model and it’s all around us. Take a quick trip to your local grocery store and you’ll see laundry detergent boxes that look very similar to each other and crackers that are like the original, but aren’t. There are ketchup bottles that look like Heinz … but they’re not. There’s Dr Pepper … and Dr Publix (and Dr Browns too). There’s Pringles … and Chipz. There’s Nike … and, well a bunch of other knock-offs that try to be like Nike.Copycat brands are not a new thing. But are they a sustainable business model? One big downside of all the media attention about Amish Uber is that the attorneys at Uber are sure to have noticed Hochstedler by now and for all we know a cease and desist letter is already in the mail. Then again, it’s possible that Uber has bigger fish to fry and may not want any negative publicity from forcing a sweet Amish guy to shut down his business and therefore may just leave him alone.Regardless of what happens, just remember: this kind of marketing can be effective, but it can also be very risky. I may be enticed to try out a buggy ride with Amish Uber if I’m ever in Colon. But as a long-term business strategy I’m not sure I’m sold that this is the right direction for any entrepreneur."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a4e498cbf30fd9b39d83ec69ebd190b375204f2/0_74_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc6fd79fba2163a678da67f7a3f5eb2","title":"former co op director sam walker says sacked equal pay claim","story":"Exclusive: Sam Walker tells tribunal she warned of possible company-wide salary gapA former executive at the Co-operative Group claims she was sacked after raising an equal pay claim and warning that the company could be paying men and women differently for the same roles.Ex-HR director Sam Walker has brought a claim of equal pay, discrimination and unfair dismissal against the Co-op, which will be heard over the next two weeks.Giving evidence at an employment tribunal in Manchester on Tuesday, Walker said she was appointed chief HR officer in February 2014 when the Co-op was “in crisis”.In her witness statement, she said she first raised questions about equal pay in 2015 after comparing her salary to other male executives who sat alongside her on the board. She was sacked the following year.Andrew Burns QC, for the Co-op, suggested to Walker that she was “thrown into the deep end”. “I think anyone taking that job at the time was being thrown in the deep end because the business was in crisis,” she replied. She denied having been “parachuted” into the role and being out of her depth.Walker’s witness statement paints a picture of turmoil at the Co-op from 2013-14, with large salaries given to board members in a bid to stop them leaving. She said that in 2014 large increases were agreed for the then general counsel, Alistair Asher, and chief external affairs officer, Nick Folland, who were paid £550,000, while she and the then chief strategy planning officer, Paula Kerrigan, were offered £400,000 “ostensibly because we were newly promoted to our roles”.According to Walker’s lawyers, an independent assessment of executive roles by the Hay Group in January 2015 rated her higher than Asher and Folland, with Kerrigan’s role on a par with Asher and higher than Folland.Walker said that in 2016 she warned the then chief executive, Richard Pennycook, that following a new company-wide grading structure, women in general appeared to be paid less across the company.She said she was “not treated equally in terms of pay with two male colleagues in the Co-op’s executive team and that I was victimised and discriminated (and ultimately dismissed) when I raised concerns about this”.She added: “However, I do not see my case simply as being about my own position. Equal pay for women generally is a matter of real importance and concern to me. I am an active member of the Fawcett Society, and am committed to the promotion of transparency and fairness for women at work.”A Co-op spokesman said: “We do not accept that Sam Walker was discriminated against or treated detrimentally, and intend to fully and robustly defend the various claims brought by Sam.”Walker denied Burns’s suggestion that she had a “very bumpy” relationship with members of the Co-op board – who the tribunal heard had privately questioned her performance – saying only there were disagreements.The tribunal heard that senior executives had also questioned Walker’s performance over the progress of a huge IT project called 1HR, which Burns described as “over time and over budget”. The IT system was due to be implemented by 1 January 2016 but by October 2015 concerns were raised that it would not be ready on time, the tribunal heard. In her witness statement Walker said the company went through a regrading exercise of all staff and told Pennycook in 2016 it was “not looking good” from an equal pay perspective. She said: “I told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem which not only exposed the business to legal claims, but was inconsistent with the Co-op’s declared values.”Walker said she reminded him that she was, by then, the only woman on the executive committee and wanted to address what she saw as unequal pay. She said she proposed more holidays for herself so her “pro-rated pay could be equivalent to the men on the executive committee”.Her statement said Pennycook at first seemed open to the idea, and had told her that his wife had made the “tough decision” to step down as a partner at her GP practice and become a regular GP so she could spend more time with their children, and it was the best decision they had made as a family. Walker said: “I was shocked. I knew he meant well, but it was such old-fashioned and stereotypical thinking.”But Walker said that instead of accepting her proposal she was instead told she had to accept a new, reduced role. “I had thought I had found a solution that wouldn’t add cost to the company, and here I was, finding myself being demoted, suddenly deemed not to be performing and having the function I had built up over two years taken away from me and split up. The only reason I could think I was being treated in this way was because I had dared to raise the issue of equal pay.”During the negotiations her daughter, who is severely disabled, suffered a brain injury and Walker was signed off sick in March 2016. After an evaluation she was diagnosed with trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, and is now on medication. She was told her employment had been terminated at the start of April.Following her dismissal Walker submitted a grievance which was rejected by the Co-op non-executive director, Lord Victor Adebowale, a year later who found there was no suggestion of unreasonable discriminatory behaviour. Walker’s appeal of that decision was rejected.Walker argued in her statement that the case is not about money but “right and wrong”.“I’ve grown up in a man’s world, I’ve had a 28-year career with mainly just men around the table once I reached senior positions and all the time I have been conscious that they have been paid more. I cannot leave that career, which I now accept is damaged beyond repair by simply making this claim, without trying to put something right,” she said. “All the cases that come to court are class actions. The costs and the intimidation put iniduals off. It is a living hell.”Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society said the women’s rights charity stood “shoulder to shoulder” with Walker. “Women repeatedly suspect they are undervalued and underpaid. This is illegal but it is often impossible for iniduals to challenge without comparative pay data,” she said. “The system needs reform to provide real transparency and impose time limits on equal pay cases, which can drag on for years. Otherwise it will continue to operate in favour of employers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4786c0c393e2de3efb7ba2371c1059910d821c3b/0_0_3993_2396/master/3993.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a9758532d81968be25640e8dc9e8cc5","title":"mike ashley house of fraser stores open sports direct","story":"Sports Direct boss plans to bring in ‘cool brands’ after buying chain for £90mMike Ashley is hoping to keep 47 of 59 House of Fraser stores open, partly by turning over floors of larger shops to Sports Direct or his Flannels chain, it has emerged.“We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands.

This could be done through a a form of insolvency procedure known as company voluntary agreement (CVA).Byron: The troubled upmarket burger chain is closing up to 20 of its 67 restaurants after a CVA was agreed in January. Rent cuts have been agreed at a number of other locations.Carpetright: The retailer obtained a CVA in April to close 92 of its 409 UK stores in September with the loss of about 300 jobs.Jamie’s Italian: The chain closed six locations in 2017 and this year agreed a CVA to close about a third of its 35 loss-making outlets.Poundworld: The discount retailer is planning to close about 100 of its 355 stores, with the loss of about 1,500 jobs.Prezzo: In March the Italian-themed restaurant group secured a CVA to close 94 of its 300 restaurants, with the loss of 500 jobs.

It is in talks with its banks to secure new funding and rumoured to be considering a CVA to fast-track the store closures.Homebase: The DIY chain is in talks with potential buyers and also thought to be considering a CVA after a botched takeover by Australia’s Bunnings.Ashley said that in stores such as the one in Birmingham, whole floors could be turned over to Sports Direct under his strategy for the business, which he bought out of administration for £90m on Friday.Sports Direct is already in talks with landlords, via the advisory services company CBRE, about rent agreements that could mean 12 closures – fewer than the 31 planned by House of Fraser’s previous owners.Among the stores that could be saved is the Oxford Street flagship in London – if the right rental deal can be agreed.Ashley is running House of Fraser’s stores under licence from the company’s administrator, EY, so he is free to hand back the keys without penalty on any store he does not want.He is likely to have up to a year to arrange the reassignment of each lease and decide on the store’s future.While Ashley, and Sports Direct’s “head of elevation”, Michael Murray, the fiance of his daughter Anna, are expected to cut tough deals with landlords in the coming weeks, suppliers are having a much rougher ride.Sports Direct has written to suppliers, which were due to be paid this week, saying it would only pay them for money due after the administration. Suppliers, which are thought to be owed more than £60m, had hoped Ashley would honour their debts in the interests of good relations in the future.The £90m paid by Ashley went towards paying House of Fraser’s bondholders and banks, with other creditors not expected to receive more than 3p in the pound from administrators.One supplier told the : “It is very, very concerning. Ashley is trading the stores on the back of suppliers’ money. We were hoping he would give us back something.”Pensioners are also likely to lose out under the deal. The House of Fraser pension fund has not been taken on by Ashley and so will be assessed by the industry-funded lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund. It is likely to be sold to a specialist insurance fund, but the higher costs involved in that process mean the House of Fraser fund could be more than £160m in deficit, so members yet to draw a pension will not get their full benefits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4482a7690f179edd288910817eb13241ff38088/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2250f44bd672005caa4a673a876b873f","title":"turkey lira india rupee low emerging markets","story":"Fears over emerging markets’ currencies ease slightly amid financial crisis in TurkeyThe Turkish lira recovered some of its losses as India’s national currency became the latest focus of investors’ concerns over the strength of emerging economies.

Traders in Mumbai reported that the Indian central bank may have stepped in to stabilise the currency and it is now trading at 69.89 per dollar.Investors are also taking some comfort from news that Turkey’s finance minister, Berat Albayrak, will hold a conference call with investors from the US, Europe and the Middle East on Thursday, his first since assuming the post almost two months ago.

Working with  Cities to scale up the original survey using data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we broke the world’s cities into four categories.First, cities where you probably don\u0027t need either heating or air conditioning: average summer temperatures are shy of 26.5C (80F) and the hottest days are less than 28C (82F), while the winter average is no colder than 13C (55F) and the coldest days no less than 7C (45F). Second, cities that are warmer in the summer, meaning you probably want air conditioning but can still get by without heating. Third, the opposite: cold in winter, not too warm in summer. Lastly, cities with hot summers and cold winters, where you probably want both air conditioning and heating. The good news is that, if you want to go air conditioning-free, you have options on every single continent. The bad news is that this may not be the case forever. Using data from the Impact Climate Lab, we have modelled how climate change might affect temperatures globally, making more people dependent on air conditioning in cities where it is currently strictly a luxury.The two maps show how average summer temperatures are predicted to rapidly increase in both hemispheres over the next 40 years. In the northern hemisphere, hotter temperatures will creep towards the Arctic circle, while much of northern Africa and the Middle East will see average temperatures climb above 35C (95F) between June and August.In the southern hemisphere the hottest temperatures occur between December and February. In the next 20 years South American countries such as Argentina and Bolivia are forecast to have average summer temperatures above 35C for the first time since records began.Whether we face the challenge through international efforts, designing for cooler cities, or by moving to those cities that are naturally temperate, it’s clear we will all need to think more about heat in the coming century.Sources: US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Impact Lab"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden.

Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

History is women following behind with the bucket.”Hauling our citizens’ rights bucket around is unglamorous work that never gets the big headlines because it involves real people’s lives rather than seemingly intractable rows over borders and trade. The pro-Brexit press and politicians show no interest because we don’t fit their agenda, although they can’t say this overtly because we are claimed to be the reason why the rights of EU citizens in the UK are still not guaranteed. It’s telling that, along with our sister group the3million, our requests for meetings with Theresa May, the Brexit secretaries and the home secretary have gone unanswered – although Michel Barnier has met us twice.Throughout we have tried to remain neutral, patient and keep a sense of perspective. But now, faced with the prospect of either being sold out in a bad deal or the prospect of no deal at all, we can’t stay on the fence any longer.Let’s go back to the point of departure for all this. We were promised our lives would carry on exactly as normal after Brexit, first by Vote Leave then by both May and Michel Barnier. This is particularly important because, if you are going to exclude from voting the very people whose lives hang on the outcome of that vote, then you have an extra special duty of care to fight for them as hard as possible.Even if there is a deal, we cannot be said to have been a priority in the negotiations, in particular because May has not fought for our continuing right to free movement, which many of us rely on to provide for our families. Her negotiating position from the beginning has prioritised reducing the rights of EU citizens in the UK over supporting ours. So our rights will only be protected in the country where we live now – and even then, not all of them. This puts our livelihoods at risk. If you are a small-business owner like Helen, a British caterer who lives in France but makes half her income elsewhere, you won’t be able to take bookings in other EU countries at short notice, or maybe at all, because you’ll almost certainly need paperwork and, as we all know, paperwork takes time and clients don’t like to wait.In the no-deal scenario, Brits on the continent will be thrown into turmoil as they will lose their current legal status. We can only hope that an emergency deal will be made to maintain our status – or give us one that is not simply a default to being a third-country national, which is nothing like what we have now.If your view is, we’ll all lose rights, stop complaining, consider this: our personal limbo is also a political litmus test for the kind of future deals that the UK is prepared to fight for on behalf of its citizens. And if this is it, then things don’t look good for Brits in the UK itself, especially those who hoped Brexit would mean more control and a better quality of life.As children of the European project who have lived its benefits first-hand and know what future generations in the UK are set to lose – enough is enough. We have no choice but to accept that the only solution to protect our lives and livelihoods (and those of EU citizens in the UK), as well as those of all Brits in the UK, is to remain in the EU.That’s why we support a people’s vote and demand that the government deliver on its 2015 and 2017 manifesto commitments to give us back our vote and a say. If you’re going to make people reapply to live the lives they have built up through their own hard graft (on significantly worse terms than they currently have) then you owe them a vote. It’s not about sympathy or special treatment, it’s about finally having control over our own lives.• Jane Golding is chair of British in Europe, the largest coalition group of British citizens living and working in the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7a672a6fae9ffbd2d0ea38b188ad2ddd09faf8/0_176_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92dedf5b5c3294fc6bc168d75c83910e","title":"maurice film merchant ivory gay love relationships","story":"In 1987, Ismail Merchant and James Ivory’s film Maurice was released – their first film after A Room With a View. They were both adaptations of EM Forster novels. But if A Room With a View was sunny, romantic and charming, Maurice, by contrast, seemed darker, more brooding – and more, well, gay. In the film Maurice, played by James Wilby, and Clive (Hugh Grant), meet at Cambridge and are drawn together into a platonic relationship before Clive marries. Maurice, in a crisis of self-loathing, seeks a “cure” for his homosexuality, before falling in love with Clive’s gamekeeper, Scudder, played by Rupert Graves.The film – released the year before the introduction of section 28, and into the midst of the Aids crisis – was respectfully received but has never had anything like the popular, Middle England appeal of A Room With a View. It was characteristic of the time that interviews with its makers referred to the fact that Merchant and Ivory lived together without ever suggesting that they were, in fact, together.Maurice has just been rereleased in the UK, lavishly restored. Seen afresh, the film seems ahead of its time. Hollywood has still not caught up with its straightforward approach to male nudity, for instance: though the film is discreet on sex, it does allow the characters the dignity of moving around their bedrooms naked, rather than draped in strategically positioned sheets it also, crucially, has a happy ending, offering the lovers an escape into love and truth rather than “punishing” them for their sexuality. And, for anyone who is still surprised at how superb an actor Grant turned out to be in the BBC’s recent A Very British Scandal, Maurice makes instructive viewing. In his first film role, Grant’s performance is captivating.Ivory adapted the screenplay for the touching Call Me By Your Name, Luca Guadagnino’s film about a summer love affair between two young men. Those characters are untouched by the anguish that afflicts Maurice and Clive – no running away from the truth of the self, no spectre of prosecution but, rather, a delicate first love that flourishes over a long hot summer. But a more intriguing comparison might be with God’s Own Country, Francis Lee’s film – also from 2017 – about the connection that grows between Johnny, a young Yorkshire farmer and Gheorghe, a Romanian labourer who comes to help during lambing season. Johnny is effectively in charge of the farm and out of his depth his father has had a stroke his grandmother is doing her best but can offer Johnny little. After a hostile beginning between the two young men, Gheorghe teaches Johnny the kind of tenderness that has been dormant, at best, within his taciturn family.As in Maurice, the family house itself plays a profound role. In the Merchant Ivory film, Clive’s eventual marital dwelling – where Maurice is invited to stay, and where he will eventually be found and loved by Scudder – is leaky and dilapidated, a reflection of Clive’s vulnerability despite his attempts to construct a watertight, conventional life. The final, desperately sad scene shows Clive shuttering the windows of his bedroom – both blotting out the threatening wildness of the world beyond, and imprisoning himself in a hypocritical marriage (the imagery is neatly borrowed from the novel).In God’s Own Country, the film begins with the house seen in a bleak, grey dawn, a single light burning, as if to draw attention to Johnny’s profound aloneness. In Maurice, the gay lovers must find a life beyond conventional understandings of domesticity. But in God’s Own Country, there is something new: the integrity of the traditional household, threatened at the start of the film, can be renewed only by Johnny and Gheorghe together – through their partnership as farmers, and as lovers. The film ends not with a lonely man shuttering himself in, but with two men, arm in arm, walking through the door of their home. And the most quietly radical fact about that may not be that Johnny and Gheorghe are gay – but rather than Gheorghe is a Romanian immigrant. In these days of Brexit, God’s Own Country may be teaching us EM Forster’s adage – “only connect” – in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af18f1479d0d3c388b0fa27c0b6095c0fcbe6196/0_293_4399_2640/master/4399.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf3503b4a5c398904d8501830885c60f","title":"view the fat museum of london launches live stream of fatberg","story":"Those interested in mass of oils and wet wipes can now watch a sample of it sweat and growThose who wish to watch the slow sweating of a disgusting, calcified mass of faeces, fats, oils, wet wipes and sanitary products can now do so at the click of a mouse.The Museum of London announced on Tuesday that it had permanently acquired samples of fatbergs and would livestream them to the world.The samples, said to smell like dirty toilets, were once part of a fatberg discovered blocking sewers under Whitechapel in September.They went on temporary display at the museum in February and became a surprise hit with visitors, who were fascinated and nauseated in equal measure.Curators said the fatberg had hatched flies, sweated and changed colour while on display. Since being removed on 1 July, the fatberg has grown an unusual toxic mould in the form of visible yellow pustules.Vyki Sparkes, the curator of social and working history at the museum, said the livestream meant the fatberg samples could entertain and educate people around the world.“The samples of the Whitechapel fatberg have proven to be very powerful museum objects, provoking strong feelings of fascination and disgust in our visitors while encouraging them to reflect on a serious challenge facing the city,” she said. “Fatbergs are created by people and businesses who discard fat and rubbish into our historic sewer system. By adding these samples to our permanent collections, we are preserving material evidence of how we live now and, as we change our habits and attitudes, fatbergs could well become history.”Sharon Robinson-Calver, the head of conservation and collection care at the museum, said the fatberg was unlike any material it had dealt with before.“Since going off display, the fatberg has started to grow visible mould, which we have identified as aspergillus,” she said, explaining that the fatberg remained a live experiment.“We believe this started while the fatberg was on display and we’re currently monitoring the mould and working to control it.”There were two cases of fatberg samples on display at the museum, with the larger one being about the size of a shoebox. Sticking out from it was a purple and orange tag, identified by researchers as a Double Decker chocolate wrapper.They were taken from a fatberg that weighed 130 tonnes, the equivalent of 11 double-decker buses, and was 250m long – 6m longer than Tower Bridge.The free display proved popular with visitors, with merchandise including T-shirts, tote bags and fatberg fudge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be21e4cb66cfa11c9dd2943679c30f9c778eb412/0_64_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63920c13529a9cb788e34c8b416669c7","title":"freshwater jellyfish spotted shropshire canal","story":"First UK sighting of tiny jellyfish species normally found in the Yangtze basin in ChinaFirst came the wasps, exotic sharks and marauding seagulls. Now the long hot summer has revealed another initially alarm-inducing animal in British waters – or more precisely, in the Middlewich branch of the Shropshire Union Canal.Freshwater jellyfish more normally found in the Yangtze basin in China have been spotted swimming in the waters near Bridge 23 of the canal between Middlewich and Winsford, according to the Canal \u0026amp River Trust.The jellyfish, Craspedacusta sowerbii, is transparent, the size of a 10p coin, and completely harmless to humans. It has never been recorded before in the charity’s 2,000 miles of canals and rivers.Sara Hill, an ecologist at the trust, said: “It’s a really unusual sight. We’re used to seeing all sorts of fish, birds and insects here in Middlewich, but jellyfish are a first and certainly make an interesting addition to the local wildlife.“It’s thought that the hot and sunny weather could have encouraged the jellyfish to these parts and created perfect conditions for them, but we don’t know whether they will make their permanent home here so we’re finding out as much as we can.”The jellyfish prefer standing water and feed on tiny organisms which they catch with their stinging tentacles, but are so small that they do not pose any danger to people.The hot weather warming the canal waters may have encouraged the species at a particular stage of its lifecycle so the canal population has become visible for the first time, but ecologists are not sure if they will become a permanent feature of the waterways.Gemma Rathbone, spokesperson for the Canal \u0026amp River Trust, said: “It’s now pretty grey and drizzly up here so whether that will put them off, we don’t know.”Freshwater jellyfish have spread to every continent from their natural home in the Yangtze basin in China. They are believed to have arrived in Britain in the 19th century when explorers brought back exotic flora and fauna from their travels around the world.A different species of jellyfish has also been found in the waters of Liverpool’s South Docks, which is also managed by the trust. They enter from the adjoining River Mersey and have been spotted along the Leeds \u0026amp Liverpool Canal.Earlier this summer, thousands of moon jellyfish were spotted off the Welsh coast, with hundreds then washing onto beaches near Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b2a4d62728a97303be619e5d879bdebb7c804a/43_0_1281_769/master/1281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00fcbd6c18b08b541978d5370551b878","title":"the festival review joe thomas iain morris inbetweeners","story":"The Inbetweeners’ Joe Thomas crowdsurfs a weekend of misadventures and self-abasing nudity in Iain Morris’s likable comedyDirector Iain Morris first enlivened this quiet-to-dead corner of the cinematic silly season with the astonishingly successful Inbetweeners diptych. Having packed those boys off with a happy ending (stop sniggering), he now attempts something only slightly different: bussing Joe Thomas – perhaps the most immediately available ’Tweener – and a grab bag of emergent talent to the Leeds music festival to recreate this muddily parochial rite-of-passage for an audience too young, too late or too worldly-wise to snap up day passes for this year’s festivities. Chasing the youth pound this flagrantly is always a risk, as those who suffered The Bad Education Movie can attest, yet The Festival’s pursuit remains broadly likable, and Morris again backs it up with real comedy nous.This film-maker is now so confident that he can toss off a genre-regulation misdirected-ejaculate gag within the first two minutes – what we might call a coarse record. Nudging Thomas’s twerpish Nick towards self-knowledge after a graduation humiliation is the main event, but The Festival gets there by deploying disparate, sometimes random, mostly winning ideas (jolly druids!). Morris has a knack of pushing a joke just far enough that the stretching itself becomes funny. Disproportionately devoted dad Jemaine Clement performs an agonising three-point turn to the strains of Crowded House Theo Barklem-Biggs’ arch-caner Gordy does one big ketamine hit, then spends the rest of the film yammering in holes.If The Festival’s framing still resembles an extended E4 special – drizzly medium shots predominate, distinguishing the British festival experience from ultra-glam Coachella – the consolation is that it fills the screen with people you’d happily share a yurt with. Thomas, who spent the entire Inbetweeners project quietly mastering the playing of sexual frustration, deserves the Robin Askwith prize for self-abasing nudity. He builds a nice, easy double act with baffled wingman Hammed Animashaun, particularly when replaying Magic Mike with wellies and Claudia O’Doherty, whose spacey-perky rhythms elevated Judd Apatow’s Netflix series Love, is a genuine ray of sunshine as a fellow traveller the pair encounter en route. Very soon, O’Doherty will be the headline act in comedies like these, but this good-natured crowdpleaser generously lets her steal whole stretches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b16c0c7802dd01f1a2136c3783c4aacbf487db/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=661e0e116041ffab4c0351b9d5f8ae9e","title":"chelsea milan tiemoue bakayoko transfers loan","story":"The Chelsea midfielder Tiémoué Bakayoko has completed a season-long loan move to Milan.The deal for Bakayoko, who joined Chelsea from Monaco last summer for £39.7m, could be turned into a permanent move for a fee in the region of £35m.The France international made 43 appearances for Chelsea last season, scoring three goals, and was in the starting XI for the 1-0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final.Chelsea have signed the midfielders Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic this summer from Napoli and Real Madrid respectively.

With the side unbeaten in all competitions and two points ahead of Chelsea, their nearest rivals, the prospect of finishing the season empty-handed seemed almost laughable. Yet as the curtain fell, the humbled club were without silverware.Between January and May the 2016 WSL1 champions lost to Arsenal in the Continental Cup final, were knocked out of the FA Cup semi-finals by Chelsea, suffered a narrow defeat by Lyon in the Champions League and were beaten four times in the league.Now their manager, Nick Cushing, is preparing to enter the restructured fully professional top tier and says the task has only got harder.“We know that we have no ine right to win,” he says before Manchester City’s season opener against Birmingham in the Continental Cup on Sunday. “When we won in 2016 we didn’t think we would now become the dominant team. We knew we’d need to work to continue to be successful.“We’re realistic. Every year every team is getting better and better. Chelsea are probably setting the standard and everyone else is pushing hard to follow.”While Cushing is keen to stress that last season had its pluses he also says there are many lessons to be learned from the way the team slipped away. “We were really pleased with the first three-quarters of the season, not to say we weren’t pleased with the end. There were many positives from our season last year.“But we have to be realistic. We’ve been a team for five years now and every year we’ve learnt a lot about ourselves. Last year we learnt an incredible amount about where we are as a team, what we do really well and where we need to improve.”The depth of Cushing’s squad was questioned as the team fell behind. Chelsea’s manager, Emma Hayes, was able to rotate and tinker with a squad packed with experience to deal with the demanding new schedule of a winter season. However, a spate of injuries – both short- and long-term – left Cushing’s young squad increasingly exposed.The manager points to the seasonal switch as part of the problem but equally does not shy away from the fact that the depth of the squad needed consideration at the season’s close. “Listen, people will always question the teams that don’t win because ultimately the standard is set by the teams that win, I get that,” he says.“Maybe we learnt a little bit about the season last year, changing to a winter season meant we played Champions League football within our season which meant that we played an extra eight to 10 games than we did the year before. So yes, squad depth is definitely something we’ve reflected on and acted on.”This summer he has recruited to bolster the areas shown to be weakest in the previous campaign. He has brought in the outstanding 17-year-old Lauren Hemp from Bristol City – who has four goals in three games at the ongoing Under-20 World Cup – alongside more experienced players such as the Liverpool captain, Gemma Bonner, the forward Caroline Weir, Wolfsburg’s Tessa Wullaert and the Canadian forward Janine Beckie from Sky Blue FC.“We’ve acted on different areas where we feel we may have lost physical fitness and freshness,” reflects Cushing. “Because not only did we play 40-plus games last year. Our players also played every international fixture.“I’ve said from 2014, we’ll always support our players internationally because that’s what we do here. Some could say to the detriment of our season last year with the Continental Cup final and the FA Cup semi-final falling right off the back of international windows and us having 17-18 players away. Maybe our preparation was affected and we’ve reflected on that as well.”The Blues have born the brunt of their players’ success internationally. Last year they lost the right-back Lucy Bronze to the five-times Champions League winners Lyon and Toni Duggan to Barcelona. This summer Izzy Christiansen, one of their best players last season, has teamed up with Bronze in France, while the Danish forward Nadia Nadim announced in July that she had submitted a transfer request. Cushing says there is no update, though the player’s agent has told the Danish newspaper BT that she will be staying in Manchester.“The evolution of football teams means that players will come and go. We’re really pleased with who’s come in. People can see players wanting to leave and further their careers but we’ve just signed a player from Wolfsburg, a European powerhouse, and she’s decided to come to Man City.“Players will come and go, the art of it is trying to make sure that when you’re recruiting players you’re recruiting the right players for the team and the right players for the style of football we want to be playing.”The way City play is important to Cushing, because for him, and the club, the project is about more than silverware: “I think people have seen that we’ve tried to evolve it over the years. We want to make sure we entertain our fans.“We want to be successful but we have a greater goal of trying to develop Manchester City Women, to develop the women’s game and to fill our stadium with fans that enjoy coming and watching us.”• After last weekend’s thrilling 3-1 win against the current Under-20 World Cup champions, North Korea, the young Lionesses went on to top Group B and secure a place in the quarter-finals. A Georgia Stanway penalty put England in the driving seat against Brazil but an injury time goal from Ariadina left them needing a win against Mexico to clinch the top spot. Jacqueline Ovalle put the Mexicans ahead in the 37th minute but a blistering second half saw England score six goals in half an hour, with Hemp completing a hat-trick in the 80th minute. England will play the Netherlands in the last eight.• Goals from Lindsey Horan – her 11th of the season – and Hayley Raso secured a 2-0 win for Portland Thorns against Orlando Pride and lifted them above their opponents, into third, as the race for the top-four play-off spot heats up. Seattle Reign stayed second as a 48th-minute header from the Welsh striker Jess Fishlock saw off Utah Royals and maintained a four-point gap over the chasing Thorns.• Arsenal drew 2-2 with PSG to win the friendly Toulouse International Ladies Cup. Goals from Beth Mead and Kim Little put the Gunners ahead twice before Melike Pekel pounced in injury time to level the match. Arsenal had previously beaten Montpellier 2-1.• Manchester City handed debuts to Wullaert, Weir and Bonner as they beat Barcelona 2-0 in a pre-season friendly. The breakthrough was made with 15 minutes left, Mel Lawley slotting home to give City the lead before Nikita Parris scored the second from the penalty spot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9baba4b717706a977b47379e03091f1e993774fd/46_239_1083_650/master/1083.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6154f8dcb8bfb711c34f3632f8e1a805","title":"how to feed the world inside brazils food security conference sponsored by pesticide manufacturer","story":"Agriculture startups from around the world gathered at a vibrant conference sponsored by pesticide manufacturerAs confetti showers a theatre inside Rio de Janeiro’s normally sedate Museum of Tomorrow, electronic pop music pounds and dozens of young people crowd the stage to dance enthusiastically, hugging each other and waving flags as their audience films the festivities on their phones.But this is not a religious event, or a disco. It’s an unusual conference that has attracted several hundred young people from across the world to pitch and discuss ideas on how to feed the world’s booming population with agriculture startups – and make their fortunes doing so.“I didn’t know it was possible to create a business that can make an impact and make money,” Mariana Vasconcellos, who runs a successful “digital agriculture platform” called Agrosmart, tells the audience.

Instead, buzzwords like “digital agriculture”, “vertical farming” and “multi-sectoral thinking” ricochet around the museum’s white walls as attendees zap contact details to each other’s phones or duck into a virtual reality setup in a cardboard igloo to share dreams and memories.Delegates attend workshops, such as agroforestry training offered by reNature, a startup launched last year by Brazilian agronomist Felipe Villela and Dutch advertising executive Marco de Boer after they met at last year’s Thought for Food in Amsterdam.Estela Camargo, 28, from São Paulo, attended the agroforestry workshop and learned about planting crops within existing eco-systems, rather than cutting them down. “You have to return resources to the land. It’s not enough to be organic,” says Camargo, who was so inspired by the workshop she is now considering swapping customer services for sustainable farming.Other startups compete for prize money and, after a “slam poet” performs over music by Pink Floyd, teams jog on to the stage as the audience whoops. Host Holley M Murchison – whose website describes her as a “dreamer and a purpose-driven doer” – asks the crowd: “Can you take some of this energy home with you?”A Kenyan startup called Safi Organics wins $5,000 (£4,388) for a decentralised, organic fertiliser production system. Britain’s Aeropowder gets $5,000 for its scheme to make insulation out of poultry feathers. “This is a replacement for polystyrene,” says founder Ryan Robinson, 30. In the future, it will decompose “in something like compost”, he explains.The grand prize of $10,000 is won by Coating+, a startup from four Nigerian biochemists, who developed a spray to preserve fresh produce made of chitosan, a fibrous substance extracted from shellfish, and soy protein that they say is full of micronutrients.The aim is to cut food waste to feed those in need, says Albert Kure, 26, one of its co-founders. “It’s a new market,” he says.Thought for Food founder and CEO Christine Gould says the conference, held at the end of July, is for young people to share skills and ideas.“There’s a lot of similar businesses that are trying to do the same thing in different parts of the world and TFF gives them the chance to share knowledge and learnings,” she says, after dancing centre stage in trainers equipped with flashing lights. The conference has a party atmosphere because things are “very bleak for young people around the world and so this is a moment they can get motivated and inspired”.Before setting up Thought For Food in 2013, Gould worked at Syngenta for nearly 10 years. She says she is “agnostic” on the subject of pesticides.“We are not advocating a particular point of view or solution. We are bringing together erse points of view and stakeholders,” she says. “I personally have a very pro-science viewpoint but I empathise with people who don’t.”Syngenta’s presence is low-key but marked. Ariadne Caballero, who runs its digital agriculture in Brazil, tells delegates to amass practical experience. “Get your boots dirty, guys,” she says.Syngenta’s global strategy lead Steven Wall helps run a workshop in which delegates propose ideas to help smallholder farmers improve their businesses. One group sketches out an app to help them, not realising that many of Brazil’s rural areas lack mobile signals.“We have a lot of different projects going on all over with the world with different smallholders, trying to create new businesses with them,” Wall explains.Pesticide safety is part of his job, but Wall declines to discuss a controversial bill the Brazilian congress is discussing to lift restrictions on pesticides. The bill, dubbed the “poison package” by environmentalists, was approved by a Congress commission in June but has yet to be voted on.“Countries tend to have different views on how much regulation is necessary,” he says. As for Brazil: “It’s a really big market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/789e525ab5b597e8e0fce772a481d0b5dcc75112/0_2335_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70e5edc2bf940ebee1c96914ad24a19e","title":"nigel slater gnocchi with tomatoes recipe midweek supper","story":"A quick and simple supper that works as well when it’s hot or coldBring a deep pan of salted water to the boil.

The Berlin club night that shares his name channelled the power of this ancient mythology at its genesis in 2012, and today, the party series and record label has become a self-fulfilled prophecy: drawing from the past, while eyeing the future.Founded by Dan DeNorch and Michael Ladner, the Janus collective began as a protean dancefloor experiment, daring to ricochet between bawdy top 40 edits and frenetic rhythmic heaters, and has grown into one of the city’s most transgressive tastemakers. “We were trying to create a combination of artists that have an interesting kind of resonance between them – not necessarily tied to this canonical, genre-oriented thing,” says James Whipple, AKA resident artist M.E.S.H. When Janus began, electronic music had entered a glossy, commercialised era, churning out bombastic EDM hits with money-grabbing hubris. Underground parties in Berlin kept their subcultures segmented by booking eclectic acts. Cutting a swathe through hip-hop, grime instrumentals, baile funk, four-on-the-floor, and sound collaging everything in between, Janus rejected a singular aesthetic, allowing its artists free reign over their sets on one condition: they deliver each tonal exercise with visceral, emotional intensity.Whipple says they want a “stage and platform where multiple voices can be heard … But in a way that’s not prescribed and cheesy and moralistic. It’s still anarchy and it’s still hedonism.” His sets pivot around a techno-reminiscent 44 pattern however, it’s about “having more impactful moments, breakdowns, and silence” and “being rough with the way you play it”, a style of mixing the residents have taken on in earnest.Janus’s 53rd party took place at witching hour on a Friday in July. Stained in crimson light and staked through the heart by concrete pillars, its home venue, Säule, the experimental offspring of the superclub Berghain, has the same stern authority as its parent (and also doesn’t allow photos, hence the lack of them here). Billowy black clothing appears to be the crowd consensus, as is a shaved head. The party moved here, into the Friedrichshain neighbourhood, from its original stomping ground at the repurposed sex club Chesters in Kreuzberg, a place Whipple speculates was a filming location for swingers’ pornography. He and Tobias, alongside fellow resident DJs and expats Lotic and Kablam, played there monthly to a young art crowd, alongside showcase acts such as LA rabble-rouser Total Freedom, Lisbon’s kuduro crew Príncipe Discos, and Hyperdub kingpin Kode9. After closing Chesters at 10am, they would often slink over to Berghain to party until 2pm.Janus’s narrative would not be the same without Berghain, which is classed as a high-cultural institution by the German government. At a time when major cities often criminalise nightlife, this stamp of approval is unparalleled to Tobias, Janus’s new affiliate was an unforeseen validation. “I thought Berghain was such a specific and tight old-school thing. They were never going to let us idiots in there,” he jokes. “The day that became a thing, I thought: OK, that’s the ultimate.”Lee and Whipple view Janus as a natural outgrowth of Berlin’s nocturnal traditions. The city’s techno tourism has allowed the night to ascend into the electronic music vanguard. On any given day, there are hordes of international thrillseekers eager to check their inhibitions at the door. “Creatively and artistically, there’s this infrastructure here for club music – part of the marketing of the city is to get people to travel here and go clubbing,” Whipple says, describing how Janus gained momentum. “If you do something quite random or experimental, you’ll still get a pretty sizeable crowd just because there are so many people going out.”As per usual, gatekeepers are stationed on either side of Säule’s entrance. Two men in tight black T-shirts amble their way to the metal-framed doorway before a silent headshake has them retracing their steps in swift departure. The shorter of the duo turns around for one last appeal. “It would be a real, real honour for us to come in,” he pleads. “Sorry, not tonight,” the bouncer responds. Anticipation of the unknown proves endlessly compelling. Meanwhile, through the tenebrous interior, that elusive Janus sound blares louder.M.E.S.H.: “Primitive Art are an Italian band who have played Janus a few times. They are connected with Club Adriatico, a like-minded party in Ravenna. They have a kind of industrialised take on dub and are amazing live. They just put out a new EP on Arcola.”M.E.S.H.: “Kablam is a Janus resident and one of the hardest producers I know. Her tracks always seem harsh at home, and then you play them in a club and they turn into something really heavy and transfixing. Raw energy. Her release Furiosa was really influential I think.”Why Be: “Craxxxmurf is very Janus, whether he likes that or not, and has played a handful of events – he’s an amazing artist.”M.E.S.H.: “A track off Why Be’s Snipestreet EP, flipped with a Tink edit from the producer Mistress. I heard this edit of an edit all over the world a couple years ago. Why Be has been putting out music for a long time, ranging from very aggro club tracks to chamber music, since way before all of this kicked off. An artist who honed the ability to be rough with samples, while still creating a really focused and intense dancefloor energy.”Why Be: “A timeless and unbothered genius. Hvad played the first and the most recent Berghain event and has been the main reason why I ended up doing what I’m doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e04c212725fc71bcb17082aef23b0e1ced240e44/0_44_4804_2883/master/4804.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c89dd3c52240b9808e939d5e645b2f92","title":"bds boycott divestment sanctions movement transformed israeli palestinian debate","story":"Israel sees the international boycott campaign as an existential threat to the Jewish state. Palestinians regard it as their last resort. The movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel – known as BDS – has been driving the world a little bit mad. Since its founding 13 years ago, it has acquired nearly as many enemies as the Israelis and Palestinians combined. It has hindered the efforts of Arab states to fully break their own decades-old boycott in pursuit of increasingly overt cooperation with Israel. It has shamed the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah by denouncing its security and economic collaboration with Israel’s army and military administration. It has annoyed the Palestine Liberation Organization by encroaching on its position as the internationally recognised advocate and representative of Palestinians worldwide.It has infuriated the Israeli government by trying to turn it into a leper among liberals and progressives. It has exasperated what is left of the Israeli peace camp by nudging the Palestinians away from an anti-occupation struggle and towards an anti-apartheid one. It has induced such an anti-democratic counter-campaign by the Israeli government that it has made Israeli liberals fear for the future of their country. And it has caused major headaches for the Palestinians’ donor governments in Europe, which are pressured by Israel not to work with BDS-supporting organisations in the Palestinian territories, an impossible request given that nearly all major civil society groups in Gaza and the West Bank support the movement.In an era of corporate social responsibility, BDS has given bad publicity to major businesses tied up in Israel’s occupation (Airbnb, ReMax, HP) and helped push other large firms out of the West Bank. It has disrupted film festivals, concerts and exhibitions around the world. It has riled academic and sports organisations by politicising them, demanding that they take a stand on the highly isive conflict. It has angered Palestinian performers and artists who work with Israeli institutions, accusing them of giving Palestinian cover for Israel’s human rights violations.In the UK, BDS has brought turmoil to courts and local councils, embroiling them in disputes over the legality of local boycotts of settlement goods. In the US, BDS has caused two dozen states to pass bills or issue orders inhibiting or penalising those boycotting Israel or its settlements, pitting Israel’s allies against free speech advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union. It has ignited debates in Protestant churches in the US, some of the largest of which have ested from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation. It has become the bane of college administrators, forced to adjudicate complaints from BDS-supporting professors and students that their free speech has been stifled, and claims by Zionist faculty, donors and undergraduates that their campuses have become “unsafe” spaces. It has pulled liberals toward greater support for the Palestinians, making Israel an increasingly partisan issue in the US, associated less with Democrats and progressives than with Trump, evangelicals and the far right.In the Jewish diaspora, BDS has created new schisms on the centre-left, which has been forced into a vice by the rightwing and pro-settlement Israeli government on one hand, and the non-Zionist left on the other. It has prompted liberal Zionists to grapple with why they sometimes accept the boycott of products from settlements but not the boycott of the state that creates and sustains them. It has compelled Israel’s more critical supporters to justify their opposition to non-violent forms of pressure on Israel, when the absence of real pressure has done nothing to bring occupation or settlement expansion to an end. It has put the onus on liberal Zionists to defend their support not for the abstract ideal of what they hope Israel might one day become, but for the actual, longstanding practices of the state, including expropriations of Palestinian land for Jewish settlement detention of hundreds of Palestinians without trial or charge collective punishment of two million Gazans living under a more than decade-long blockade and institutionalised inequality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. BDS has deprived Israel’s liberal supporters of the excuse that an aberrant occupation or rightwing governments are mainly to blame for the state’s undemocratic practices.Perhaps most significantly, BDS has challenged the two-state consensus of the international community. In so doing it has upset the entire industry of Middle East peace process nonprofit organisations, diplomatic missions and think tanks by undermining their central premise: that the conflict can be resolved simply by ending Israel’s occupation of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, leaving the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel and refugees unaddressed.For many diaspora Jews, BDS has become a symbol of evil and repository of dread, a nefarious force transforming the Israel-Palestine debate from a negotiation over the end of the occupation and the ision of territory into an argument about the conflict’s older and deeper roots: the original displacement of most of the Palestinians, and, on the ruins of their conquered villages, the establishment of a Jewish state. The emergence of the BDS movement has revived old questions about the legitimacy of Zionism, how to justify the privileging of Jewish over non-Jewish rights, and why refugees can return to their homes in other conflicts but not in this one. Above all, it has underscored an awkward issue that cannot be indefinitely neglected: whether Israel, even if it were to cease its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, can be both a democracy and a Jewish state.In the Old City of Bethlehem, down an arched pathway near the souk and Manger Square, there stands a centuries-old limestone building that now serves as the headquarters of Holy Land Trust, a Palestinian organisation devoted to nonviolent resistance to Israeli rule. Sami Awad, the non-profit’s founder, has an office on the top floor lining his shelves are books by leading theorists and practitioners of protest and civil disobedience: Gene Sharp, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr, all of whom figure prominently in his teaching, writing and even casual speech.Awad meets often with delegations of Israeli and American Jews unlike many Palestinian activists, he does not shy from discussing the Jewish connection to this land: “I can deny it till kingdom come. But it’s very deep and very emotional.” At the same time, he speaks candidly of occupation and racism, and he insists that Israel will not give Palestinians freedom unless forced to. “No oppressor group ever decides on their own just to be morally correct and change their behaviour,” he told me. “Something needs to happen: activism, resistance, boycott.”Jews and Arabs have been boycotting one another since the early days of Zionism. In the decades before Israel’s founding, the mainstream Zionist movement waged campaigns to boycott Arab workers, reject Arab produce, exclude Arabs from Jewish-only residential communities and forbid Arab purchase of Jewish-owned land. The fifth Palestine Arab Congress called for a boycott of Jewish goods in 1922. After Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Palestinian lawyers boycotted Israeli courts, and teachers went on strike under the slogan, “no education under occupation”. Israel responded to these and other acts of civil disobedience with arrests, fines, travel restrictions, shop closures, curfews and deportations of teachers, lawyers, mayors and university presidents.Sami’s uncle, Mubarak Awad, was a pioneer of Palestinian nonviolent resistance in the 1980s: Mubarak encouraged Palestinians to send back bills written solely in Hebrew, to refuse court summonses and to fly the Palestinian flag, which was cause for arrest. Inspired by Gandhi’s boycott of British cloth, he urged the replacement of Israeli products with Palestinian ones.But it wasn’t until the first intifada, the popular uprising against occupation that began in 1987, that the programme Mubarak and others advocated found its chance for full expression. Tactics he had championed in small classrooms and academic journals were now put into widespread use by a popular movement backed by major political parties: consumers boycotted Israeli goods and services, labourers in Israeli industries refused to work, shops closed down in unison, customers withdrew funds from Israeli banks, residents refused to pay taxes and most of the Palestinian tax collectors and police resigned. The Bank of Israel reported that the Palestinian boycott had cost Israel $650m ($1.4bn today) during the first year of the uprising alone. Mubarak was charged with “fomenting a rebellion against the state” like dozens of others, he was deported by Israel during the first year of the intifada.Sami Awad was sent by his parents to Kansas in order to continue his studies. When he returned to Bethlehem in 1996, it had been transformed by the Oslo peace process. Tens of thousands of PLO officials and fighters had moved from exile in the Arab world to the West Bank and Gaza, and were now functionaries in the newly established Palestinian administration. A culture of resistance had been replaced by one of coexistence. A peace industry now flourished, as foreign funds flowed in to finance dialogue groups, NGOs and people-to-people initiatives. Awad, like most Palestinians, was optimistic that peace was on the horizon.When the second intifada erupted, in September 2000, with Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli invasions and missile attacks, the dialogue and peacemaking activities of groups such as Holy Land Trust came to a halt. For Awad, the focus was now on nonviolent resistance, which was then neither popular nor simple. It was the bloodiest period of Israeli-Palestinian fighting since the 1948 war. More than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were killed. The militarisation of the intifada had made it dangerous to confront Israel in any manner, including peacefully.As the violence of the second intifada escalated, a campaign of international solidarity with Palestinians grew. In the first months of the uprising, students at the University of California in Berkeley erected mock checkpoints and brandished banners calling to “Divest from Israeli Apartheid”. Harvard faculty signed a estment petition in 2002. In Durban, South Africa, alongside a contentious UN-sponsored World Conference Against Racism, representatives of some 3,000 NGOs called on “the international community to impose a policy of complete and total isolation of Israel as an apartheid state”. Boycott and estment campaigns spread across US, UK and European campuses, gaining the support of several Israeli academics and large numbers of Palestinians.In the West Bank and Gaza, international and Israeli activists streamed in to offer their support. Their presence tended to make the Israeli army act more cautiously, which provided a measure of protection to Palestinian demonstrators. Awad still worked with Israelis, but now insisted that any cooperation be premised not on coexistence but co-resistance, with Palestinians in the lead. He was tear-gassed, beaten and detained alongside members of direct action groups such as the International Solidarity Movement, Christian Peacemaker Teams and the Israeli-led Anarchists Against the Wall.After a week or more among Palestinian villagers, the foreign activists would return to their campuses, church groups and labour unions, explaining that there was a little-noticed Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement – and that it could be supported through estment and boycott. The first estment by a US institution of higher education, Hampshire College – also the first US school to have ested from South Africa – was spearheaded by an Israeli undergraduate named Matan Cohen, who at 17 had been shot in the eye by Israeli forces during a demonstration against the separation barrier. The nonviolent activism of the second intifada was a prelude to what would become a worldwide boycott campaign.The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement was founded with a statement of principles, known as the BDS call, on 9 July 2005. It represented something of a last resort. The Palestinians had been crushed by the military defeat of the second intifada. The living embodiment of the Palestinian national movement, Yasser Arafat, was dead. His newly installed replacement, Mahmoud Abbas, was identified more than any other Palestinian with the Oslo peace process. Though Abbas’s leadership seemed to offer a respite from the violence, it also promised a return to a strategy of diplomacy and cooperation that had done little to bring occupation to an end. If there was going to be pressure on Israel to give Palestinians freedom, it was going to have to come from the grassroots and the outside.The BDS call was made on the one-year anniversary of a historic advisory opinion by the international court of justice. The court ruled that Israel’s separation barrier was illegal, that Israel had to dismantle it “forthwith” and offer reparations to those it had harmed, and that every signatory to the fourth Geneva convention – meaning nearly every state in the world – was under an obligation to ensure Israel complied with international humanitarian law. But Israel ignored the ruling, and neither the PLO nor the international community made a real attempt to enforce the court’s findings. “If there had been action on the part of the international community to implement the ICJ ruling,” Ingrid Jaradat, a founding member of the BDS campaign, told me, “there wouldn’t have been a BDS call.”More than 170 Palestinian organisations from the occupied territories, Israel and the diaspora endorsed the BDS call. They ned the political spectrum – leftists and Islamists, supporters of two states and of one. They included the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces – the coordinating body for every significant political party – as well as major trade unions, refugee camp committees, prisoners’ societies, artistic and cultural centres and nonviolent resistance groups, among them Sami Awad’s Holy Land Trust. Twenty-nine of these entities now form the BDS National Committee, or BNC, a leadership council.The chief innovation of the BDS call was not in the tactics that it advocated: boycott and estment campaigns were already pervasive in 2005, and even sanctions and arms embargoes had been proposed previously, including by the UN general assembly. What was new about BDS was that it took disparate campaigns to pressure Israel and united them around three clear demands, with one for each major component of the Palestinian people. First, freedom for the residents of the occupied territories second, equality for the Palestinian citizens of Israel and third, justice for Palestinian refugees in the diaspora – the largest group – including the right to return to their homes.During negotiations with Israel, the PLO had agreed to each of these concessions, though few if any of them were supported by international law. When even these accommodations eventually proved insufficient to obtain an end to the occupation, growing numbers of Palestinians started to sour on the idea of two states. It wasn’t simply that the original two-state compromise had been eroded to the point of unrecognisability. It was that even the whittled-down version now seemed like a mirage.At the time of the BDS call, Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza was nearly four decades old, and showed no signs of disappearing. The number of settlers had nearly doubled since Oslo, reaching almost half a million in 2005. Many of them resided not in hilltop caravans, but in cities with shopping malls, parks, public pools and multi-lane highways connecting them seamlessly to Israel. The idea of removing even a third of this steadily growing population had come to sound implausible. The US and other powers did little more than wag their fingers. They promised the Palestinians that the situation would soon end with the founding of an independent state.Over time, the two-state solution became a slogan emptied of meaning. The less plausible it seemed, the louder it was proclaimed. But so long as it could still be imagined, the major world powers refused to demand that Israel grant the Palestinians citizenship and equal rights. The two-state concept was thus transformed from a possible solution to Israeli occupation to the primary pretext for depriving Palestinians of equality. It was also the main excuse for keeping the majority of Palestinians in exile: in order to preserve Israel’s Jewish majority, the refugees would have to languish in camps outside Israel’s borders until there was a Palestinian state that could absorb them.The BDS movement offered an alternative. It rejected talk of fictive solutions, whether of two states or one. The most fundamental problem, in its view, was not in deciding what sort of arrangement should replace the current system the problem was forcing Israel to change it at all. Debating two states versus one amounted to counting angels on the point of a pin, so long as Israel was comfortable enough in perpetual occupation to prefer it to either one.Israel’s response to BDS was slow in coming, but forceful once it arrived. Yossi Kuperwasser, who goes by the nickname Kuper, led the Israeli government’s efforts against the BDS movement until 2014. He now works for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a conservative thinktank run by Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and a longtime confidante of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Kuperwasser, who has a grown-out buzz cut, a gruff voice and the Israeli habit of filling pauses with a grumbling “ehh”, is an engaging and emphatic interlocutor. He has good Arabic, as does his wife, Tsionit (“Zionist” in Hebrew), who was born in Israel to Iraqi Jewish parents. Kuper headed the prestigious research ision of military intelligence during the second intifada, and was appointed director general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs in 2009.It was Kuperwasser who turned the ministry into Israel’s command centre for what he calls the battle against BDS. He began the job just after the 2008-2009 Gaza war, which had killed 13 Israelis and around 1,400 Palestinians, lifting BDS activity to new heights. In September 2009, Israel’s international standing was dealt a heavy blow by the UN’s report on the war, written by a fact-finding mission headed by the eminent South African jurist Richard Goldstone. It found that Israel and Palestinian armed groups had committed war crimes, and that Israel had conducted “deliberate attacks on civilians” with “the intention of spreading terror”. It also determined that the ongoing blockade of Gaza – “the series of acts that deprive Palestinians … of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country” – constituted a possible crime against humanity.Kuperwasser said it was the Goldstone report that first alerted Israel to the grave nature of the threat posed by what it calls “delegitimisation”. In late 2009, Netanyahu identified delegitimisation as one of three critical threats to Israel, alongside Iran’s nuclear programme and the proliferation of rockets and missiles in Gaza and Lebanon. Since then, it has become common to hear senior Israeli politicians describe BDS and delegitimisation as an “existential” or “strategic” threat.Some of Israel’s centre-left commentators, all of whom oppose BDS, have nevertheless taken a rather cynical view of the government’s international campaign against BDS. They believe it is driven primarily by domestic politics. They point out that since the founding of BDS 13 years ago, Israel’s trade with the outside world has actually increased, and its diplomatic ties with India, China, African states and even the Arab world have grown. Many mainstream Israeli commentators see the BDS movement and Israeli politicians of the left and right working in symbiosis: the Israeli left threatens that BDS and delegitimisation will create an international “diplomatic tsunami” against Israel the Israeli right does its usual scaremongering about external threats in order to drum up support at home and abroad. The BDS movement, meanwhile, eagerly points to every hyperbolic Israeli statement as evidence of its own success.Kuperwasser, however, says the threat BDS poses is very real, and that ignoring it or treating it as a nuisance will fail: “Until 2010, we tried this policy, and the results were not good.” More important, he said, measuring the impact of BDS in terms of Israel’s trade was fundamentally mistaken. “The core issue is not whether they are going to boycott us or not boycott us,” Kuperwasser said. “The core issue is whether they are going to be successful in implanting in the international discourse that Israel is illegitimate as a Jewish state.”Tens of thousands of Palestinians reside in villages that predate the existence of Israel but are considered “unrecognised” by the state, facing demolitions and forcible evictions while receiving few to no basic services, including water and electricity. With the state limiting the development and expansion of Arab towns, Palestinian citizens have been forced to bid on properties in Jewish communities. But they have been repeatedly blocked. Hundreds of Jewish-only communities in Israel have admissions committees that are legally permitted to reject applicants on the basis of “social suitability”, providing cover for excluding non-Jews. “What we Palestinians in Israel face is apartheid, not discrimination,” Zoabi said. “Israel tries to say, ‘We are good Israel that has to do bad things in the West Bank and Gaza.’ No, look at how Israel treats its own citizens who don’t throw a stone!”Israel’s longstanding policies of inequality were given additional backing in the form of a July 2018 “basic law” – Israel’s version of constitutional laws – that downgrades the status of the Arabic language, states that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, and declares: “The state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.”Zoabi said the PLO had forsaken its responsibilities to the Palestinian people. After formally committing to two separate states in 1988, she said, “the PLO effectively conceded Israel as a Jewish state”, with inequality between Jews and non-Jews enshrined in its laws. It was now mainly the Palestinian citizens of Israel who really challenged Zionism itself, she said, by insisting that the state could not truly be both democratic and Jewish. As a result, Palestinian citizens of Israel had become a “much bigger threat to Israel than the PLO”. She continued: “The PLO defined our struggle” – the struggle of Palestinian citizens for equality – “as an internal Israeli issue. They abandoned us!”Zoabi harshly criticized the Palestinian leadership for its role in prolonging the occupation. She blamed Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO chairman and PA president also known as Abu Mazen, for the fact that the US president Donald Trump had decided to break with decades of US policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December. “Trump made a calculation,” she told me. “What will be the reaction to my move? All of Israel and the US said to him, correctly, that Abu Mazen will not change the rules of the game, will not end security cooperation with Israel, and will not stop Oslo. So what price will Israel or the US pay?” Zoabi said that when she travelled abroad, to countries such as Ireland, Germany and the US, “officials there told me: ‘The PLO ambassador is against your position on BDS. So who am I supposed to believe?’”Despite their totally opposing goals, the Israeli right and the leaders of the BDS movement agree on quite a lot. Both assert that at its heart the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is over Zionism and the forced exile of the majority of Palestinians in 1948, not Israel’s 1967 conquest of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank. Both contend that the settlements should not be treated differently from the government that created them. Both believe that the demands of Palestinian citizens of Israel for equality and of refugees for return are central issues of dispute, which were given insufficient attention by past peacemakers. Both say that Israel’s battle against BDS is not primarily an economic struggle. Both view the BDS movement as representative of mainstream Palestinian demands, despite acknowledging that the movement cannot mobilise large crowds and its main activists are not important figures in Palestinian politics. And both believe that the BDS movement will expose the true nature of the conflict to the world.But whereas the BDS movement is betting that this exposure will lead people to conclude that Zionism is fundamentally racist and should be rejected, Kuperwasser, for one, is convinced it is the Palestinians who will be unmasked. “The Palestinians are taking a very big risk,” he said. “Because, in my mind, there is a good chance that the world will deny their conceptual framework. People will say: ‘This is what the Palestinians want?! We are totally against it … They are crazy they want Israel to disappear.’” If that happens, he added, the Palestinians won’t even get a West Bank-Gaza state, which he believes the PLO still sees as merely the first stage toward liberating all of Palestine.In Kuperwasser’s view, the BDS movement and the Palestinian leadership share the same goals the differences between them are merely a matter of tactics. “Abu Mazen understands more than the BDS movement that you have to be subtle,” he said. The PLO’s acceptance of a two-state solution, its vows to take into account Israel’s demographic concerns, its silence on the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel – all of these, Kuperwasser added, were merely a subterfuge designed to obtain a West Bank-Gaza state, which would then serve as a launching pad for continued struggle. “The Palestinian idea of struggle is so deeply embedded in their mind that they cannot actually think about the possibility of giving up the struggle in order to make peace. I cannot tell you how many Palestinians I told, ‘Listen, with this struggle, you are paying the price much more than we do. We are flourishing. Even if we pay a price, we are flourishing.’”The key for Israel, he said, was winning the hearts and minds of centrist liberals and progressives abroad, not people who are already in the Zionist or anti-Zionist camps. What had made it more difficult, he said, was that some Israelis and Jews were guilty of “negligence and intentional giving up of the battlefield” – not the radical left, but centrists who had naively adopted the language of the enemy. Kuperwasser singled out the former Labor party prime minister Ehud Barak, who had repeatedly warned that Israel is “on a slippery slope toward apartheid” – a warning that has also been made by the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and the former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Yitzhak Rabin. For Kuperwasser, these statements, intended to convince Israelis to make territorial concessions for peace, were above all a gift to its enemies.For the BDS movement, the charge of apartheid, which became prominent after the start of the second intifada in 2000, was not merely a provocative analogy to South Africa but a legal claim, based on the crime of apartheid as defined in international conventions and the founding statute of the international criminal court: “an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”.The concept of apartheid became central to the BDS movement’s framing of the conflict. Whereas the Palestinian Authority sought to accentuate its autonomy and state-like characteristics, the BDS movement underlined the PA’s subservience to Israel. For proponents of the two-state model, the PA was a nationalist project working toward eventual independence, while in the apartheid framework it was merely an Israeli satrap. BDS leaders emphasised the de facto “one-state reality” of Israel-Palestine – which had become a common trope even among Israel’s supporters, many of whom were dismayed at the possibility that the country could eventually be forced to enfranchise the Palestinians living under occupation and thereby cease to be a Jewish state.Increasingly among both Israel’s centre-left friends and its enemies, the idea of a single state was not a plan for the future – to be sought or averted – but an accurate description of the reality on the ground, which was becoming more and more difficult to disentangle. Jews were already a minority in the territory under the control of Israel, which regulated the Palestinians’ borders, exports and imports, customs revenues and permits for travel and work. Legally, commercially and administratively, the Jewish and Palestinian populations were interlaced.The more deeply entrenched this one-state reality became, the more resonant the charge of apartheid, and the more difficult to imagine undoing it through partition into two states. A battle against occupation could be concluded with a simple military withdrawal, but a struggle against apartheid could be won only with the end of state policies that discriminated against non-Jews. In the case of Israel, these could be found not just in the occupied territories, but everywhere Palestinians came into contact with the state. In the West Bank, Palestinians were denied the right to vote for the government controlling their lives, deprived of free assembly and movement, forbidden from equal access to roads, resources and territory, and imprisoned indefinitely without charge. In Gaza, they could not exit, enter, import, export or even approach their borders without the permission of Israel or its ally, Egypt. In Jerusalem, they were segregated from one another and encircled by checkpoints and walls. In Israel, they were evicted from their lands, prevented from reclaiming their expropriated homes, and blocked from residing in communities inhabited exclusively by Jews. In the diaspora, they were prevented from reunifying with their families in Israel-Palestine or returning to their homes, solely because they were not Jews.Though in public, world leaders spoke endlessly of a two-state solution, privately many doubted it was still possible. They regularly condemned settlements (since these, unlike occupation, were illegal), but they did nothing to reverse settlement growth. They called for Palestinians to have freedom, but not through equal rights and citizenship in one state – because, among other reasons, international law forbids Israel from annexing territory acquired by force. They saw Israel was subverting a two-state solution and taking measures to deprive Palestinians of rights. But they wouldn’t exert any real pressure on Israel so long as it mouthed an intention to one day grant Palestinians some limited form of independence. Israel was thereby allowed to hold all the land while excluding the majority of its indigenous people, just as South Africa had aspired to do. In redefining the conflict as a case of apartheid, BDS activists saw a way out of this trap. The apartheid rubric could also undo the Palestinians’ greatest weakness – fragmentation – by uniting them in a common struggle against a single, discriminatory regime.In Gaza this January, I met Haidar Eid, a professor of literature at Al-Azhar University and a co-founder of the BDS movement in Gaza. He is in his mid-50s, compact, with a scruffy grey beard and short curly hair, and a fondness for knitted turtlenecks. Eid said that he had never seen such strain on the people of Gaza. It was weeks before Gazans would launch the Great March of Return, the weekly protests along the Gaza border fence in which Israeli snipers killed more than 100 unarmed demonstrators and wounded several thousand more.Like more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population, Eid and his family are refugees from a village in present-day Israel. He opposed the Oslo agreement because it ignored Palestinian refugees. “Oslo,” he said, “reduced the Palestinian people to residents of the West Bank and Gaza.” But it was refugees who founded the Palestinian national movement, and who accounted for the majority of Palestinians worldwide. He said, “The Palestinian issue is one thing: the right of return.”Eid’s village, Zarnuqa, was purged of its Palestinian inhabitants and no longer stands. Throughout Israel the land of refugees remains largely empty or sparsely populated, such that prominent researchers, such as the Palestinian historian Salman Abu Sitta, estimate that most could return without displacing Israelis. Eid noted that a two-state solution meant precluding most refugees from returning, since Israel refuses any possible threat to its Jewish demographic majority. (There is a myth propagated by some of Israel’s supporters that Palestinians are the only people who pass on refugee status to their children. On this basis, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have sought to cut UN assistance to millions of Palestinian refugees born after the 1948 war. In fact, granting refugee status to stateless descendants is standard practice throughout the world. The majority of registered Afghan refugees, for example, are second- and third-generation, born outside the country, as are most who have returned to Afghanistan in recent years.)Eid spent six years in Johannesburg, where he obtained his doctorate, and his English has traces of a South African accent. He compared Gaza and the Palestinian refugee camps outside Israel’s borders to the Bantustans in which black South Africans were confined under apartheid it was his view that a two-state solution would not end apartheid but rather consolidate it, creating an enfeebled, discontiguous West Bank-Gaza state that would have a dubious claim to independence.To Eid, the two-state solution was an essentially racist proposal, because it was designed to preserve a Jewish ethnic majority, with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews. He preferred a single, democratic, non-racial, non-religious state, which he said was a “huge compromise for Palestinians”, because it would give “citizenship and forgiveness to settlers and occupiers”. Eid objected to the PLO’s insincere threats to seek such an outcome, which he wrote off as a misguided attempt to scare the Israelis into accepting ethnic partition: “I mean, equality is not scary! If you are against equality and justice, you are against human rights.”Relying on states to behave morally was a lost cause, he argued they needed to be pressured by their own people from below, through BDS activism by civil society. He recalled that it had taken more than 30 years for the international community to heed the calls for boycott, estment and sanctions against apartheid South Africa, whose violent overreaction to indigenous resistance had been a prime driver of international solidarity. Just as the boycotts against South Africa had been stoked by the apartheid regime’s killings of protesters, Eid said, “the growth of BDS has been paved in Gaza’s blood. Every massacre we have in Gaza convinces me more that the only hope we have is popular resistance and BDS.”Though BDS has not had a major economic impact on Israel so far, compared to the decades-long campaign in South Africa, its ascent has been rather steep. Institutional investors such as the Dutch pension fund PGGM and the United Methodist Church have withdrawn from Israeli banks. The Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Christ, and Norway’s largest private pension fund have ested from companies profiting from Israel’s occupation. And major firms such as Veolia, Orange, G4S and CRH have fully or mostly pulled out of Israel following boycott campaigns. Dozens of student governments and numerous academic associations have endorsed boycott and estment initiatives. And many musicians and artists have cancelled shows or pledged to boycott the country.No less important, the BDS movement has effectively won the argument inside Palestine: whereas Abu Mazen had stated, in 2013, that while the PLO supports settlement boycotts, “we do not support the boycott of Israel” because “we have relations with Israel, we have mutual recognition of Israel”, by 2018 the PLO had at least rhetorically adopted BDS. International organisations, too, have been influenced by the BDS movement to move slowly from ineffectual condemnations to calls for practical measures that have some teeth. Last summer, Amnesty International called for a worldwide ban on settlement products and an arms embargo on Israel and Palestinian armed groups. Human Rights Watch called on institutional investors in Israeli banks to ensure that they are not contributing to or benefiting from settlements and other violations of international law. And the UN human rights office has compiled a list of over 200 companies – the majority based in Israel or the occupied territories, 22 based in the US – that are linked to the establishment, expansion or maintenance of Israeli settlements. In what is expected to be the most significant development in the 13-year-old BDS campaign, the UN human rights office plans to publish the names of these companies later this year.Nearly all of the corporate and student-led estments have been selective: they have not targeted Israel as a whole, but only settlements and occupation. A number of them had little to do with the BDS movement itself. But both the Israeli government and the BDS movement have tended to obscure this fact. Doing so has helped the BDS movement appear to rack up victories, and it has helped the Israeli government to discredit cautious bureaucratic initiatives to adhere to international law, casting them instead as unhinged, demonising efforts by BDS radicals.Conflating boycotts of the settlements with opposition to Israel’s existence has been a central element of the government’s policy, reflecting a desire not just to protect settlements but to stem the tide of selective boycotts that could spread to Israel as a whole. “We are saying there is no difference between a settlement boycott and a boycott of Israel,” Yossi Kuperwasser said. “If you want to promote the boycotting of Israel, any part of Israel, you are not a friend of Israel. You are actually an enemy of Israel. So we have to deal with you.”The government has passed a law that bars entry to foreigners who have publicly supported a boycott of Israel “or an area under its control”. Its minister of strategic affairs has called for imposing financial penalties on Israeli organisations, companies and in some cases iniduals who advocate boycotts of either Israel or the settlements. After Hagai El-Ad, the head of the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, addressed the UN security council and called on it to take action against Israel’s occupation, the chairman of the governing coalition called to revoke his citizenship and to create a bill that would do the same to any Israeli who calls on international bodies to take action against Israel.This deliberate elision of Israel and the settlements has caused no small amount of consternation among the state’s more liberal supporters in the American Jewish community. For years they have sought to protect Israel itself from sanction, by arguing that only boycotts of settlements are legitimate. Now they feel themselves under attack not just from BDS, on the left, but the Israeli government, on the right, both of which disdain the centre-left notion of being “pro-Israel and anti-occupation”, and both of which reject the position that wine produced in West Bank settlements should be boycotted while the government that created, financed and maintained the settlements should not.Israel’s strategy has been to force a choice on companies subjected to pressure to withdraw or est: stay in Israeli-controlled territory and ignore the boycott campaign, or accede to its demands and face potential lawsuits and losses in much bigger markets in Europe and the US. Given that choice, Kuperwasser said, most companies would be very reluctant to withdraw from Israel or the settlements: “But if it’s going to happen, there are going to be more laws around the world that are going to make these companies suffer. We can retaliate and come up with a response.”The Ministry of Strategic Affairs has outsourced much of its anti-BDS activity in foreign countries, helping to establish and finance front groups and partner organisations, in an attempt to minimise the appearance of Israeli interference in the domestic politics of its allies in Europe and the US. Kuper said that anti-BDS groups were now “sprouting like mushrooms after the rain”. He and a number of other former intelligence and security officials are members of one of them, Kella Shlomo, described as a “PR commando unit” that will work with and receive tens of millions of dollars from the Ministry of Strategic Affairs. In 2016, Israel’s embassy in London sent a cable to Jerusalem complaining that the strategic affairs ministry was endangering British Jewish organisations, most of which are registered as charities and forbidden from political activity: “‘operating’ Jewish organisations directly from Jerusalem … is liable to be dangerous” and “could encounter opposition from the organisations themselves, given their legal status Britain isn’t the US!” Last year, al-Jazeera aired undercover recordings of an Israeli official working out of the London embassy, who described being asked by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs to help establish a “private company” in the UK that would work for the Israeli government and in liaison with pro-Israel groups like Aipac.To Israeli liberals, the gravest threat from BDS is that it has induced in their government a reaction so reckless and overreaching that it resembles a sort of auto-immune disease, in which the battle against BDS also damages the rights of ordinary citizens and the organs of democracy. Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs has utilised the intelligence services to surveil and attack delegitimisers of Israel. It called to establish a blacklist of Israeli organisations and citizens who support the nonviolent boycott campaign, created a “tarnishing unit” to besmirch the reputations of boycott supporters, and placed paid articles in the Israeli press. Leftwing Israeli Jews have been summoned for interrogation or stopped at the border by agents of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, who described themselves as officers working against delegitimisation. Israel has banned 20 organisations from entry for their political opinions, including the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that won a Nobel peace prize for helping Holocaust refugees and that now supports self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians while also endorsing BDS.Last year, the Israeli intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, called publicly for “targeted civil assassinations” of activists such as the BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti, a permanent resident of Israel. Barghouti was also threatened by Israel’s minister of public security and strategic affairs: “Soon any activist who uses their influence to delegitimise the only Jewish state in the world will know they will pay a price for it … We will soon be hearing more of our friend Barghouti.” Not long after, Barghouti was prevented from exiting the country, and last year Israeli authorities searched his home and arrested him for tax evasion.Perhaps Israel’s most powerful tool in the campaign against delegitimisation has been to accuse the country’s critics of antisemitism. Doing so required changing official definitions of the term. This effort began during the final years of the second intifada, in 2003 and 2004, as pre-BDS calls to boycott and est from Israel were gaining steam. At that time, a group of institutes and experts, including Dina Porat – a Tel Aviv University scholar who had a been a member of the Israeli foreign ministry’s delegation to the 2001 UN world conference against racism in Durban, South Africa – proposed creating a new definition of antisemitism that would equate criticisms of Israel with hatred of Jews.These experts and institutions, working with the American Jewish Committee and other Israel advocacy groups, formulated a new “working definition” of antisemitism, including a list of examples, that was published in 2005 (and later discarded) by an EU body for combating racism. This working definition was adapted in 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), and has been used, endorsed or recommended, with some small modifications, by a number of other organisations – including the US Department of State, which, since 2008, has defined antisemitism to include any of three categories of criticism of Israel, known as the “three Ds”: delegitimisation of Israel, demonisation of Israel and double standards for Israel. (More recently, the IHRA working definition has been at the centre of the antisemitism controversy in the Labour party, which adopted a modified version of the examples accompanying the definition.)By the state department’s definition, delegitimisation includes “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist”. Thus anti-Zionism – including the view that Israel should be a state of all its citizens, with equal rights for Jews and non-Jews – is a form of delegitimisation and therefore antisemitic. According to this definition, virtually all Palestinians (and a large proportion of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel, who oppose Zionism for religious reasons) are guilty of antisemitism because they want Jews and Palestinians to continue living in Palestine but not within a Jewish state. Kuperwasser, for one, stands by the charge: “Anti-Zionism and antisemitism are the same lady in a different cloak.”The second D, demonisation, includes “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” – as the Israeli army’s deputy chief of staff did during a Holocaust remembrance day speech in 2016, likening the “revolting trends” in Europe and Germany in the 1930s and 40s to tendencies visible in Israel today. The last of the three Ds, applying double standards, holds that singling Israel out for criticism is “the new antisemitism”. Yet practically every earlier estment and boycott initiative around the world could be accused of double standards, including the campaign against apartheid South Africa, most of whose proponents ignored graver transgressions elsewhere, such as the concurrent genocides in Cambodia, Iraqi Kurdistan and East Timor.The new definition of antisemitism has been frequently deployed against Israel’s critics in the US, especially on university campuses. Israel advocacy groups have urged several universities to adopt the state department definition. At Northeastern University in Boston and the University of Toledo in Ohio, pro-Israel students and advocacy groups attempted to thwart even discussing boycott and estment, arguing that it would create an antisemitic climate on campus. The California legislature passed a resolution in 2012 to regulate speech on California campuses it cited examples of antisemitism that included not just delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel but also “student- and faculty-sponsored boycott, estment and sanctions campaigns against Israel”.In 2015, an anonymous website, Canary Mission, began publishing lists of pro-Palestinian students who support estment, often accusing them of antisemitism the Israeli government has used Canary Mission profiles to interrogate and deny entry to pro-BDS US citizens. On several campuses, pro-Israel groups have intimidated pro-Palestinian students and faculty by placing names from the Canary Mission website on posters that state: “The following students and faculty … have allied themselves with Palestinian terrorists to perpetrate BDS and Jew Hatred on this campus.”Kuperwasser was unapologetic about the perceived excesses of Israel’s anti-BDS campaign at home and abroad. He was confident that Israel was taking the right approach and would succeed, as it had against past assaults: “We won the war on the conventional battlefield. To start with, our chances were very slim. We won the war on terror. Again, it wasn’t easy. I remember when we went to the big battle – the second intifada – and many generals around the world were telling me, ‘Listen, Kuper, you’re wasting your time: nobody ever won a war against terrorism,’ citing Vietnam and other cases. And I said: ‘No, we shall win this war as well. We are innovative and determined enough. And unlike many other battles, we don’t have a second option, an alternative. We have to win.’ The same goes here. We shall win.”Because the BDS movement opposes a state with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews and therefore rejects the idea of a Jewish state, many diaspora Jews view the threat it poses as existential. Thanks in no small part to the BDS movement, the Israel-Palestine debate is transforming from a question of how to end Israel’s occupation, which most liberal Jews do not support, to a referendum on the legitimacy of Israel, which they consider a settled fact that they shouldn’t have to defend.Beneath this principled opposition, there are also more visceral misgivings. One of the primary apprehensions of liberal Zionists about the BDS movement is what they consider to be its strident tone and uncompromising positions. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the head of T’ruah, a rabbinic human rights organisation that works in both Israel and the US, said that she “straddles the line between progressive groups where Zionist is a bad word and pro-Israel groups where occupation is a bad word”. She said she felt alienated by the hostility of the BDS movement, which at times seemed to her downright gleeful as it publicised Israel’s misdeeds. “BDS is triggering 2,000 years of Jewish trauma and 70 years of post-Holocaust trauma,” she said. David Shulman, a renowned Indologist, Hebrew University professor, and activist with Ta’ayush (“co-existence”), a leftwing Israeli-Palestinian group that protects Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks, said that his biggest problem with BDS was “the virulent tonality” of it: “I understand it is a heterogeneous movement. But so much of it is based on hatred, which is a terrible basis for political action.”Many liberal Zionists recoil not just at the vehemence of some BDS activists, but also at their occasional conflation of Israel and the Jewish people, which they feel smacks of antisemitism. Simone Zimmerman, a co-founder of the American Jewish anti-occupation group IfNotNow, said she found the Israeli government no less guilty of the charge: “Bibi Netanyahu goes around the world saying, ‘I am here to represent the Jewish people, and the IDF is doing what it’s doing on behalf of all the Jewish people in the world.’ And the American Jewish Committee and Aipac say we’re doing what we’re doing to keep the Jews safe. I find it hard to make the case that our critics should be more nuanced than we are ourselves.”In the US and Europe, liberal Jews feel as alienated by the anti-Zionist BDS movement as by the illiberal supporters of Israeli policies they deplore. Last fall, the rightwing Zionist Organization of America feted Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser whose ex-wife, in a sworn court declaration, recalled his complaint that their daughters’ school had too many Jews. Bannon had proclaimed himself a “Christian Zionist”. The “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer, an organiser of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which white supremacists had chanted “Jews will not replace us”, had also declared himself a sort of Zionist, inspired by Israel’s example as an exclusionary ethnic state. Last year he said to an Israeli television interviewer: “You could say I’m a white Zionist in the sense that I care about my people. I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves, just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.”The alliance between Israel’s allies and ultra-nationalists in Europe and the US has become a central theme of the BDS campaign’s messages. In this respect, the Trump era has been good for the movement. So has the Netanyahu government, whose attacks on BDS have been among the greatest drivers of publicity and recruitment for the campaign.Jacobs said that it had become harder and harder to be pro-Israel and anti-occupation in progressive spaces. “On the left, support for BDS is a litmus test: either you support it or you have no place.” To progressives, centre-left pro-Israel groups are increasingly viewed as Aipac-lite, supporting two states in name while in practice protecting Israel from any sort of pressure that might induce it to end a very comfortable occupation.Sharon Brous, a leading progressive rabbi in the US, told me, “I am not supportive of BDS, but I think we haven’t treated it correctly. Boycott is a tool that we in the Jewish community use often. It is nonviolent.” American progressives have advocated a number of domestic boycotts in recent years – including one against the state of North Carolina, over a controversial anti-LGBT law. Mouin Rabbani, a senior fellow with the Institute for Palestine Studies who is not active in the BDS movement, told me, “All these years we heard Israel and its supporters ask, ‘Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?’ And then when faced with a totally nonviolent Palestinian boycott campaign, they say they can’t support it.”Simone Zimmerman, the IfNotNow co-founder, said: “If you ask a random American Jew on the street, ‘Do you believe that people in their society shouldn’t discriminate based on ethnic heritage, and all people should have access to all the basic rights that you care about in America?’, they’d probably say yes. And then it comes to Israel, and they say: ‘Equality for all people? You’re trying to wipe Israel off the face of the map!’”In Jaffa one Saturday afternoon, I met Kobi Snitz, a mathematician who works at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and is a member of Boycott from Within, a group of pro-BDS Israelis, most of whom are Jews. Snitz is a veteran activist who has been participating in West Bank demonstrations with Palestinians since the second intifada. He has been arrested numerous times and spent many years protesting alongside the family of Ahed Tamimi, who has become a symbol of Palestinian unarmed resistance, following her arrest last December, at age 16, for slapping Israeli soldiers who entered her property shortly after the army shot her 15-year-old cousin in the head at close range. Kobi said that the protests he had joined in Tamimi’s village, Nabi Saleh, had dwindled over the years, as had non-violent resistance in the West Bank more generally. “It’s amazing that it lasted as long as it did,” he said. “Four died in Nabi Saleh, hundreds were injured, and roughly a third of the village was detained or jailed. For a village of 500 people to put up that kind of resistance on its own for that long is extraordinary. But, yes, eventually it dies down and dwindles. Oppression works. Terror works.”Snitz drove me, in a beat-up old sedan, to a lunch of Sudanese lentils in Neve Sha’anan, the poor south Tel Aviv neighbourhood that is home to many African asylum seekers. We were the only non-Africans in the restaurant or on the street. At bottom, he explained, boycott was a peaceful tactic of resisting immoral repression the refusal to cooperate with gross injustice, he argued, was the minimum required of a person of conscience. As we drove back to Jaffa, passing a prison in which Snitz had been detained, he paraphrased words he had heard from the BDS co-founder, Omar Barghouti. “Omar said: ‘Look, I don’t want the west to come and save us. I’m not asking for the west to come invade Israel. I’m just asking it to stop supporting our oppression.’” Snitz added: “It’s true that this conflict is not special in how bad the violations are. What is special is how much the liberal west actively supports them.”• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76356e5e95313a306714bf370e7cc145221210eb/0_0_5324_3443/master/5324.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc219fc02b6608319d782bbe45f6d3b4 660w","title":"jeremy corbyn not involved munich olympics massacre wreath laying","story":"Labour leader rows with Israeli PM over ceremony for iniduals from group behind Munich massacreJeremy Corbyn has said he was present but not involved at a wreath-laying for iniduals behind the group that carried out the Munich Olympic massacre, a partial admission that has led to a row with Israel’s prime minister.The Labour leader had been asked if Palestinian leaders linked to the Black September terror group were also honoured at a memorial event he attended in Tunisia in 2014, at which victims of the 1985 Israeli airstrike in Tunis were remembered.Corbyn said “a wreath was indeed laid” for “some of those who were killed in Paris in 1992” and added in response to a question: “I was present at that wreath-laying, I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”Jeremy Corbyn has said that he was present but not involved at a wreath-laying for people behind the group that carried out the Munich Olympics massacre.The row centres on a wreath-laying event in Tunisia for two separate groups, both the victims of a 1985 Israeli airstrike in Tunis and for the Palestinian leaders linked to the Black September terror group who killed Israeli athletes.There are memorials to the victims of the 1985 bombing and a four graves for leading figures from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, thought to have been behind the Black September group, in different parts of the cemetery.Corbyn was attending a conference in Tunisia called the International Conference on Monitoring the Palestinian Political and Legal Situation in the Light of Israeli Aggression.In an article for the Morning Star in 2014, shortly after his visit, Corbyn said he was present for a ceremony honouring the 1985 victims and “others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991”.The Palestine Liberation Organisation’s intelligence chief Atef Bseiso – who has been accused of involvement in the Munich Olympics massacre – was killed in Paris in 1992, purportedly by Mossad. No-one was killed in Paris in 1991, so Corbyn may just have got the wrong date.On Saturday, the Daily Mail published pictures of Corbyn holding a wreath at the Palestinian Martyrs’ Cemetery in Tunisia.The paper said that its own visit to the cemetery had shown that the memorial for the victims of the 1985 bombing was 15 yards away from the spot where Corbyn was pictured holding a wreath.The story claims the pictures were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of the Black September and yards from the grave of Bseiso.Corbyn said that “a wreath was indeed laid” for “some of those who were killed in Paris in 1992” and added, in response to a question: “I was present at that wreath-laying, I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”He added: “I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere.Labour has said that Corbyn had already made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks indicate he was at least aware of another wreath-laying at the memorial event.Corbyn was speaking two days after the Daily Mail unearthed pictures of the Labour MP holding a wreath at the event, near the graves of four Palestinian leaders believed to be connected to Black September, which carried out the terror attack on Israelis at the 1972 Olympics, in which 11 people died.Labour previously said Corbyn had made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli airstrike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks, the first time he has spoken since the Mail story on Saturday, indicate that another wreath-laying took place at the memorial event.A few hours after Corbyn spoke, Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement via his official Twitter account criticising the Labour leader. “The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between,” the Israeli prime minister wrote.Labour said Netanyahu’s criticism was “false” and Corbyn responded by attacking the Israeli prime minister for presiding over the deaths of scores of people in Gaza. A party spokesman said: “Jeremy did not lay any wreath at the graves of those alleged to have been linked to the Black September organisation or the 1972 Munich killings. He of course condemns that terrible attack, as he does the 1985 bombing.”Shortly after, Corbyn, via his own Twitter feed, stepped up his response to Netanyahu. “What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children,” the Labour leader wrote.The wreath-laying took place at an event at the Palestinian martyrs’ cemetery in Tunisia during a visit by Corbyn in 2014, a year before he became the party’s leader. There is a memorial to the victims of the 1985 bombing at the cemetery, although it is described as being 15 yards away from where Corbyn was pictured.A couple of metres behind where Corbyn and the group of people are standing are four graves of senior members of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, thought to have been behind the Black September group. One of those belongs to Atef Bseiso, the PLO’s head of intelligence, who was assassinated outside a Paris hotel in 1992, and was allegedly killed by the Israeli secret service in revenge for the 1972 attack.Another is the grave of Salah Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, who was the second in command in the PLO at the time of his death and is the most senior Palestinian figure buried in the Tunisian cemetery. Khalaf, who is believed to have been a key figure behind Black September, was killed in Tunis in 1991, alongside two other figures who are also buried in the graveyard.The Labour MP Luciana Berger said Corbyn needed to apologise. “Being ‘present’ is the same as being involved. When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. There can also never be a ‘fitting memorial’ for terrorists. Where is the apology?” she said.Over the weekend, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, called on Corbyn to resign over the issue as the Conservatives sought to capitalise on the row.The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said Corbyn should apologise and accused the Labour leader of being “evasive”.Marie van der Zyl told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “After days of being evasive, Jeremy Corbyn has now admitted attending a memorial event for the terrorist murders of unarmed athletes. How can you say he is not involved?“In 1972, these are unarmed people who were attending the Olympics, they were savagely mutilated and murdered. There is no reason Jeremy Corbyn should not apologise to the widows and to the victims for this terrible massacre … He needs to also recognise that he can’t cavort with terrorists.” It is not the first time the event in Tunisia has been the subject of controversy. In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Michael Fallon, then the defence secretary, said his presence there showed that Corbyn was “unfit” to be prime minister.Fallon’s accusation was based on an account given by Corbyn about the trip in the Morning Star newspaper in October 2014. He wrote: “Wreaths were laid to mark the 1985 bombing of the PLO HQ and on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991.” He appears to have made a mistake about the dates because the only person killed in Paris was Bseiso in 1992.The controversy emerges at a time when Labour is embroiled in a row about antisemitism and whether the party will adopt in full, with all its examples, the definition produced by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).Corbyn said in the same interview that the Labour party would consult with the Jewish and Palestinian communities over whether to adopt one remaining example attached to the IHRA definition.Striking a conciliatory tone, he said Labour had agreed to the IHRA definition and almost all of its 11 examples. “The one example that we are discussing and consulting on is one that makes sure that you can discuss and debate the relations between Israel and Palestine, the future of the peace process and, yes, make criticisms of the actions of the Israeli government in the bombing of Gaza and other places,” Corbyn said. “But you can never make those criticisms with antisemitic language or antisemitic intentions. And that is what we are absolutely clear on.”His remarks confirmed that Labour had dropped its objections to three other examples attached to the IHRA code. The remaining sticking point is the example that states “claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour” is antisemitic – because of concerns in the party about hindering legitimate criticism of the creation of Israel.The Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the only way “Jeremy Corbyn can put this issue to bed” is to “adopt the internationally agreed definition of antisemitism in full”. She said: “Until he does that, incidents such as his presence at the laying of wreaths at the graves of those responsible for torturing and murdering innocent Jewish Israeli athletes in Munich will continue to emerge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51e5a6851f7006399dd58b7aa4ab8030a8f24415/0_202_3279_1967/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461cb775672e33fc26e60964b78643b9","title":"ben stokes rejoins england squad cleared affray third test","story":"England have added Ben Stokes to their squad for Saturday’s third Test after his acquittal at Bristol crown court.Stokes, cleared of a charge of affray on Tuesday lunchtime, was not in the 13-man squad England announced the previous day to face India at Trent Bridge.But within two hours of the end of his court case, the England and Wales Cricket Board issued a brief statement which read: “Ben Stokes will now join the England squad for the third Test against India, which starts at Trent Bridge on Saturday.”An independent Cricket Discipline Commission disciplinary investigation into the behaviour of Stokes and teammate Alex Hales – which acts under the auspices of the ECB – was put on hold last September, while court proceedings took precedence.But in its statement, the ECB confirmed the CDC will soon resume its deliberations.It added: “Now the legal proceedings have concluded, the disciplinary process for Ben Stokes and Alex Hales can be scheduled by the Cricket Discipline Commission.“Considerable detail has been heard in this week-long court case and, in due course, there will be a range of matters for the board to fully consider.”Stokes was cleared, alongside co-defendant Ryan Ali, following the late-night events 11 months ago - when a fight broke out in the street outside a Bristol nightclub.England subsequently ruled their premier all-rounder out of the remainder of the one-day international series against West Indies and then last winter’s Ashes before his return during the tour of New Zealand.The 27-year-old stayed in the team this summer, apart from a spell out with a hamstring injury, until he had to miss last week’s Lord’s Test victory over India because of a clash with his court case.He is now on course to return to help Joe Root’s hosts as they bid to extend a 2-0 series lead, with three more matches to play.Stokes’ solicitor Paul Lunt, in a statement read out after the England all-rounder was cleared, said: “Now that the trial is over, Ben is keen to get back to cricket being his sole focus.”The former England captain Michael Vaughan was among the first to react to Stokes’ acquittal. Before the ECB statement was published, writing on Twitter, Vaughan urged England to clear him to play again as soon as possible.He wrote: “I think the fact he missed the whole of the winter in Australia is punishment enough for Ben Stokes. I personally think now he has been proven to be not guilty he should be allowed to play .”Jonny Bairstow also voiced his hope, in advance of the ECB’s announcement, that he and Stokes would be playing together again soon.He told Sky Sports News: “It has been a long 10 months for him and his family. I’m delighted and hope we can see him back in an England shirt very soon.”Stokes’ county Durham issued a one-line statement confirming he will not be available for their Vitality Blast fixture on Friday – at a time when he will instead be preparing with England in Nottingham on the eve of the Test match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3efa55b1059e761d69bb592ee1b9a2e32e563e4d/0_231_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fb1049105062265b4450e0d47867f78","title":"the spin india practice makes perfect england cricket","story":"In January, after India had lost the first two of three Tests in South Africa, their coach, Ravi Shastri, reflected on the reasons for their failure. “Conditions back home, we are familiar with. Here, conditions are different,” he said. “In hindsight, I would say another 10 days of practice here would have made a difference.” Seven months later they are two down in a Test series in England.Given the clarity of his hindsight in January, Shastri’s subsequent lack of foresight seems startling: no touring team in history have done less red-ball practice before a five-Test series in England than this India side, who arranged a single four-day match against Essex, reduced at the last minute to three days because it was a bit hot, and decided that would do.“There will be more than enough time to get used to the conditions,” the former bowler Zaheer Khan said in April. “The kind of squad we have, most of them have played in England and are aware of what kind of conditions will be on offer.” It has not really worked out that way.“Practice makes a man perfect,” Kapil Dev said in March, as he looked ahead to this series and Virat Kohli’s chances of shining in it. “One has to practise for these conditions. The bar which we as cricketers set for these people is that you have to be good in all conditions. Virat Kohli, the question mark in front of him, it’s there. He has to get runs where it is considered to be the toughest conditions in the world. If he can play a season or two in English county cricket there would be nothing wrong, because if you want to be the best player in the world you have to get runs everywhere.”As captain of the India team who won a Test series in England in 1986 – and the World Cup three years earlier – Kapil knows what he is talking about. England had won the Ashes at home the previous summer – and their previous four Test series at home, including against India in 1982 – but went into the series having just been thumped 5-0 in the West Indies, with David Gower’s captaincy hanging by a thread, and following the publication in the Mail on Sunday a few days before the first Test of Ian Botham’s confession to recreational drug use, for which he received a two-month ban.But for all that India’s situation seemed even less promising. They had, after all, won one of 40 Tests since Kapil, bowling despite injury, took five for 28 to skittle Australia for 60 runs short of their meagre target of 143 and steal a ludicrously unlikely victory in Melbourne in February 1981. Before arriving in England Kapil had captained his side in 20 Tests, without winning any. Their 33 previous Tests in England had brought a solitary victory. And Kapil’s side had drawn all five of their three-day warm-up matches before the first Test.Though the two ODIs were played before the Tests in 1986, as was the limited-overs series this year, the squad nevertheless filled their time with meaningful long-form practice. In addition Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Maninder Singh and Kapil himself all had experience with English counties. Though born and raised in India Roger Binny, who produced prodigious swing on his way to figures of five for 40 at Headingley and six for 56 at Edgbaston, was the first Anglo-Indian to play Test cricket for the country. By the time the first Test began India had scored 1,027 runs and taken 36 wickets in their five three-day matches, many of them rain-affected, and they squeezed additional games between each Test.Even that would have been considered insufficient preparation for some. In 1959 the India touring party arrived in England on 17 April and left on 17 September. In between they scheduled 36 games, playing some counties on multiple occasions, and when they left – having been whitewashed in the five Tests but otherwise acquitted themselves well – their manager, the Maharaja of Baroda, said it had been “an extremely happy tour” that could only have improved if his players had even more knowledge of local conditions. “We had two main failings: our fielding, especially in the air, and our dislike of bowling above medium pace,” he said. “We must encourage our youngsters to become interested in being fast bowlers. I am recommending to the Indian board that we send our youngsters on minor tours of England to gain experience under varying conditions.”Conditions at Lord’s during this year’s second Test could scarcely have been more typically English. Given the weather at the time Kohli would have been little more accustomed to the frustration of constant rain breaks had he, as intended, spent June at Surrey, a plan ruined by injury.His has hardly been a terrible tour, with a half-century and first-innings 149 at Edgbaston a fortnight ago, but at 26.71 his average in England remains massively inferior to the 57.66 he manages elsewhere. This may dent his pride and stain his statistics but many would consider him the best batsman in the world anyway.Some will say there is scarcely enough space in the schedule to squeeze in more preparation but it’s there if you want it. By the time the third Test gets under way at Trent Bridge on Saturday India will have had 37 days without any scheduled cricket since arriving in England on 23 June in the entire five months they spent in the country in 1959, that India team had 38. Practice is an investment of time and effort in the hope of a return down the line. India have had the time and they wanted the return but it seems they lacked the inclination.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Top comedians relive their first fringe gigDave GormanI was 19 and nowhere near ready. I had a decent enough act – if there was a full house and everyone was up for it. But I had none of the skills needed for working a small, arms-folded, go-on-prove-it audience. Luckily, the only reviewer who came along didn’t hear my name and reviewed me under the title of the double act I’d replaced at the last minute. “Brute Farce,” wrote the critic, “is a strange young man who mumbles as he walks about the stage.” They’re probably still peeved.Dave Gorman’s With Great Powerpoint Comes Great Responsibilitypoint tour starts in September.My show was called The Cheese Roll and it climaxed with me re-enacting Gloucester’s famous cheese-rolling competition using a papier-mache model of Cooper’s Hill with two tiny figures and a mini Babybel. It was 2006 and I was on at 12pm in the back room of the Holyrood Tavern. No one came.One day, though, I managed to get a small crowd together because my supportive sister Eileen had come all the way from Gloucester and I didn’t want her to be the only person in the audience. When we got there, the doors were locked. My audience began to arrive and we all waited on the pavement together for ages – in the rain. It turned out the bar manager had gone clubbing the night before and overslept. So everyone left without seeing the show and Eileen got her train home.Bridget Christie: What Now? is on a UK tour.One show marked the bleakest point of my entire comedy career. Five people came and they’d won their tickets off the radio. After 15 minutes, they all walked out together, leaving just me and the tech guy. That was an interesting philosophical dilemma. Was this still a show? Should I just keep on going? Maybe they’ve all gone for a wee and will come back?When a team goes out of the World Cup, there’s this crouched position players go into where they just stare at a fixed point. I recall doing that. My tech hugged me and we had 45 minutes to kill, so we went for the maximum amount of beer you can drink in that time.In Edinburgh you always have another show the next night so there isn’t too long to lick your wounds. Some nights the show absolutely flew. There is no such thing as an overnight success in comedy. It takes years to get any good. You’re forged in fire. And Edinburgh is the hottest fire of all.David O’Doherty: You Have to Laugh is at Assembly George Square theatre.My first solo show was called What Would Beyoncé Do? and it was life-changing. I was performing above a pub, an incredibly sweaty 60-seater. The first time I showed up, there was a queue. “What are you here for?” I asked. They replied: “The Beyoncé show.” I was like: “Oh, OK! Wait there!” I ended up having to turn away 70 to 80 people a night, if not more. It got ridiculous. When the judges for the comedy awards first came, they couldn’t get in.Luisa Omielan: Politics for Bitches is at Gilded Balloon Teviot.It was 2011 and I was in a midday show called The Lunchtime Club. The Tron, where we were performing, was broken into one night so John Kearns – one of my three fellow performers – went on stage the next day and pretended to be a policeman. He interrogated the audience and they loved it.You’d smash it one day and die on your arse the next. But that’s the best way to learn. I remember being in awe of people who were doing a full hour. I did 15 minutes a day with the Lunchtime Club and we got one review that said: “I’d be astounded if any of these comedians becomes a professional comic.”Suzi Ruffell: Nocturnal is at the Pleasance Courtyard.Worryingly, I was given a 120-seat venue. I sold out once in the course of the month and was delighted. Then I got a review so scathing and personal I can almost repeat it word-for-word a decade later. Weirdly, it still gave me three stars. I remember that first fringe being the most intense thing I’d ever done, but at the end of it people told me I’d had a really good year. I thought: “I don’t want to know what a bad year feels like.” And then the following year I found out.Felicity Ward: Busting a Nut is at the Pleasance Courtyard.I was reading modern and medieval languages at Cambridge and in 1979 hitchhiked to Edinburgh to perform with the university’s Mummers troupe. I played Jack Dapper in A Roaring Girl, a kind of proto-feminist Jacobean play. There was a kids’ show, too, a duologue by Stephen Fry, and Simon McBurney was there as well. It was a charmed time. We were all young and beautiful, 18 of us sleeping in the same space in a rented flat. We won the Scotsman’s Fringe First award.Edinburgh is still a joyous and exciting place to be. The fringe programme is now 14ft thick but back then it was very slim indeed. In 1981 I was lucky enough to work with Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson when we did the Cellar Tapes revue. It won the inaugural Perrier award. It was televised on BBC2 which was great. What else did we get? A case of Perrier each and a London run in the New End theatre in Hampstead which was a converted morgue with a capacity of about 70. But it was still gorgeousTony Slattery’s Crimes Against Improv is at the Stand and Slattery Will Get You Nowhere is at the Stand’s New Town theatre.I was on a mixed bill of rookie comics. After a few days, the reality of the situation dawned on me: I was paying a fortune to sleep in a cupboard and perform to 10 drunks a night in a temporarily repurposed Sea Cadets hut. And that day I’d spent three hours out in the rain, attempting to hand out pictures of myself to impervious tourists.I snapped. I sat on the steps behind my venue and sobbed. But after that cathartic cry, things started to improve. I realised that having to adapt my act to fluctuations in audience size and sobriety was teaching me resilience, and that being at the bottom of the performing pile meant the only way was up.Glorious drunken nights followed, including furtive kisses round the back of the Gilded Balloon and many chip suppers. I wept at Waverley station when it was time to go back to Manchester – and I’ve been on the emotional rollercoaster that is the fringe ever since.Lucy Porter: Pass It On is at Pleasance Courtyard.I was doing street theatre with Jez Benstock but I can’t remember a single thing we did. Not a single joke, not even if we wore costumes. The only thing I can say for certain is that it was 1982 and we earned next to no money. I have a tiny, tiny memory of being stared at with a bit more confusion and aggression than Jez, because I wasn’t Scottish. That’s it. But it couldn’t have been that terrible as I’ve been back nearly 20 times.David Baddiel’s AniMalcolm is at the Gilded Balloon Teviot.I was MC for a London outfit called Screaming Blue Murder. They took comics up to Edinburgh every year for a package show so a bunch of us went up in 1995. The company put us all up. The only thing we had to do was flyer for three hours a day. That was my first experience of flyering and I wouldn’t like to go back. There’s nothing more disheartening than someone taking a flyer, looking at it, looking at your face, then uttering the words: “Are you funny?” Then you have 30 seconds to sell your show before watching them walk off down the Royal Mile, crumpling your flyer and throwing it to the ground.One year, I was performing at the Gilded Balloon and the entire building had a fire alarm. Like the pied piper, I led my audience out and continued the show standing on a crate. I spotted all the other comics who’d had to abandon their shows. So we just did an impromptu live gig there. Daniel Kitson, John Bishop – everyone did five minutes. That’s the spirit of the festival.The Stephen K Amos Talk Show is at the Gilded Balloon Teviot and out on Audible this month.My very first Edinburgh was in a sketch show in 1982. The next year I went up on my own doing standup, sandwiched between Arnold Brown and Norman Lovett. I used to psyche myself up in a cupboard all day just so I could get on stage and do my set about periods and masturbation, two words that apparently sounded very middle class when I said them – which could have been down to timing or because I was middle class. I didn’t win the Perrier award but I did develop a nasty strain of thrush due to drinking 10 lagers a night.Helen Lederer: I Might As Well Say It is at the Underbelly.Ken Campbell had written me a play. He called it an “x-rated one-woman ventriloquial farce”. I’d done two sold-out shows in London so I was excited. But in Edinburgh, all I can remember is four people and either Ken or my dad in the audience. I was scared of Ken because he was such a formidable intellect and had a fierce temper. I was trying to do my best doing all these voices and would tell him: “You’ve written something that is impossible, what can I do?” He’d say: “I’m not interested in anything less than you doing the impossible. That’s what I want!” Monkey, a puppet I still use, was in that show. Ken had made him be in love with me, which I found disgusting. I felt like I knew what Monkey should say. I did five minutes on my own with Monkey in Nicholas Parsons’ show and got laughs. So the next year I went back and did standup.Nina Conti is Monkey is at the Underbelly.I did a show in what was effectively a derelict building. It had seven venues spread over three floors, with hundreds of people coming in and out every hour, but not a single toilet and no running water. For the first few shows, I had no microphone so had to shout. I quickly lost my voice.The Birthday Girls, a sketch group, were performing in the “room” next door (ie on the other side of a black curtain). They had songs in their act and I had to rewrite my material so that the punchlines came during the quieter bits inbetween.I bought hundreds of party poppers for the audience to use to drown out the deafening noise from the Edinburgh Tattoo fireworks that went off at the same time every bloody night. So the show basically became a terrible and unintentional piece of performance art.Viv Groskop: Vivalicious is at the Underbelly.I was running a youth club and working for the BBC as a gag writer. One of the guys I was working with, Danny Robbins, invited me to do five minutes in character within his show. It was in a Portakabin in the Pleasance. Well, I say in the Pleasance – it was like walk through the Pleasance Courtyard where all the fun stuff is, keep walking, past the bins, behind the carpark and the train tracks. And just when you think the Pleasance is completely finished, it was there. People would never find it. The show was terribly promoted. We’d have eight or 10 people a night. Halfway through the run, I wrote a little rap and started promoting it myself around the courtyard.The festival is like New Year’s Eve every night. It’s very hard to be professional because there’s so much fun to be had. There was a lot of heavy drinking, late nights, a severe lack of sleep. And, because I was only doing five minutes a day, I felt no reason to be disciplined.Doc Brown stars in Cleaning Up, a new ITV drama with Sheridan Smith.There were seven of us in the show and we called ourselves Club Seals. I was doing standup in a double act and doing it solo as well. I ended up winning the BBC New Comedian award – because I was performing every night, twice, as a standup and I’d do other venues, too, like the Bearpit. I was match fit and loving it.We asked Newcastle Brown Ale to sponsor our show. They saidour name trivialised an atrocity. We thought that was terribly funny so got T-shirts saying: “Club Seals – trivialising an atrocity since 1996.”Marcus Brigstocke: Devil May Care is at the Pleasance Courtyard.I remember the smells of Edinburgh – hops, beer, baked potatoes. The tatty shop was just down the road from where we played. We lived on them. It was 1978, the end of my second year at Cambridge, and we were in a Footlights revue directed by Clive Anderson. There were six of us: four blokes and two women in a show called Stagefright. We all had to wear white jeans and white shirts with a different coloured tie, which was more flattering for the men than the women. Clive is very good at comedy and the rhythm of jokes. He’d written a lot of the show. I had a song which was like a parody of Tammy Wynette. I had a bright pink dress and a blonde wig. It was about Margaret Thatcher.

When I first got there, I went to the Pleasance Courtyard. It was six in the evening. I saw all the people to-ing and fro-ing, saw the menu board of comedy shows and got really intimidated.

In October, she will be the main guest at the Institute of Contemporary Arts dinner, which is being held in her honour.The UK-based company, an offshoot of an American military contractor called SCL Group, offered electoral services to politicians across the world, including the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns in the US. Publicly, this included creating and buying digital advertising privately, according to claims made in secret filming by then-CEO Alexander Nix, it may have extended to honeytrap stings and other dark arts. (Nix now denies CA used such methods.)That depends on your definition of work. The company was listed as a partner on Leave.EU\u0027s application to become the official Brexit campaign, and carried out some preparatory studies. But both companies say no contract was ever signed, nor money paid, and that the exploratory work wasn\u0027t used in the eventual referendum campaign.While working on the Cruz campaign in the 2016 US election, Cambridge Analytica partnered with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, to explore psychographics, a marketing practice that involves psychologically profiling iniduals and tailoring adverts to their personalities. Kogan used an app tied in to Facebook to download data from 800,000 users – and around 70 million of their friends – and used that data as the basis of his psychographic model.Two-and-a-half years after\u0026nbspthe first report in the \u0026nbspof Kogan\u0027s use of Facebook data, the company responded, banning Kogan and Cambridge Analytica from its platform and launching an investigation into misuse of its site.The Information Commissioner announced an intention to levy a £500,000 fine, the maximum possible, against Facebook for two breaches of data protection laws.The whistleblower has been asked to talk about the rise of artificial intelligence, the state of the data economy and the role of algorithms in public policy. She will also talk about Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and harvested raw data from up to 87m Facebook profiles.Other issues that will be discussed by the former US army intelligence analyst include the Panama Papers, documents showing the myriad ways in which the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes.Manning was invited to attend the event by Stefan Kalmár, who was appointed director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2016. He came to the ICA from Artists Space in New York and was described at the time by an art world insider as a “true innovator”.Talking about the decision to hold the dinner in Manning’s honour, he said: “I am very excited.”He explained that he had tried to reconnect the ICA to its original funding mission. “It was always a social, political radical engaged organisation. It was also always outspoken,” he said. “The underlining agenda was always that we connect culture production to social and political meaning and, I hope, show that the power of an inidual can change the world through bravery, courage, determination and vision. We could not be happier to welcome Chelsea to London.”Kalmár said Manning wanted to talk about empowerment of commercial software used in warfare and artificial intelligence.Since her release from prison, Manning has said pressures and difficulties with mainstream outlets had forced her to send the documents directly to WikiLeaks but she has never apologised or expressed regret.Manning said her time in prison had “a lot of long-term effects” on her but that she did not fully understand them. “It’s been slow. It’s been very difficult for me to recognise the things going on.”Her prison sentence was cut short and she was released in 2017 after Barack Obama intervened. Within a year, she threw herself into an unsuccessful run in the Democratic primary for a Maryland Senate seat.Manning will also talk at the dinner about queer and transgender rights and her role supporting defendants who were part of the anti-capitalist Disrupt J20 protest.

The deal will allow Facebook to show all 380 matches for the new season, which starts on Friday, to users in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Males, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.Facebook will show the games for free to its 348 million users in the region, including 270 million in India. The company did not disclose how much it was paying for the rights, which cost Sony Pictures Network $32m (£25m) last time they were for sale in 2014.Facebook and other US technology companies have been buying up rights to popular sports for streaming services. Competition from cash-rich US tech companies is a threat to cable and satellite TV broadcasters, which have used sport as a way to attract and keep customers.Facebook pays about $1m a game to show 25 Major League Baseball games worldwide for no fee, supported by advertising. From next season in the UK, Amazon will bundle 20 English Premier League matches with its Prime subscription service. Sky and BT currently share the rights to show live games on TV.Peter Hutton, Facebook’s director of global live sports, told Reuters its La Liga streams would be free of advertising at first but that it was considering its options. He said the La Liga deal was an experiment and not part of a land grab of sports rights.“This is one deal,” Hutton told Reuters. “It’s not something that is a big threat to broadcast world.”The deal is La Liga’s latest effort to expand its fanbase in India, where it opened an office in New Delhi in 2016.Jose Antonio Cachaza, La Liga’s country manager for India, said: “This is the first step for us. We’re excited to see it and we want make it as successful as possible so we can unlock other territories around the world.”India and the surrounding south Asian countries are a crucial untapped market for Facebook, which has hit saturation point in the US and most of western Europe. The social network already has over 241 million users in India alone – the largest single country user base for Facebook, exceeding its 240 million US users – but there is plenty of room for growth.India’s population passed 1.3 billion people in 2017 and is expected to hit 1.5 billion by 2030. Meanwhile about 500 million people in India are expected to be internet-connected this year, in a country that is primarily mobile first and has relatively affordable mobile data.Facebook has already had some setbacks in India as it strives to reach chief executive Mark Zuckberg’s goal of connecting “the next five billion people”. In a coalition with Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera, Nokia and Qualcomm, called Internet.org, Facebook launched its Free Basics service in India in 2015 with local mobile network Reliance Communications.The service provided free internet access to select sites, including Facebook but excluding competitors. It was banned from India by the nation’s Telecom Regulatory Authority in 2016 for breaching net neutrality rules.Since then Facebook has launched its Watch video on-demand service, Watch, in the US – a rival to Google’s YouTube and Netflix, it features original shows viewed through its site.Facebook is said to be planning to launch Watch in India this year, according to a report from local news outlet The Ken, as a way to entice the other 250 million-plus internet-connected people in India on to its main social-networking platform.Last year Facebook failed in its attempts to acquire the rights to Indian Premier League cricket with a $610m bid. The La Liga rights may make a suitable alternative vehicle with which to launch Watch in India."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5735d590edaf1bea2341eedb01fcb13e5f2b9740/0_160_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83cf82fb8dbdf690e4c3555324fad19e","title":"how to turn off google location tracking","story":"Turning off location history won’t hide where you are when you use search, Maps or weather.

Once it was simply a place where two very patient, mild-mannered anchors could repeat the same four news stories every half an hour until you went to work.But Piers has upset the order. Because now breakfast television is largely a receptacle for berkish blokes who want to belch and groan their own dumb opinions at length regardless of the situation. Forget news, it’s gaffes that people want. It’s post-show virality. That’s why, when Piers Morgan has a day off, Good Morning Britain brings in Richard Madeley. And it’s why, if Piers Morgan and Richard Madeley both have a day off at the same time, Good Morning Britain will hire a chimp, or a dog in a hat, or a Teddy Ruxpin loaded up with an Anthrax cassette to take their place.Compared to the bonk-headed pyrotechnics on ITV, BBC Breakfast has always been relatively sedate. But that also might be about to change. Because, and this is hugely exciting to report, Dan Walker has just stepped up. If everything goes according to plan, Walker might just emerge as the new breakfast villain of our time.On and on and on it went. But most people know to never engage with this sort of online buffoonery, because you can never win an argument with an idiot. Walker, though, lost his damn mind. Five hours later, he clapped back with a furiously itemised list of all his mug-based grievances. “1. It’s a mug 2. It’s LICENCE 3. They cost about £1.50 each 4. That’s a grand total of £3 for the 2 we use every day 5. Did I mention it’s a mug? 6. I hope you’re not doing anything ‘frivolous’ like drinking tea today 7. Thanks for watching.”If this seems familiar, it’s because it’s almost exactly what happened during the World Cup, when he posted a video of a bear in a football shirt putting balls in a barrel. “I think he might be an #England fan,” Walker quipped, to the widespread horror of hundreds of people who saw the clip as Walker condoning animal cruelty. Walker’s reaction, again, was to wig out. “Please listen. I do NOT think this is cool, funny or clever. I do think it’s VILE. I do not think it should be ignored. I felt – perhaps foolishly – that it would be obvious I thought it was disgusting but I can see the reason for confusion from the tone,” he sniffed, before confusing the tone further by using the hashtag #SaveTheBear and a thumbs up emoji.To be clear, I am all for Walker’s behaviour. BBC Breakfast still routinely gets more viewers than Good Morning Britain, but it lacks a breakout star. This might just be Walker’s opportunity to shine. Until now he’s just been a mildly anaemic, Tim Lovejoyish bloke-lite of a presenter. But by revealing his short fuse, he’s finally given the producers something to exploit. It is my honest opinion that all breakfast TV producers want is a clip that will blow up once the show has ended, like when Madeley shouted at Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, or whenever you see Susanna Reid sadly reassess all her life decisions midway through the 10th Piers Morgan rant of the day. And Walker is the man who’ll provide this for the BBC.BBC Breakfast, please lean into this. If you have any sense, you’ll spend every episode gently goading Walker. Mess with his autocue a little. Make him interview 20 crying toddlers at once. Fill his mug with bees. Anything, so long as it makes him lose his temper on air, because then we’ll all spend a day laughing about it on Twitter, and he’ll become a star and you’ll reinforce your ratings superiority. Dan Walker is quite clearly a gaffe king in waiting. Perhaps it’s time for a coronation.

Xi Jinping, China’s president, and other officials have warned separatist activity will not be tolerated.Small groups of pro-Beijing and pro-democracy protesters gathered outside the Foreign Correspondents’ Club building in Hong Kong before and during the speech by Andy Chan of the Hong Kong National party. Some pro-Beijing protesters carried banners saying “Hong Kong independence is poisonous”.Current and former Hong Kong leaders have criticised the FCC for hosting Chan, whose party is facing a possible ban on national security grounds.Chan told the FCC audience: “Sadly, we are a nation that is quickly being annexed and destroyed by China. The cry for Hong Kong independence is therefore a cry against colonial invasion.”The Chinese government criticised the FCC for hosting Chan, comparing Hong Kong’s pro-independence advocates to Nazis in Germany and terrorists in the US. It said governments had the right to restrict expression of ideas that threatened social order.“No country will allow foreign institutions to invite separatist forces on their own land to advocate splitting the country and inciting violent resistance,” the statement said. During his talk, Chan said he condemned violence in political action.The 75-year-old FCC has previously hosted politicians and newsmakers, including pro-Beijing speakers, at its clubhouse in central Hong Kong. The club says it believes its members and the public have the right “to hear the views of different sides in any debate”.The perception that Beijing is reneging on its promise of semi-autonomy, and eroding Hong Kong’s free elections and freedom of speech, is helping nurture a generation of young activists calling for greater autonomy, if not outright independence.Huge pro-democracy protests erupted in 2014 in response to the decision by China’s ruling Communist party to retain the right to effectively pre-screen candidates for Hong Kong’s leadership.Hong Kong officials have dismissed the FCC’s argument that Chan’s appearance amounts to a free speech matter, with the territory’s former chief executive Leung Chun-ying equating the club staging the event with giving a platform to “criminals and terrorists”.The current Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, told reporters on Sunday it was “inappropriate” for the FCC to host Chan and asked the organisation to respect that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f48a842f1597dd9d640dd745e69b57cbf30c08e/0_202_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=745cc1f6841dc0aed8a623c7697f1667","title":"new zealand to consider miscarriage leave for parents in bid to tackle taboo subject","story":"Women and their partners could be entitled to three days of paid bereavement leave after a miscarriage or stillbirthA bill legislating three days’ paid bereavement leave for women and their partners after a miscarriage will be considered by New Zealand’s parliament.The Labour MP Ginny Andersen, who sponsored the bill, said miscarriage was still a “taboo subject” in New Zealand and paid leave to grieve for the loss of a baby – at any stage of the pregnancy – would bring the subject into the open. The proposed bill also covers stillbirths.At present, New Zealanders are entitled to bereavement leave after the loss of a family member or child but that does not include the loss of a child who is not born alive.The ministry of health describes miscarriages as “fairly common” and says one or two out of every 10 pregnant women will miscarry a baby.“The lack of clarity has meant some women have been in the position of having to argue with their employer about whether they are entitled to leave because they have lost their unborn child,” said Andersen.“A lot of women have had more than one miscarriage and it can be very traumatic and difficult if you are trying to hold down a job.”Andersen said anyone who had a “confirmed pregnancy” would be entitled to the leave, but there would likely need to be some discussion over how a pregnancy would be confirmed. Once it was confirmed, a miscarriage at any stage of the pregnancy would be eligible for the bereavement leave.Iain Lees-Galloway, the minister for workplace relations and safety, said he would support the bill and that it reflected the government’s “compassionate, people-centred and progressive approach” to politics.“A miscarriage is a terrible time for parents and this bill provides certainty for parents and employers around the definition of a miscarriage so that parents can grieve and spend time to work through the personal toll of a miscarriage,” said Lees-Galloways.Kathryn van Beek, who approached several MPs to sponsor the bill, had a miscarriage two years ago. Afterwards she discovered many New Zealand women had struggled to get time off to grieve and process their loss.“Not everyone who miscarries will experience grief and feel as though they need to access bereavement leave, but for those who do it is important they have the option and it is legislated,” she said.Andersen said she expected cross-party support from NZ First and the Greens for her bill, and had also had warm and positive responses from a number of opposition National MPs. “A lot of people are saying this is a very sensible idea, and we want to take the politics out of this one and have the whole house support it.”Some other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman gives birth to a stillborn baby. In the Canadian province of Ontario if a woman loses a baby 17 weeks or less before her due date she is entitled to 17 weeks of unpaid pregnancy leave.In the UK a miscarriage before the end of the 24th week of pregnancy does not qualify for bereavement leave, but a stillborn child born after this date means the mother is entitled to maternity leave and associated pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcc41f4e5a3a79094f43aaf2bfab9d6e91c76759/0_373_5602_3361/master/5602.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2d0bbf54d8ed7ea7c836e2972db0ece","title":"niger suppresses dissent as us leads influx of foreign armies","story":"The western presence in one of the most militarised countries in Africa has sparked frustration and fear in localsby  Ruth Maclean in Niamey and Agadez and  Omar Hama SaleyThe demonstration was planned for 4pm on 15 April, a warm Sunday afternoon in the somnolent Nigerien capital. The protesters had two main complaints: rising taxes and the fact that, in recent years, some of the world’s most powerful armies had descended on their country.But before the civil society leaders could even get to the march, they were arrested.When a group of heavily armed men on motorbikes killed four American special ops soldiers in remote Niger last October, it was the first many had heard of the war the US was helping fight against a local branch of Isis.But their involvement in that fight represents only a fraction of the US presence in the west African country, poor but strategically located in the middle of the Sahel, its borders crisscrossed by extremists and traffickers.And the 800 US defence personnel in Niger are not alone. They are one of four western armies that have installed themselves in the vast desert landscape, variously flying armed drones, hunting militants, building vast bases, controlling migration and collecting intelligence from the region.This is what the April protest was about.Ibrahim Diori was arrested at home, and Maïkou Zodi in his car, both charged with participation in a banned demonstration and destruction of public property, even though they were not present. Today, they are in jail awaiting trial, along with colleagues arrested over previous marches.The Nigerien government allows foreign powers free rein to build military bases and send soldiers to defend their interests in the region, while suppressing any dissent, according to those civil society leaders not in jail, and key opposition figures.“Today there’s terrible repression of those who are against the government line. They put seven of my colleagues in prison because we said no to foreign bases,” said Mariama Bayard, leader of the opposition. She said that the government was “illegitimate” because the main challenger, Hama Amadou, was in jail at the time of the last election, and that it was being propped up by foreigners in the absence of domestic support.“Dictatorship is taking hold of this country. The people don’t want the bases. But the Sahel has become an important geo-strategic space for the great powers,” she said.According to Bayard, foreign powers do not have permission to build bases in their country.“Our constitution says that before a base can be installed, parliament has to accept it. It’s a deal between the government and these foreign powers. It’s illegal, the bases are illegal.”With Boko Haram in the south-east, Isis-linked ISGS on the Malian border, and a chaotic Libya to the north, Niger is surrounded by violent extremists.As part of its counter-terrorism mission Operation Barkhane, France has 500 soldiers on its base in Niamey, and more on its bases in Madama and Aguelal. Germany has 50 soldiers in Niamey to support the UN peacekeeping force in Mali, and is expanding accommodation to cater for more on the airbase it shares with France. Canadian soldiers come and go.Italy has an advance team of 40 soldiers in the country, preparing for the arrival of up to 430 more troops who will “train, advise and assist” local forces to fight illicit trafficking, mostly of migrants. Many of the 640,000 refugees who have arrived in Italy since 2014 came through Niger.But it is the US, with its armed drones targeting militants including al-Qaeda leaders in Libya, that has attracted the most attention.The three giant white hangars of Airbase 201, the new US base near the centuries-old city of Agadez, which is costing $100m  (£78m) to build, stand on a long stretch of sand that is prone to puddles  local herders used to take their goats to drink there in rainy season.Some of these herders, living a few hundred metres away from the base’s new fences, said they had never met their new neighbours, though they often saw them whizzing past in air-conditioned SUVs, or by night, the shadow of their aircraft crossing the moon.“They don’t help us. I’ve always been poor, and I’m still poor,” said Sedefiou Abdou, who had never heard of America until the base came to his neighbourhood. References to Obama, Trump and Coca Cola drew a blank. Then he was played a snippet of a French cover of the wildly popular Latin hit Despacito, and his face finally lit up in recognition. Apart from the airbase, this was the closest America came to penetrating into his corner of the Sahel.Abdou had no more need of this knowledge than most Americans do for Niger’s rich and complex culture the two countries are thousands of miles apart. But his government and theirs were firm friends, as the Nigerien president said in an interview at his palace in Niamey, where former presidents deposed in Niger’s many coups gaze down from their portraits on the building’s high white arches.“I don’t like the term ‘foreign forces’ – they’re friendly forces, who will leave as soon as we want them to,” said Mahamadou Issoufou. “They’re here at our request, and once the need for them disappears, they’ll leave.”Issoufou recognised that they were also looking after their own interests, however.“They’re not just here for us. They do it for themselves. The countries who have sent their armies know that once the Sahel is conquered, the threat will concern them, will concern Europe. It’s a way of preventing that threat from spreading into their territory.”Civil society leaders and rights groups say protests against this and any controversial government policies have been “almost systematically denied”, while pro-government marches are allowed. Detained civil society leaders have been spread out in jails across the country.According to Boulama Hamadou Tcherno, one of the few civil society leaders who was not arrested in the March and April crackdowns, there has been silence from the nations in a position to put pressure on the government.“We’re very worried about what will happen in the next few years. Freedom to demonstrate, freedom of religion – even praying to God is forbidden. And all the big democratic powers turn their gaze away.” put the allegations that America is in effect propping up an illegitimate and repressive government to Thomas Waldhauser, the head of US Africa Command, in an interview at a small American base in Senegal last week.He emphasised that there had been “a lot of aid and security force assistance” in recent years and said that was why the US was there, as well as to help the country maintain its borders.Speaking more generally about the US presence in Africa, he said US troops were trying to “prevent something from spreading and happening before it actually does”.According to opponents of the foreign bases, however, they do not stop terrorists but attract them.“We see no results from their presence on the ground in fact we have the impression that terrorism has increased since they arrived. Are they really here to help our soldiers?” Tcherno asked.Bayard agreed. “They are creating the conditions for the Sahel to blow up,” she said. “They say that the bases are here for our security, but the opposite is true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d73968c596b503fa8997c8c8bb7b7ee9edff0b/0_265_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c7971809800959c05e488456b85e3cf","title":"what god has not joined together the rise of the humanist wedding","story":"Secular marriages are now the most popular in Scotland, prompting fresh calls for reform in England and WalesRobyn Hewatt and Andrew Downie were married with all the trappings of a traditional Scottish wedding: Hewatt’s father walked her down the aisle she had maids of honour and Downie had a best man. A piper played at the door.But there was no priest, minister or registrar to lead the ceremony. Like thousands of Scots, Hewatt and Downie were legally married by a humanist celebrant. For the first time last year, in what was once a famously religious country, the Humanist Society of Scotland married more people than the Church of Scotland.Hewatt, 29, a gym instructor, and Downie, 34, a manager with the Screwfix chain, said their wedding on Saturday fitted their identity. “We felt we could make it more personal to us and our story. A humanist ceremony spoke more to us than a more traditional religious type of ceremony,” Downie said.The catalyst for this dramatic shift came in 2005 when the then registrar general of Scotland changed the law on human rights grounds to allow humanist celebrants to conduct weddings. Scotland categorises humanist weddings as a non-religious belief ceremony, with the same legal status as church-based and civil marriages. Humanists include atheists and agnostics, and those who say they are spiritual but who dislike organised religion. They embrace same-sex marriage, too, unlike most mainstream churches.And since 2005 they have mushroomed: in 2017, there were 5,912 humanist weddings with 3,283 conducted by Humanist Society celebrants compared with just 3,166 by the Church of Scotland. With couples barred from legally marrying with a humanist wedding in England and Wales, some now travel to Scotland to be married, and at least four humanist celebrants from England are hoping for approval to carry out legal marriages in Scotland.Hewatt and Downie were married by Caroline Lambie, 47, who was brought up in the Scottish Episcopalian church, a branch of Anglicanism, before deciding at an early age she was agnostic. Lambie was herself married at a humanist wedding in 2007.“Being secular makes sense for most couples I work with,” she said. “These couples say to me that they would feel hypocritical if they did have a church wedding as they have no religious beliefs.”Prof Callum Brown, a historian at the University of Glasgow and an expert in secularism, believes the country has the highest rate globally of humanist weddings. “Scotland is leading the world in non-religious belief weddings,” Brown said. “I know of no other country where it is anywhere near so high.”This summer humanist weddings were legally recognised for the first time in Jersey and in Northern Ireland – a place still dominated by religious faith, heaping further pressure on ministers in London to finally authorise humanist weddings in England and Wales.Humanists UK, the body which covers England and Wales, is planning to take the UK government to court on human rights grounds in an effort to force reform. Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, said: “The continual failure to recognise humanist marriages in England and Wales not only makes these jurisdictions seem antiquated compared to the rest of the country, but fails to uphold the principle of equality embedded in our human rights settlement.”Brown said the decline in religious weddings and church attendance generally could be seen across Europe and the industrialised west, especially among whites. It was fuelled first by the advancement of women’s rights in the 1960s, which increased women’s education and economic independence.More couples chose to cohabit, never marrying or doing so later in life, he said. Progressively fewer people attend church and fewer still have their children baptised. He added Scotland had a long tradition of Sunday opening for shops, something liberalised in England and Wales only relatively recently.Brown saidthe rate of decline in religious involvement in Scotland had been far faster and more pronounced than in other parts of the UK. It had experienced “a dramatic change from the closed-mind Presbyterianism” which once dominated Scottish life, he said.Churches are privately critical of the humanist trend, suggesting it is a pick-and-mix form of consumerism, sometimes using Christian iconography such as crosses even though humanist events are intended to be secular.Yet Rev Dr George Whyte, the principal clerk at the Church of Scotland, said his church had failed to market its increasingly liberal approach to weddings. The Church of England, by contrast, has a slick and cheery website devoted to selling its religious marriages: yourchurchwedding.org.Whyte pointed out that couples no longer needed to be members of the church vows could be personalised and marriages conducted outside the church. There are no longer rules stipulating brides needed to enter first or be given away by their father."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book. But first, maybe go read one.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/10/rtx2sh01.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1587  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/10/rtx2sh01.jpg","title":"mike ashley house of fraser sports direct store closures","story":"Created with Sketch.The retail tycoon plans to introduce more luxury brands at the department store, including Gucci and PradaClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe retailer had previously announced the closure of 31 out of its total 59 stores, but the new owner told the Sun that he will try to keep most of the branches open.  “In a year’s time you can hold my feet to the fire on that,” he said.

In the weeks after the blaze, Mr Javid admitted the Tories had “failed” on housing and promised a “fundamental rethink”.Publishing the document, the government said it was prioritising ensuring social homes are safe and good quality, and giving tenants the power to hold landlords to account.As part of this,\u0026nbspthe social housing regulator will be given new powers to intervene and ensure landlords are maintaining homes to a decent standard. The process of dealing with tenants’ complaints will also be sped up.League tables could\u0026nbspalso be used to assess\u0026nbsplandlords based on how well their properties are maintained and how they treat tenants.Separately, legislation will be introduced to protect the rights of domestic violence victims who have been given a social home for life.Ministers said they were\u0026nbspalso prioritising tackling the stigma around social housing, and increasing the overall number of social homes being built.They have launched a separate consultation of how councils are spending the money they receive from selling homes through the right to buy scheme, which critics say\u0026nbspis a major cause of the diminishing number of social homes in the UK.Less than half of the revenue\u0026nbspgenerated by right to buy sales currently goes\u0026nbsptowards the cost of building new homes. Instead, almost a fifth goes to the Treasury and a quarter is used by councils to pay off debts.Ninety per cent fewer social homes are being built now than when the Conservatives\u0026nbspcame to power in 2010, while 230,000 low cost homes are forecast to be lost between 2010 and 2020.More than 8,000 people have already fed into the government’s green paper, and more views will be sought during the consultation period, which is set to close in November.Publication of the document\u0026nbsphad already been delayed by several weeks, leading to it being released in the middle of parliament’s summer break.Labour said the proposals in the paper would do nothing to increase the supply of social homes.John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: “This\u0026nbsppitiful document reveals a government that has run out of ideas on housing. Nothing in this green paper measures up to the scale of the housing crisis.“The number of new social rented homes is at a record low but there is no new money to increase supply, and ministers are still preventing local authorities run by all parties from building the council homes their communities need.“After eight years of failure on housing, ministers should back Labour’s long-term plan for a million new genuinely affordable homes over 10\u0026nbspyears.”Number of social homes to fall by 230,000 by 2020, analysis revealsFewer social homes being built than at any time since Second World WarMore than 500,000 social homes fail basic health and safety standardsCouncil leaders also said the plan did not go far enough.Judith Blake, the Local Government Association’s\u0026nbsphousing\u0026nbspspokesperson, said: “This green paper is a step towards delivering more\u0026nbspsocial\u0026nbsphomes but it is only a small step, compared with the huge and immediate need for more genuinely affordable homes.“There is a desperate need to reverse the decline in council\u0026nbsphousing\u0026nbspover the past few decades.”She added: “The government must go beyond the limited measures announced so far, scrap the\u0026nbsphousing\u0026nbspborrowing cap\u0026nbspand enable all councils\u0026nbspacross the country\u0026nbspto borrow to build once more.“This would trigger a\u0026nbsprenaissance in council house-building, which will help people to access genuinely affordable\u0026nbsphousing.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/Stone-stacking-1003231.jpg","title":"stone stacking environment blue planet society","story":"Stone stackers are under fire from environmentalists (Image: )The Blue Planet Society says stone stacking near beaches is ruining beauty spots and disturbing the breeding grounds of shore-nesting birds.The organisation said the practice has reached \u0026ldquoepidemic proportions.But stone stacking enthusiasts have hit back, arguing the hobby is \u0026ldquovery good for the mind, body and spirit and restoring the soul.Blue Planet Society founder John Hourston is worried about the effect piling up stones is having on the environment.

She blasted: \u0026ldquoLet me finish!\u0026ldquoThat is investigated by the Electoral Commission, which has happened in this case, she added.\u0026ldquoAnd when the Electoral Commission has concerns that criminal activities have happened, they report that to the police and that is being investigated.\u0026nbspThat happens in lots of elections.The former Labour Director of Communications believes there are growing calls in the UK for another\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote because the situation is now completely different to two years ago.He said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThere is a sense of people whether they voted Remain or Leave thinking this is just a mess and it is not going well.\u0026ldquoThe negotiations are going badly, the promises that were made are not being kept, things that we were told were going to happen aren\u0026rsquot happening, things that we were told weren\u0026rsquot going to happen are happening.\u0026ldquoThe country is starting to think well hold on a minute this is not quite what we thought was going to happen and there is a desperation amongst Brexiteers because I think they worry that if there was a Peoples Vote on the outcome of the negotiations that it would be rejected, they are right to worry.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn about her reality TV romances rarely last beyond the first glossy magazine spread.I’M not in the least bit surprised that doctors don’t trust us to tell the truth when it comes to how much booze we guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be watching from behind the sofa to find out the fate of our heroine June.She inhabits a world where women have no rights, and handmaids are ritually raped, mutilated and even killed.It’s not easy viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional rollercoaster and Miss Moss should clear her sideboard for a slew of awards.The Handmaid’s Tale, Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm.WHAT sad news to discover that Margot Kidder, who shone so very brightly as the feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for likening woman who wear burkas to letter boxes.It’s his opinion.You very well might disagree, but getting him to say sorry won’t make him stop thinking such thoughts.He will just stop writing and uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats when I called Sarah and asked her to book me a flight home.Alun revealed that Sarah wasnt best pleased when she first wound out what happened - but had since made him promise her a trip to Amsterdam as pay back.He said: She calls me out but our rows are always in good spirit.She text back saying You are winding me up, what an idiot.But finished off telling me to have a good time.The playful dad said Sarah wasnt a nagging girlfriend, adding: But she has said Ive got to take her away now to make up for it so we are looking at a trip to Amsterdam.Hopefully this time I can give my boss a bit more notice.It was thanks to Sarah that the pair managed to get home - booking the pair the first flight back.Sarah said: The best part is that I had to rescue the boys and get them a flight home when theyd had enough.People have messaged me saying Im a mug for forgiving him but there was no fall out.Its all been a big laugh and Im just glad he was safe and they stuck together even if they did go a bit too wild.The couple have been best mates for nearly three years and only recently took their relationship to the next level.They have now been seeing each other for 8 weeks and live around the corner from each other on the Gurnos estate in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.Dad-of-four Alun said: We love the banter, its one of the reasons we are great together.

In any other customer facing industry we’d be looking at proper refunds.”And Treasury aide Chris Philp insisted Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had to deliver on plans announced in June to give commuters on Southern a month’s worth of compensation.He said: “No one who has suffered should be paying more next year. People have paid for a service and it’s not been received.”Labour demanded a fare freeze on Sunday – and called for a windfall tax on train operators.Official inflation figures tomorrow are due to show retail prices rose by 3.5 per cent in July. The July figure is taken as the basis for annual fare hikes in January.A 3.5 per cent rise would push up season tickets for between London and Ashford by £188 to £5,567, London and Southampton by £200 to £5,902. A season ticket from Macclesfield to Manchester on troubled Northern Rail would also rise by £90 to £2,663.The hikes come after a summer marked by timetabling chaos and cancelled services across the country.Southern has warned passengers this week they face 34 days of disruption on the Brighton to London mainline from September due to “improvement” works. Fares across the UK have soared by 40 per cent over the past decade.The Department for Transport yesterday said that while further hikes were “unwelcome” they were essential to funding work on the railways. But Tories have urged the Government to follow ex-Chancellor George Osborne – who capped regulated rail fares in 2011.Insiders argue that unions must share part of the blame for soaring ticket prices as around 25p in every £1 spent goes on wages. Labour’s former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis said customer dissatisfaction was running at levels that would “shame” the likes of major supermarkets.He stormed: “Watchdogs Which? say that one in five rail passengers are dissatisfied with their last journey. Imagine that was a supermarket, with one in five dissatisfied with the last food they bought. Passengers shouldn’t be expected to pay more for worse.”After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here is part of the answer.“Either the Government have taken their eye off the ball or they have been too heavily influenced by a small group of companies and have ignored their own.”Migration Watch said that since 1992, the number of ICTs (inter-company transfers) has increased eightfold. In 1997 the Home Office issued around 15,000 to workers and their families.This jumped to 47,000 in 2007 and 58,000 last year.Two types of ICTs can be issued – from long-term staff visas to permits for graduate trainees.Migration Watch’s blast comes just weeks after official figures revealed non-EU immigration pushed net migration to nearly 300,000 in the first full year since the Brexit referendum.Net migration from EU nations fell to just over 100,000 in 2017 – the lowest level in five years.

What we would like to do is introduce a ‘concierge click and collect’ at House of Fraser.“When you go online and say you want to collect goods in-store, you should be able to book a time, book a changing room and book a stylist.“You get that kind of personal shopping service in a Harrods. There’s no reason why it couldn’t be rolled out nationally across House of Fraser.”Sports Direct, which already held an 11 per cent stake, bought House of Fraser outright just hours after it went into administration.It was left on the brink of collapse after the Chinese owner of toy store Hamleys pulled out of a £70million rescue deal.House of Fraser, which its new owner affectionately calls “HoF”, employs 17,000, including 11,500 in-store concession staff.Ashley, who is worth around £3billion, believes the key to securing its future is to introduce more luxury brands.He added that big-hitters such as Gucci, Prada, Stone Island and Mallet footwear were “the biggest thing missing” as House of Fraser ran into the red.Drawing on his experience with designer chain Flannels, which is owned by Sports Direct, he intends to stock House of Fraser with successful “cool brands of the moment”.He said: “We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands. We think it will make a big difference.“It is not taking away from House of Fraser, but adding to it.“If you get the right product, it is not on the shelves for long.”Larger House of Fraser stores, such as the one in Birmingham, could see whole floors turned over to Sports Direct or Flannels, Ashley added.Among the stores that could be saved from closure is the Oxford Street flagship in London — if landlords and suppliers can be won over.Ashley admitted that landlords have been “battered and bruised” by a raft of retail tenants seeking rent reductions this year.In a message to them, he said: “Give us a chance and we will try to keep as many open as we can. We are here to get House of Fraser back to where it once was.”However, some analysts are sceptical that the colourful billionaire can pull it off.Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb warned: “It is far from clear if he really knows what he has taken on.”HOUSE OF FRASER lost its way but Ashley wants to take it upmarket with more luxury bestsellers, brands popular with younger customers and a personal shopper service.SPORTS DIRECT’s superstores are full of popular brands, including Lonsdale and Donnay.

The mum and dad were doing them.We woke up the next day and thought it was hilarious. We sent pictures to our parents and and they were like that better not be permanent.It was absolutely fine until about eight days later then it was so itchy and it felt like it was burning.It was so red. It was all raised up. Now it looks a bit like eczema and is very dry.She went to a pharmacy when she got back to the UK and was told to go to a walk-in centre.Beth, who is taking a gap year after finishing her A-Levels this summer, added: I thought that was a bit extreme so I went to the doctor on the Monday.I said to them that I was probably overreacting but I needed to know if it was going to scar permanently because when I looked it up it said you needed to be treated for chemical burns.I was so worried it would scar me forever.The doctors told me Id had an allergic reaction to it and it would take about six months to go completely.Beth was prescribed a steroid cream and told that due to the chemicals in black henna also being used in hair dyes, she would no longer be able to dye her hair.She added: She [the pharmacist] was very firm on it because she said my body would start attacking whats in the hair dye and that I could actually die.That was the worst thing for me - not being able to dye my hair.Beth says everyone was shouting the phrase made popular by the character Jim on the show, which is about two brothers who return home for dinner with their parents every Friday night.Beth said: I love the show - its hilarious. Friday Night Dinner seems to be the thing that young people are obsessed with at the moment.It was everywhere in Zante. People would shout different lines back at each other.Warning others against the dangers, Beth said: I would 100 per cent say do not get black henna. If I would have known before I wouldnt have done it.

That’s not true. Many more people are going to live until they are 90.“Practically a third of your life will be lived in what we used to term retirement.And it’s not sustainable economically and it’s not sustainable personally either.”Mr Green was forced to resign late last year over claims of inappropriate behaviour and pornography on a Commons computer.Before that he was invloved in a review of social care for the elderly in Britain - branded the UK’s ticking time bomb.Health Secretary Matt Hancock will unveil his own proposals to tackle the spending shortfall later this year.It followed the Conservative’s lead balloon manifesto policy that meant people with assets of £100,000 or more would have to pay for their own care.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Posting on a Tory Whatsapp group she stormed: “Are the power that be determined to add insult to injury after the white paper, Boris, the PM letter and now this.”Marcus Fysh, a Eurosceptic who has called for the PM to go, added: “Uttterly moronic I’m afraid. The sooner this administration is changed the better.”They also hit out over the “Lib Dem Yellow” colour of the mailout – which explains how the Chequers proposal will end free movement, and the rule of the European Court of Justice.Brexit backers argue the PM’s plan to keep Britain in a single market for goods will force the UK to be subject to ECJ rulings for years.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice?

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire.

But I can tell some of them are thinking ‘are you for real?’“I feel like a bit of a tink turning up to job interviews wearing a tracksuit, T-shirt and trainers — but I would look ridiculous if I was wearing smart clothes and my big white trainers.”David added: “It’s been a total nightmare and very embarrassing. I feel like I have tried everywhere in Scotland but nobody does my size.“And I get people making fun of me when I’m at the bus stop or walking down the street people say ‘Wow. look at him. Are those boats on your feet?’. Others call me ‘banana feet’.It’s demoralising. I think I’d have a job if I had shoes. It brings me down and it’s pretty hurtful.“I just want to get back to work. I can’t be the only person in the UK with size 19 feet.”David, who is 6ft 2in tall and weighs in at 24 stone, has had big feet since he was youngster.When he left school he was a size 16. But he could find shoes that fitted him at the time and worked in retail, cleaning and security jobs through his 20s.But since then his feet have grown three sizes and are almost 12in long and 7in wide. David says he has been turned down by at least ten employers since he last worked.His worried girlfriend Annie Jones, 32, said she hopes he can resolve the situation and land a job.Annie said: “People laugh at him. They point at him and call him names. It’s mean when they call him “clown shoes” and it gets him down.I hope he can get back to work. It would mean a lot to him.”Do you have bigger feet?

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Roberts drove into the back of the car, but no one was injured.Roberts was made to do a breathalyser test, which came back with two different readings.The mum was then tested for alcohol in her blood and the result came back to reveal that she was more than three times the legal limit.Prosecuting, Steve Woodman, said: “On May 28 at around 3.30pm, a Ms Dyson was driving along Pickmere Lane in Cheshire and she came behind a Ford vehicle that was veering across the lanes.“She overtook the Ford car and saw the driver, Laura Roberts, and thought that she looked drunk. As she moved in front of the Ford car, it went into the back of her car.“Ms Dyson got out and spoke to Roberts and called the police. The police came and did a breathalyser test and found her to have two readings - 150mg of alcohol in her breath and 130mg.“As they had two separate readings, they took a sample of blood and they got a reading of 266mg in 100ml of blood - which is well over three times the limit.“In an interview, she said she had been drinking. She had been at a festival with her children and the previous day she had been drinking toffee flavoured vodka.“She said she then woke up in the morning and had a glass of wine. She then left the festival at two in the afternoon.“After the accident, she said that she was beginning to feel the wine that she had earlier that day. Her children were in the car at the time.”Defending, Maria Brannon, said: “She is of good character, with no previous convictions, and has been driving for 19 years with no endorsements.“She has two daughters who are two and four years of age, and she is well regarded in her job working in administration at Wigan Council.“She was at the Geronimo Festival in Cheshire with her children and her and her friend had been camping there and they didn’t drive home until after lunch.“A combination of the alcohol from the night before and the sunburn made her feel ill when she was driving home.“Ms Roberts is aware that she is going to be disqualified from driving today.“Ms Roberts is very ashamed of what happened. Since her husband left her 20 months ago, she has been the sole, primary carer of her children and has been working very hard.“This incident was completely out of character for her and it is highly unlikely that she will commit an offence like this again.“This was a special treat for her children after the difficult 18 months they had since her husband left.She went with her two children and another family to the festival at Arley Hall.“She said that she felt tired just before she drove home but put it down to sunburn. So, she decided to drive - a decision that she bitterly regrets.“She took a wrong turn and got lost down a country lane and this was where the accident happened.“A woman had driven in front of her and Ms Roberts had not seen her until it was too late.She was very apologetic to the woman and the police and there was no damage caused to the car.“Ms Roberts bitterly regrets her decision to drive with the children in the back of her car. However, it must be said that there are no social services involved in the matter and it’s not in dispute that she has been an excellent mother in difficult circumstances.“She is distraught that she put her own children and future at risk.“But there are mitigating factors. First of all, the immediate guilty plea secondly her lack of previous convictions, and also her exemplary character. She is the sole primary career of her two young children.”Roberts was given a 12 months community order and will have to do 100 hours of unpaid work.She was also banned from driving for 2 years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/parliament-crash-71.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"westminster car witnesses cyclists","story":"Barry Williams told the Victoria Derbyshire show he saw cyclists knocked to the ground as a silver vehicle careered into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament.The BBC worker said: I saw a silver car heading towards cyclists on the wrong side of the road.

And then accelerated and hit it at quite high speed“It hit with quite a thud. The car actually came off the ground and landed again.“He hit about five cyclists. One actually got up and began to chase the car.This is what we know so far...“It was frightening. The police were very fast - they vaulted over the barrier followed by armed police.”The driver, in his 20s, was arrested on suspicion of terrorist offences and led away in handcuffs before cops confirmed the Mets Counter-Terrorism Command is now leading the investigation.Witnesses told of horror scenes as the car driving up to 50mph crashed outside Parliament just after 7.30am.Eyewitness Jason Williams said: Someone driving towards Parliament at speed, it wasnt a minor accident, it wasnt a road traffic incident.It was, in my opinion, something planned and something very sinister.Another witness Ewalina Ochab added: I think it looked intentional - the car drove at speed and towards the barriers.I was walking on the other side (of the road). I heard some noise and someone screamed.A chilling video showed cyclists sprawled injured in the street moments after the car smashed into barriers.One woman suffered serious, but non-life threatening, injuries while two other men also needed medical treatment.Met Police confirmed the suspect - who is not believed to have been armed - is currently being quizzed on suspicion of terror offences at a South London police station.But cops said he is not cooperating.Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said in a police press conference that officers were now working to establish the motive behind the attack.He said: It appears to be a deliberate act. We are treating it as a terrorist incident.A COBRA meeting is due to take place at 2pm to discuss this mornings suspected terrorist incident.Dramatic footage after the crash shows heavily-armed police pointing rifles inside a silver car after it crashed into black barriers.A London Ambulance spokesman said two people were taken to hospital and one was treated at the scene - with none thought to have life-threatening injuries.Mr Williams later told ITVs Good Morning Britain that the incident was very, very scary.He said: I’ve seen a man driving a vehicle, and hes gone into one of the bollards. There was a loud bang.Straight away I thought Oh no, this is another terrorist attack. So I’ve just started to run and the police were saying get out, get out of the area.The incident comes just over a year after terrorist Khalid Masood drove into pedestrians and rammed the gates of Parliament in a terror attack.The jihadi killed five people including Westminster cop PC Keith Palmer before he was shot dead by armed police.Streets around Parliament Square, Millbank and Victoria Tower Gardens have been cordoned off with dozens of police, ambulances and firefighters at the scene.While Westminster Bridge has been closed to cars and pedestrians and nearby Lambeth Bridge is also to be shut imminently."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426584353.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"americas vj day celebrations victory japan colourised photos","story":"Among the vivid colour images is one showing a delighted woman using paper as a makeshift megaphone to announce the victory to people on the street on VJ Day.Another image shows two women holding up newspapers, one from the day war started and the other declaring peace.Other photos show the joy felt by sailors and DC residents as they danced the conga in Washington.Stunning shots show US soldier holding Japanese flags in celebration, raising the American flag in Okinawa as well as the iconic photo of a sailor kissing a woman in Times Square, New York.Additional images from WW2 itself have been shown, including the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack by Japan on the US Fleet, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb by the US against Japan in 1945 – the moment which led to the surrender by Japan and effectively brought World War 2 to a close.The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised by electrician Royston Leonard from Cardiff, Wales.The 53-year-old said: “As time goes by I find I am doing more World War Two pictures and giving them a bit of colour helps the younger generation to connect and not just see them as something that happened long ago.“The pictures show that community is all that matters, not buildings or material things.“Their message is that the more people try to destroy us, the more we will smile and carry on.”Victory over Japan Day is the day when Imperial Japan surrendered in World War Two, bringing the Second World War to an end.The term applies both to the day on which the initial announcement of Japan’s surrender was made – August 15th 1945 – and when the signing of the surrender document occurred – September 2nd 1945.VJ Day is commemorated on August 15th in the UK, while the US remember it on September 2nd.The name V-J Day was selected by the Allies after they named V-E Day for the victory in Europe.Mr Royston says that his passion for colourisation has helped him improve his photography skills.He said: “I have learnt so much from colourising, I feel it has helped my photography along the way.“The message is already there for all to see in the pictures themselves but I do feel that colourisation helps the younger generation to understand that what happened was real.“I love giving more life to the pictures and I think that colour improves the story that the photographs tell.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000367052549.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"staggering 330000 more brits are in work than a year ago as record numbers of east europeans go home","story":"The Office for National Statistics revealed employment rose by 42,000 to 32.39 million in the three months to June.And over the past year, there has been a ‘net’ increase of 332,000 in UK nationals in work, and an 86,000 drop in the number of EU citizens – the largest fall since comparable records began in 1997.The fall was led by Poles heading back to the Continent.The number of Romanians and Bulgarians with a job in Britain leapt by 54,000 to 391,000 – equivalent to a city the size of Leicester.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said today’s figures showed a “vibrant jobs market benefitting people across the board”.The minister added: Record rates of ethnic minority people in work also show that more families across our society are benefiting from the security of a job, with wages also on the increase.We have some of the most creative, innovative and hard-working young people in the world and this summer Ive been urging them to take on a summer job, gaining soft skills - or as I call them, essential skills - for their future careers.Meanwhile the unemployment rate fell to the lowest levels for 43 years – 4 per cent – despite the doom and gloom about the slowing economy.But experts warned the jobs growth was showing signs of “petering out”.

I could not believe what I was seeing.I am absolutely convinced it is blood stains from a period. As a woman, you know these things when you see them.Someone has obviously ordered the dress and tried it on without wearing underwear or a pad before sending it back.Who would do something like that?

The good news is that spending quality time with the ones you love doesn’t have to be expensive. Here are some suggestions for activities the family will love without costing the Earth… 1. Pimp an old bike A bike ride is a fantastic way to spend time with the kids, and it can be combined with a low-cost picnic for an even nicer day. Anyone with small people in their lives will vouch for the fact that they don’t stay small for long. The advantage? They quickly outgrow their bikes, meaning there’s likely to be plenty of friends and family with once-loved models gathering dust in the garage or shed.  If your child doesn’t have a bike, speak to friends, neighbours – or check out Freecycle . Once you’ve got your hands on some pre-loved wheels, take your bike to Halfords for a Free Bike Check . In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. If they spot anything that needs attention, they can fix it too. If you\u0027d prefer to go new than second hand, Halfords currently has a range of kids\u0027 bikes at up to 30% off - like the BMX-style Apollo Ace Kids\u0027 Bike, \u0026pound63 (save \u0026pound27), which is suitable for ages three to 11 - depending on the model.  2. Get them growing   Kids love getting their hands dirty – and if you have a garden or access to an allotment then you can join forces to tackle the weeds and grow some wonderful flowers, fruit and vegetables. Reward the littl’un who pulls up the most weeds, hold a sunflower growing competition, or see who can coax the biggest marrow from the soil. You can encourage kids to help by letting them choose their own plants: fruits like strawberries and tomatoes are also fun and reasonably simple to grow – they also have a tasty reward at the end! 3. Make some real lemonade  Making real lemonade is simple to do, inexpensive and unbeatable on a warm day. Gather some lemons, sugar and water (you’ll need roughly 140g of caster sugar and 1 litre of water for every three lemons).  Once it\u0027s ready, enjoy in the shade of the Halfords 250 Fully Waterproof Gazebo, \u0026pound39 (save \u0026pound11) - perfect for covering a lemonade stand or an outdoor play area. 4. Go hunting for bats   Bats are glorious creatures, and the summer months are a good time to get out and spot them. As the sun sets you can usually spot these flying mammals darting about in the sky. Their erratic flight patterns mean they\u0027re easy to distinguish from birds, and keeping an eye out for them is a great way to spend an evening. You can also head to your local park with an evening picnic – use the Halfords Coolbag Trolley , \u0026pound15 (half price), to get your food there with minimal carrying effort. As it gets dark, lie back on a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket,\u0026pound10 (half price), and spot the sonar-equipped mosquito-munchers in action.  Or, if you\u0027re looking to go further afield, why not take the Urban Escape 6 Person Vis A Vis Tent along and make it an overnight trip. It\u0027s currently half price at just \u0026pound125. Take some facts about bats with you too, so the little ones will learn about one of nature\u0027s most misunderstood creatures. For example, bats can – apparently – consume up to 1,200 mosquitos per hour and will sometimes eat their own bodyweight in insects in a single night. You\u0027ll find loads of information and details about organised Bat Walks on the Bat Conservation Trust\u0027s website. 5. Get them stargazing Those summer nights are ideal for checking out the cosmos. The lack of clouds means uninterrupted views of the universe and the hot weather means you\u0027ll get a nice warm evening to gaze into space. You don\u0027t need special equipment for basic stargazing. Apps for your phone will tell you what\u0027s visible, and guide you to interesting stars and planets, as well as giving you the names of constellations. The Moon often looks stunning, and it\u0027s also possible to spot Jupiter and Saturn in the night sky using the naked eye. If you have a decent pair of binoculars you can also spot nebulae and get a great view of our solar system. The Moon, in particular, is a great thing to examine with binoculars.  An Urban Escape King Size Moon Chair , \u0026pound30 (half price), is the perfect spot (with the perfect name) for checking out the cosmos. If you get the bug, check out your local stargazing club. Often you\u0027d be expected to take your own telescope but many would be thrilled to let you experience the night sky through their equipment – check the internet and don\u0027t be afraid to fire off an email. 6. Watch a movie in the moonlight   Across the country there are multiple places to catch a movie in the great outdoors. Search hard enough and you might even find free outdoor movies near you. Taking in a movie on the big screen outdoors can be a great way to spend time with the family. Pack yourselves a nice supper in the Summerhouse Seville 4 Person Wicker Picnic Basket, \u0026pound69.99 - and don’t forget to include the popcorn! 7. Take a low-cost road trip "},{"url":null,"title":"foreign secretary jeremy hunt says","story":"NewsForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says Jeremy Corbyn would have \u0027no moral authority\u0027 to condemn terrorist attacks as Prime MinisterHis comments have ratcheted up the pressure on the Labour leader in the ongoing anti-Semitism rowShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent13:54, 14 AUG 2018Updated14:03, 14 AUG 2018News (Image: PA)Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Foreign Secretary has said Jeremy Corbyn would have no moral authority to condemn terrorist attacks on British citizens if he ever became prime minister. Jeremy Hunt\u0027s deeply damaging comments have ratcheted up the pressure on the Labour leader in the ongoing anti-Semitism row. Mr Corbyn came under attack from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after it emerged that he attended a ceremony where a wreath was was laid in memory of Palestinians suspected of being behind the Munich Olympics massacre. The Labour leader has acknowledged he was present at the event at the Palestinian Martyrs Cemetery in Tunisia in 2014, but said he did not think he was involved in the wreath-laying.  Supporters insisted he had made clear his abhorrence for the I972 Munich attack, when 11 Israeli athletes were killed, and that he condemned all terrorist acts.  Writing on Twitter , Mr Hunt said: If Jeremy Corbyn thinks terrorism is justified for the causes he believes in, how would he as prime minister have the moral authority to condemn terrorist murders of British citizens? Unbelievable and shocking.   Benjamin Netanyahu slams Jeremy Corbyn over claims he laid wreath at terrorists\u0027 graves  The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Marie van der Zyl, poured scorn on Mr Corbyn\u0027s claim his that he was not involved in the wreath-laying.  She said he needed to understand he could not cavort with terrorists. After days of being evasive, Jeremy Corbyn has now admitted attending a memorial event for the terrorist murders of unarmed athletes. How can you say he is not involved? she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. In 1972, these are unarmed people who were attending the Olympics, they were savagely mutilated and murdered. There is no reason Jeremy Corbyn should not apologise to the widows and to the victims for this terrible massacre. He needs to also recognise that he can\u0027t cavort with terrorists. The row originally erupted after the Daily Mail published pictures of Mr Corbyn holding a wreath in the cemetery, which it said were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of the Black September terror group.  Labour said he had attended the event to remember victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) offices in Tunis. However, in a highly unusual intervention, he was accused by Mr Netanyahu of laying a wreath at the grave of one of the terrorists responsible for the Munich attack.  The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone - left, right and everything in between, he wrote on Twitter.  However, Mr Corbyn hit back, saying the Israeli leader\u0027s claims were false.

The fragrant wife of convicted perjurer and former Tory deputy chairman Sir Jeffrey is still beloved, three decades later, for bringing a cup of tea to the press pack gathered outside their Cambridgeshire vicarage during one of her husband\u0027s many scandals. That someone hounded and pursued by the forces of Fleet Street should be so hospitable was considered remarkable, even heroic. It bought her considerable goodwill, not just because a small village in Cambridgeshire is bereft of places to buy tea but also because, when on a job miles from anywhere, bored and stood outside in all weathers, it is a civilising pleasure to drink from china rather than Styrofoam. It humanises those on all sides - if hunter and hunted both drink tea, they think the other can\u0027t be all bad. It is a moment of peace and acknowledgement of the other\u0027s tribulations, like Christmas Day football between enemies in World War One. It doesn\u0027t end the war, but it\u0027s a nice thought.  In 2007, footballer Teddy Sheringham performed the same feat when his then-girlfriend Danielle Lloyd was in the Celebrity Big Brother house and embroiled in a race row with Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty.  Only he did it half-naked.   And so it was that this weekend former Foreign Secretary and habitual-utterer-of-nasty-things Boris Johnson \u0027did a Mary\u0027, as it is known by some, and produced a tray of tea for the photographers gathered outside his country home in Oxfordshire.  There is a lot that can be gleaned from a person\u0027s tea habits, and even more from a tray produced for others. While gazing enviously at Teddy\u0027s abdomen, you will I am sure have noticed he carried a set of matching mugs, minimalist aluminium sugar caddy, and a 2-pint bottle of semi-skimmed milk, on a pleasingly biscuit-coloured wooden tray. All very stripped-down and simple. You get the impression this is a man who does not like mess, and treats strangers with the same high standards he expects in his own life. Two pints tells you he lives alone, and frugally. The tray says his kitchen is pristine, and his fingernails clean.  I\u0027m not sure what Mary\u0027s tea tray looked like - but there are rumours it involved proper cups with saucers. AND BISCUITS.  Boris did not do that. In fact, Boris could not have made more of a cock-up of it if he tried.  The tray contains a hotch-potch of thick clay mugs. One came free with an Easter egg. One looks like it usually has toothbrushes in it. Another bears a corporate logo, and one appears to be from a Battersea Power Station sponsorship programme.  They are, in short, the mugs you make the staff drink from. Mugs that don\u0027t matter.  And no sugar bowl for the snappers. No. A half-open packet of granulated, no doubt with a used spoon wedged in it.  This is a tray that screams YOU\u0027RE ALL PEASANTS, NOW SAY THANK YOU.   And bear in mind, this is the fellow\u0027s second home. He\u0027s a multi-millionaire. There\u0027s bound to be nice mugs and a milk jug in that farmhouse somewhere, he just hasn\u0027t bothered to produce them. The milk is truly boggling. The man has four children and a wife. The children are grown up, but even if they weren\u0027t at home there\u0027s a minimum of two adults there for the whole weekend, and possibly friends and political advisers visiting. A single pint of milk wouldn\u0027t last an afternoon, so anyone sane would buy a 4-pinter on the trip down from London. Which leads me to the uncomfortable conclusion that Boris is either so stupid he bought several, more expensive 1-pint bottles, or that he keeps an old 1-pinter to use as a milk jug. And that\u0027s just skanky.  He is the antithesis of Teddy Sheringham. This is a tea boy who leaves you wondering whether the mugs were washed first, and what in. His fingernails, were they to be inspected, would almost certainly contain traces of the past week\u0027s bogeys. Boris did admirably in refusing to answer questions, and declaring himself on a humanitarian mission because you have been here all day and you\u0027ve been incredibly patient. But if the purpose of his jaunt down the garden path was to buy goodwill, it failed for three simple reasons.  The first is that tea is fundamentally about good manners. The same rituals and purpose apply whether in a Japanese tea ceremony or a truckers\u0027 roadside caff. Boris\u0027 tray displays an impolite lack of consideration, and would be looked at aghast were he to offer such a thing at an official reception, to his in-laws, or to Theresa May.  But seeing as Boris is in his current disciplinary hate-crime pickle because he likened veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, manners are presumably something he lacks on a grand scale.  The second is that, if this tray is really the best he could muster, he must surely have seen that it needed adornment of some kind. Half a packet of Digestives, perhaps, or a handful of Penguins. Anything. Instead, it\u0027s as graceless as his writing. And third is the basic rule that anyone volunteering for a tea run is usually doing it to be nice - to repay an earlier run done by a colleague, to suck up to someone, or to apologise for past wrongs.  In Boris\u0027 case, he\u0027s doing it to pretend to be nice. A bit like when he and Gideon Osborne sat down with some Transport for London workers in hi-vis jackets, and tried for a photo that didn\u0027t make them look like Buller boys talking to daddy\u0027s horse valet.   In short, the best that Boris could do, when caught in a jam of his own making and confronted by journalists, was to attempt deflection with a half-hearted tea round that did little more than belittle the people he delivered it to. The proof is in the pudding with these things, and those journalists will no sooner give him an easier ride tomorrow than he will deliver them a tea pot and the family china.  Not just because since Boris\u0027 column last week there has been an increase in reported hate incidents against women wearing a face veil, but because journalists know and loathe Boris of old.  He\u0027s been fired for making up quotes from his own godfather, promised to use journalistic means to track down the address of someone a mate wanted beaten up, and has not only used his pen to foment racism but boasted of the \u0026pound250,000 he is reportedly paid for doing it.

The pensioner, who suffers from mobility issues, says her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. Retired care assistant Freda said: The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude. One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?  Freda had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says the travel operator Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda, who lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish.  My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.  She said there were no reps on the holiday who they could complain to about the trip - so instead Ms Jackson submitted a letter of complaint to Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook bosses initially offered Freda and her friend a \u0026pound75 holiday voucher as compensation for the \u0027disappointing\u0027 trip abroad. But after declining the initial \u0027goodwill gesture\u0027 made by the travel company, they made an improved offer of \u0026pound566 to be split between Freda and her friend.

Sion Monty, 30, who owns a gym, was mortified to discover he had hit 16 stone in just six months.  But with his business reputation on the line and wanting to ensure he was a healthy parent to his son Tedi, he ditched the weight with the help of his new tot.  Sion, who also has his own gym clothing line and supplement range vowed to lose weight after he hit 16 stone by doing daily runs, hill sprints and long walks with Tedi in his pram.   \u2028But thanks to a diet overhaul and exercising six days-a-week, he lost nearly four stone, buffed up and got super fit for his little lad and proud partner Kara Williams, 27.  \u2028Now body-confident Sion - who used to refuse to take off his jumper in the gym - is competing in competitions and inspiring other \u0027dad bods\u0027 on social media. \u2028Sion, from Porthmadog, Wales, said: I didn\u0027t want to be a fat dad. I looked in the mirror and realised that if I wanted to live a long life and see my son live his life I needed to change. \u2028I was so body conscious and maybe a bit embarrassed because I was known as a fit guy. \u2028I knew I had to involve Tedi in getting fit if I was going to fit it in, while spending time with him. \u2028You should have seen how much he laughed at his dad jogging up the hills. \u2028He loves birds, so I would choose walks and runs where he there were lots of birds for us to spot together. \u2028My exercise had dropped off because I just didn\u0027t have time to spent that time away from the family. But the key was involving them in it.

Social media star Kate Ovens, famed for her massive appetite, ploughed her way through a giant lamb and chicken kebab - a dish dubbed \u0027London\u0027s biggest kebab.\u0027 The 24-year-old demolished the 3kg \u0027sandwich,\u0027 despite it containing an estimated 8,000 calories. The massive kebab was eight times bigger than normal and contained four times the recommended daily intake for a woman.  Courageous chewer Kate, who runs the successful Kate\u0027s Food Challenges Facebook page, took just under an hour to munch her way through the massive lamb and chicken doner kebab - because she needed to keep taking breaks.   The 5ft 5ins foodie said: I reckon I was eating for about 45 minutes, but I did need to keep taking breaks before the end. It\u0027s unusual to have such nice bread with a kebab and it was really doughy and fluffy. At first it was incredible - I loved getting served a kebab the size of a pillow. But towards the end, I would have preferred my bed - it was very tiring. Kate, from Kennington, south London, was invited to try the massive kebab - which stood more than 6 inches tall and measured more than 18 inches long - at the new Fulham branch of German Doner Kebab, in south west London. She said: The kebab was absolutely lovely, but the bread blanket was almost the end of me. It was thick and doughy, and there was so much of it.  But the only reason I reckon I could finish it is because it was of such great, premium quality. Every bite was fantastic - it\u0027s just that there were a lot of bites. Kate\u0027s hefty kebab contained lamb and chicken as well as her five-a-day portions of salad and tomatoes and lashings of garlic mayo. What makes her mammoth eating feat even more remarkable is that it was her first challenge in more than two months - and she didn\u0027t do any training. To give her the best chance of success, die-hard Cottager Kate wore her lucky 2010 Fulham FC shirt - which she wore when her beloved team won the playoffs at Wembley last season. She added: I asked them not to put chilli sauce in it, because I\u0027m a wimp.

Samantha Crosby, 24 and Maxie Mills, 60, from Washington, US, have said that they want to have a baby so that Maxie can live on after he \u0027dies of old age\u0027. Despite often being confused as Samantha\u0027s grandfather and having a child nearly twice her age, Maxie is prepared to be the father of her child. The couple got together after meeting at a concert where Maxie was performing.  Samantha wasn\u0027t put off by Maxie\u0027s age and tracked him down on Facebook .  Initially, Maxie wasn\u0027t interested in Samantha, but bowled over by his musical talent, Samantha wouldn\u0027t let him go after she felt it was \u0027love at first sight\u0027.  Samantha, who is a cosmetology student, has said she wants her own baby with Maxie for \u0027sentimental reasons\u0027, saying: I would like to one day have children, I have known for a long time that I want children, but now being with someone much older than me it is sort of more of a sentimental reason, I would like to have children with Maxie because after he passes away I would still have a piece of him. When out and about together, people often mistake Samantha for Maxie\u0027s daughter and when the couple explain they are romantically linked, they receive odd looks but say that their connection goes beyond age. Maxie has two children, a 40-year-old daughter and 35-year-old son from his previous marriages who don\u0027t yet know about their relationship. Samantha said: I started spending a lot of time with my mother. She enjoys going to wineries around town and listening to live music. One night I went with her to watch a friend of hers who plays in a group at a local winery, from there I quickly made friends with all the gentlemen in the band they are all in their fifties and sixties.   One of the band members had shoulder surgery, so he couldn\u0027t play guitar. Maxie filled in for him one night at a bar, my friend Kevin had told me that I would like Maxie, that he was a good guy and like him but with a southern accent. After I heard Maxie play my favourite Fleetwood Mac song, I instantly knew I wanted to get to know him. I tried making small talk with him at the bar after he finished playing, but he wasn\u0027t that interested. Later I added him on Facebook, initiated contact, and he was taken aback by it. We slowly started going out on dates. For me yes it was love at first sight, there was something more about him other than his Texan accent that I liked and wanted to get to know. For him I know it was different, he had a hard time coming to terms with my age and our relationship, he has stated to me before that it was my kindness to him that made him choose to give me a chance. I was attracted to him initially from his confidence and looks, once I got to know him, he was a better person than anyone else I had ever met. He was and has continuously been charming, kind, romantic and caring.  Our age gap is 36 years. It hasn\u0027t really caused much of a problem for us right now. I just moved in with Maxie a few weeks ago. I know that in the beginning his friends were hesitant about our relationship, suggesting that I was a gold digger. But since he is a school teacher, not the highest paid occupation, it became apparent that money was not what I was after. Other than that we both have a hard time dealing with outside people. By that I mean when we go out in public and we refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend and they give us odd looks, or for example we were out at a restaurant for dinner and the chef asked if I was his daughter, and Maxie simply replied back that no his daughter was much older than me. I have hard time with the fact that in my eyes he is my boyfriend, my partner and lover, and that everyone else sees our relationship as weird or odd. I have always dated people older than myself so it has never been out of character for me.    Samantha\u0027s family are very supportive of her relationship with Maxie, despite her mum being initially unsure, but after seeing how happy he makes her daughter is fully accepting of the couple.  I have had several people say that me dating him is gross. At the beginning my mother said that she thought me dating someone 36 years older than me was weird and I told her that that was fine she didn\u0027t have to think it was normal. Beyond that the usual is people assuming that I am his daughter. As I said he is a musician and he plays all over town so I get a lot of people that make comments when I go to see him. Some people apologise and other simply say \u0027oh\u0027. I will say among his friends there are people who have taken to me easier than others.

Cabin crew said the woman was out of control after drinking too much in the duty free bar at Moscow before boarding the flight, and they had to restrain her shortly after take off.

The wooden Dormition orthodox church on the shore of Lake Onega was erected in 1774 by Catherine the Great - and burned down in a raging inferno last week. Schoolboy Ignat Sharapov, 15 - whose social media is full of Satanist signs and images - has told police he set fire to the structure by using five litres of petrol to ignite its dry timber. An expert said it will cost \u0026pound1 million to reconstruct the 138 ft church - as tall as a 12 storey building - at Kondopoga in Karelia republic in northern Russia. A law enforcement source said: “He classifies himself as a Satanist. Allegedly he just did not like the church.”  A witness said: He was a Satanist, dressed in black. And when he was detained by police, he laughed.” Over breakfast the teenager had told his relatives he was going to destroy the church which had stood beside Lake Onega for 244 years, but they thought he was joking. He asked his grandmother to wrap up some homemade biscuits for him to give to his friend, who he later met and read something on his tablet computer. “His expression changed - he got up and said: ‘I’m going to burn down the church\u0027,” his friend said. He doused the church in petrol then set fire to it. The church caretaker said: “He took with him five litres of gasoline, and walked along the lake.  The dry timber caught like a candle.” More than 20 firefighters with six appliances rushed to the scene of the famous church but were unable to extinguish the flames which destroyed the bell tower in a few minutes and the entire structure in two hours. The boy then fled the scene and was apprehended after his grandmother called the emergency services to report the fire. He has been held by police in detention pending further investigations into a criminal case involving arson. Sharapov’s social media contained a picture of a burning church before the attack on the historic 18th century building, along with many satanic images. State-run TV named the boy citing law enforcement sources and showed his satanic ‘temple’ in a disused poultry farm building daubed in devil-worshipping signs and slogans.

building.“Luca is the more inquisitive one.“Connell is more playful – he’s just excited to see friends.“I don’t think he quite knows what he is going into.“I think he is ready for it.“He just seems to

again and you saw there were a lot of our fans at the game and they celebrated also.“The fans made the noise against Dunfermline that it wasn’t good enough and we heard that.“I said after that Dundee United can play better football and our fans deserved more spirit, more fighting spirit and better results.“That pressure is always there if you have the jersey of Dundee United, if you are the manager of Dundee United, work for Dundee United you are the biggest club in the Championship and everybody wants to beat you.“People think it is easy to win a game, it is not easy – you have to respect the opponent, you have to know in this league it is not always nice football, it is more fighting and desire.“You could see Queen of the South didn’t give up, in the second half they put I

striker Sam Jones to his attack.Speaking yesterday, Neil said: “Sam Jones is one we have looked at, one of a few but I don’t want to be disrespectful to Shrewsbury by commenting too much on it.“We have looked at him. We have asked the question and spoken to the club and I believe there is an agreement there but there is nothing agreed with him yet.”Ayr striker Shankland, who has started the season in scintillating form with nine goals in five games, has been linked with a move to Dundee in recent weeks.It was reported on Thursday that the newly-promoted Championship club had rejected a bid from an English side for their striker, but McCann, who has made it clear he is keen to add to his attacking options, played down his interest.“It’s really unfair to comment on any players I am after,” he said. “What I would say is that I have been in the market and been actively trying to get players.“Some have come close and fallen through, others not.“Lawrence is a very talented player.“I know him from my time at Dunfermline and have no doubt he could come to a club like Dundee and do very well, especially in the Premiership.“But as it stands there is nothing happening.”He added: “We tried to do some business on Thursday, it didn’t quite happen but we will continue working on that.”Dundee \u0026#8216agree deal\u0026#8217 for English attacker\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann on leeds united target steven caulker i thought we would lose him","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann was left relieved after managing to hold on to a couple of key players as the English transfer window shut on Thursday afternoon.Glen Kamara and Steven Caulker were both linked with a move down south \u0026#8211 with Leeds rumoured to be interested in the latter \u0026#8211 but remain with Dundee, and McCann says there were never any offers despite the reported interest.“There have been no official bids put on the table yet for Steven,” he said. “Clearly he is a player that attracts a lot of interest.“The good thing is, I thought he would probably go and we would lose him, but we still have him.“We need to be thankful for the squad we have just now, because we could have lost a few players to down south.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil rues missed chances in defeat by aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has admitted a failure to even go close with clear-cut chances cost Dundee dearly as they went down narrowly to Aberdeen on Saturday.The Dark Blues lost out to a late Gary Mackay-Steven penalty at Dens Park and, while he had no complaints about the decision, Neil was left frustrated as he saw three clear-cut opportunities squandered at the other end.Twice Sofien Moussa blasted the ball well over when given a sight of goal, while strike partner Jean Mendy fired wide.And if the other areas of their game earned praised from the manager, he knows misses like that have cost the team dearly in two defeats so far.That’s why he’s looking to add another striker to his squad and Shrewsbury front man Sam Jones watched the game from the main stand.A five-figure deal has been agreed with the Shrews and the 26-year-old will be signed up this week if he can agree personal terms.Addressing those misses first, Neil admits his front two should have done better.“When you create three, I would call them 100% chances through on goal, and you don’t work the goalkeeper once, that’s where you fall down,” he said. “It’s sore because outside the chances they don’t take, I think the forward work was exceptional. Moussa got absolutely battered at times but his hold up play was great. Mendy worked his socks off up there.“But you have to work the keeper and they know that. It’s not that I’m having a go at them, they understand that.“I do think we need help in that department. There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work. The guys just need to slow down, the most important thing they need to do is make the keeper make a save.”As for the goal that won the game, Neil conceded after initial doubts he agreed Bobby Madden’s call to award a penalty against Genseric Kusunga for handling a Niall McGinn corner was correct.“Just to address the penalty, I’ve seen it, it’s a penalty,” he added.“At the time I wasn’t sure. I went to Bobby to get his opinion on it at the end of the game and regardless of how close Gensi is, he felt it was a penalty. I’ve seen it now and I agree, his hand’s up there.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b715b32e13b1-e1534164160703.jpg ","title":"dundee football club pulls out of all fixtures a month away from 50th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee football club that was scheduled to celebrate its 50th anniversary next month has been mothballed.Logie Harp AFC, formed in 1968, has had to take the decision to withdraw from the Midlands Amateur Football League for the forthcoming season.Secretary Davie Anderson (pictured), 54, said a combination of events – including weekend work commitments for players – had forced the team to kick the season into touch.A decision was taken to call full-time on the anniversary event at the Invercarse Hotel, despite the club signing TV personality Tam Cowan as guest speaker.Davie, who has been involved with Harp for more than 30 years, said: “It is sad that the club got to this point.“There have been a number of clubs that have fallen into this situation, including NCR and Riverside Athletic.“People’s lifestyles are different from what they use to be, whether its down to work commitments, family or other obligations.“We had a backlog of fixtures coming up to the end of last season, including midweek games, which added to the struggle.“We had to cancel a few fixtures as the injuries and lack of bodies started to pile up.“We had the AGM earlier this month and a number of players were unable to commit.“The decision was made to withdraw.

three weeks ago and missed the Betfred Cup games against Peterhead and Brechin.He was expected to be fit for the Premiership opener at St Mirren last weekend but suffered a reaction to the injury on the eve of the game in Paisley.It’s unclear yet just how long that will keep the central midfielder out for but he is a big doubt for today’s home clash with the Dons.Despite falling to a 2-1 defeat to the Buddies, the Dark Blues midfield didn’t miss Kamara’s presence too much with Lewis Spence an able deputy with Kharl Madianga, Elton Ngwatala and Paul McGowan ahead of him also performing well.And those four are expected to continue today from the start.Meanwhile, the English transfer window shutting yesterday evening was good news for Dundee fans with Kamara and Steven Caulker still

be unlikely to accept a loan-to-buy deal with the 22-year-old’s contract expiring at the end of the season.Both Celtic and Rangers had been credited with interest in the midfielder and they have till

defeat that saw three goals conceded in the second half against Dunfermline last week, his desire to make changes is obvious.However, a number of factors, not least fitness, will come into play before he finalises his line-up.Stewart Murdoch could return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any reaction to the knock that’s sidelined him since last month’s defeat at Ross County, full-back Callum Booth will also return to the squad.After almost

the pair are involved.Whoever he decides, or is able to use, Csaba will be looking for much better this time round.While injuries have ruled out various key players in the games so far, he believes those taking their places should be doing so with the aim of hanging on to them even if everyone is fit.“I have said to the team you cannot wait for Fraser Fyvie or Stewart Murdoch or Callum Booth or

Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\u0026#8220The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\u0026#8220Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\u0026#8220It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\u0026#8220The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure.\u0026#8220The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\u0026#8220All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\u0026#8220The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.\u0026#8221Damian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly.\u0026#8220Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\u0026#8220The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”Stephanie Pollitt, assistant director of real estate policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal.\u0026#8220Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account.\u0026#8220Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”The latest restructuring would come on top of a store closure programme the retailer has been carrying out since February.A total of 16 Homebase stores have been shut this year and the business has also axed 303 jobs at its head office in Milton Keynes.Homebase could see some resistance from landlords to the CVA, with the property industry expressing disdain for the procedure, saying it leaves them out-of-pocket.CVAs have been adopted by a host of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare.The Homebase store closures follow the sale of the business earlier this year by its former Australian owner Wesfarmers to Hilco, a retail turnaround specialist, for £1.Homebase was bought by Wesfarmers for £340 million in 2016.Wesfarmers is known for its Bunnings chain in Australia, and attempted to import the home improvement brand to the UK by converting a host of Homebase stores into the Bunnings format.However, the strategy ended in disaster.Prior to the Hilco takeover, Homebase had 250 stores at its peak and 12,000 staff.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/5a34070ebb9ee-e1513361670133.jpg ","title":"wanted disney is hiring staff to sail round the world on its cruise ships and get paid for it","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWant to sail the world with Mickey Mouse and a host of Disney characters \u0026#8211 and get paid for it?Disney Cruise Line is hiring for what is sure to be a dream role for Disney fans everywhere.The voyage will take people around the world on Disney\u0026#8217s massive cruise liners, visiting different countries.Waiters and waitresses will be required to \u0026#8216create an unforgettable voyage for families\u0026#8217 by delivering \u0026#8216exceptional customer service\u0026#8217.However, staff will be required to be flexible for 24/7 working while on the overseas adventure.Those wanting to apply must be aged at least 21.

from Aberdeen University have spent more than eight years painstakingly recovering and preserving everyday objects that indigenous Yup’ik people used – in a race against the clock before melting ice and raging winter storms reclaim the Nunalleq site.Dating back more than four centuries, their finds include wooden ritual masks, ivory tattoo needles, and even a belt of caribou teeth, all preserved in “extraordinary condition”.Now archaeologists and museum staff from the university are working with The Qanirtuuq Native Village Corporation to put the finishing touches to the first exhibition at a new museum which will enable them to be displayed in their place of origin.Aberdeen University project leader Dr Rick Knecht said: “The unique conditions in this arctic region mean artefacts which are more than four centuries old have retained an unbelievable level of detail.“We have uncovered grass baskets and mats made when Shakespeare walked the earth but when we take them out of the ground the grass weaving still retains a trace of its green colour and we have been amazed by the variety and intricacy of the woven patterns.”Once removed from the ground, however, the artefacts begin to deteriorate quickly and it is for this reason that Dr Knecht and his team transported more than 50,000 items to Aberdeen University, where professional conservators oversaw preservation treatment.Dr Knecht said: “When we began the project, it was impossible to conduct conservation work on site, and the items recovered were transported, some still covered in earth, to Aberdeen.“The long-term goal, however, has always been to return them to where they belong and that has become possible with the imminent opening of the new Nunalleq Culture and Archaeology Research Center.”He added: “This is one of the largest collections ever recovered from a single site in Alaska, and perhaps even the whole Arctic region, and is of huge significance as it now accounts for more than 90% of everything we know about pre-contact Yup’ik, one of the major indigenous groups in North America.“We are delighted to be working with the Nunalleq community to ensure these vital artefacts related to their lives can be shared in the place they belong.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cheque it out plans to turn north east bank into gym","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans have been submitted to turn a former north-east bank into

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soaked campbeltown cyclist raised charity cash","story":"\t\tMark DaveyUpdated: 08/08/18, 8:30 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Campbeltown cyclist joined an Argyll peloton for this year’s RideLondon 100 event.The eight-week London heat wave came to an abrupt end just in time for the cycling quartet to take to the roads.Campbeltown’s Marjorie Leighton had enthused so much after taking part last year, that she encouraged three Mid Argyll friend, Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol, to participate in this year’s challenge.The day before the event the air temperature had soared to 32°C and the cyclists prepared for the possibilty of heat exhaustion.However on the day, they were shocked to find that they should have perhaps brought cyling capes instead.The persistent rain combined with the wind ensured that they were all soaked to the skin at the finish.The Argyll cyclists beat the target required for their chosen charity, Bloodwise (formerly Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research) which helps to fund research for specific types of cancer.This charity was selected, due to each of the participants having some experience with cancer.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"avenue arch improvement scheme to be re tendered","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project to improve the condition of Inveraray\u0026#8217s iconic 18th century arches looks to be making progress as bids to carry out the work are invited.But the Dalmally road archway, refurbished around five years ago but never re-painted, will not be part of the contract.This will be the second time the work has been put out to tender by Argyll and Bute Council.Speaking at last month\u0026#8217s annual general meeting of community development company Inspire Inveraray, council regeneration manager Audrey Martin said: \u0026#8216It has already been out to tender, but the bids were too dear.

Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety. The hotel\u0027s current owners, based in Malaysia, have so far failed to act on a Dangerous Building Notice served on the hotel in the Spring.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

The big bird was scoffing the chips close to the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr. A grainy image of the pointless attack has only now emerged. The man is wearing what looks like a white short sleeved shirt, black trousers and white training shoes. He is seen lifting his right leg back and then battering the chip-loving gull. Any kick to a creature like this would have left it in a very painful condition or at worst cause it to die from internal injuries. The chips had already been dropped on the ground close to the junction of Carrick Street and Boswell Park and it is not been regarded as a case where the gull actually stole the grub. Ironically the bird’s attacker was also eating his own portion of takeway food. The grainy image looks to have been taken from mobile phone footage. It appears to be right outside a late night food takeaway. The bird-brained incident took place on Saturday July 28 and only yesterday (Tuesday) was it able to be made public. An undercover inspector from the charity’s special investigations unit has been working on the case. He said: “We are being assisted by Police Scotland in our investigation and we would like to trace the individual involved. “I would urge anyone who recognises him to get in touch. “ Any information given to our animal helpline is treated confidentially and can be given nonymously. “Recently we have been made aware of a number of incidents involving attacks on seagulls and would like to remind the public that gulls, like all other birds, are protected by law. “We’d encourage the public to clear up any rubbish as gulls are attracted to it as they look for food.” Anyone who thinks they know the lout or remember him from that Saturday should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999. Ayr is in the middle of a seagull crisis at the moment with some of them attacking people including a prominent lawyer who had to fight off the attack using a rolled up copy of the Ayrshire Post. He was pecked on the top of his head in Burns Statue Square and the attack drew blood.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPolice Scotland"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13075347.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_020818flushes_05JPG.jpg","title":"mixed support hgv parking plan","story":"NewsMixed support for HGV parking plan in GirvanA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:20, 13 AUG 2018NewsTown centre car park could be used by HGVs for overnight stops (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think. At least that’s the view of four random people the Post spoke to in the town. But they want rules to ensure there aren’t trucks sitting in The Flushes car park 24/7. Ayrshire Roads Alliance are looking at a plan that would allow HGVs to park overnight. And Councillor Alec Clark supports the idea of trucks coming in from 6pm and leaving before 6am next day. But other voices in the town believe this could cause night-time noise for residents at the Hillcrest car home. And they fear excessive diesel fumes in the heart of the town.  Craig Galloway, 54, said: “Having the lorries going to The Flushes would free up the harbour area for cars and buses. And it would maybe stop them parking in the streets.” Mr Galloway added: “I think the lorries do bring a business benefit to the town, in terms of spending in shops and take-aways.” Nat Taylor, 64, thought: “The Flushes car park tends to empty at night, and the lorries are generally away first thing in the morning.” Mr Taylor added: “There’s really nowhere else that’s suitable. Ainslie car park (at the south end of the town) would only take about four HGVs.” Betty McQuiston, 76, has been involved with Girvan’s volunteer attractions committee for many years. She doesn’t want to see the town’s streets clogged up with heavy trucks. But she admitted: “ It’s a Catch 22 situation. We don’t necessarily want trucks overnight in the town - but they have to go somewhere.  “There’s already quite a lot parking in the streets, so having them at The Flushes would be better.” Mrs McQuiston added: “There’s no room at Ainslie car park, and the trucks have ripped up the surface at the harbour car park.” Scott Purdie, 49, believes a truck park could be created at Grangestone Industrial Estate. He said “It’s a big estate, with big areas of ground that could be used for overnight parking of trucks.” Mr Purdie added: “Big lorries don’t help tourism, but I can see the argument that they need somewhere to go. “However, 6pm is not late in the summer, and people in cars are sometimes frightened to park next to them. “I would fear The Flushes turning into a full-time lorry park, unless it’s properly regulated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"resident told how looked horror","story":"NewsResident told how she looked on in horror as drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at back court in Ayrshire streetMan taken away in hospital after alarm raised by concerned residentShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning11:00, 12 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA concerned resident told how she looked on in horror as a drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at a back court in Cumnock. The addict was spotted shooting up behind flats in the town’s Townhead Street. He was taken by ambulance to hospital after a worried neighbour contacted the police. The shocking incident was raised at Cumnock Community Council. Now there are fears that children playing in the back court could get injured if they picked up a discarded needle. One woman said: “There was a boy injecting himself for 20 minutes near trees at a back court. “There were needles lying about.” A police officer attended the community council meeting to give residents a report of crimes that had taken place in the past month. She vowed to take the matter up with the police inspector and urged residents with any concerns about drug abuse to contact police on 101. She added new community policing teams would be introduced across East Ayrshire in September and that more community officers would be seen out on the beat. She told the meeting that police had received 49 crime reports in Cumnock for the past month and 28 of them were detected. The majority of these crimes were theft by shoplifting and occurred at the town’s ASDA, according to the officer. She pointed out there had been a spate of opportunist house break-ins in the town but not in one particular street. One robbery and serious assault had taken place in Wylie Crescent and that had been detected, the officer added. Other crimes included breach of the peace and common assaults. Bob McCulloch, the council’s acting head of housing and communities, said: “Finding a discarded needle or syringe is undoubtedly worrying for members of the public. It is essential that such items are disposed of properly and safely to protect individuals and the wider community. “If needles or syringes are found in public areas, including roads, pavements, parks or public buildings, then individuals should phone 01563 554061 during working hours or 0345 724 0000 out with working hours.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre. Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

And this little beauty is the same age as Girvan owner Robert ‘Rab’ Smith. Retired bricklayer Rab is 62 and his Austin dates from 1956. “It’s quite a cute wee thing for its age,” said Rab of the British classic. The cars cost a mere \u0026pound507 when first launched in 1952. That was \u0026pound62 cheaper than main rival, the Morris Minor. Rab, who was also a retained firefighter for 26 years, loves a vintage car.  And he had a 1959 Austin A35, before acquiring the A30. The first owner of the new A30 in 1956 was James McCleary of Minnigaff, near Newton Stewart. Mr McCleary ran the car for years before it came into Ayrshire ownership in 1973 with first Frank Webster, then farmer Stanley Gray of Craigmalloch, Barr. Mr Gray also ran it for years, but by 1988 it was in total disrepair - and being used as a chicken coop. It was at this point that Hugh Sloan of Colmonell village came along to rescue the car. Mr Sloan took it to his workshop in Colmonell’s Main Street. And, in a labour of love, he performed a full restoration, including engine replacement and gearbox overhaul,  Hugh replaced the entire interior in 1981, re-chromed various features, and had the car re-sprayed ‘Rover Grey’. Rab said: “Hugh was totally dedicated to his car, and took it round local fetes and galas. “Sadly, he passed away in May this year when I acquired the car. “I hope to keep it in the best of condition for future generations to enjoy.” It is recorded that 223,264 Austin A30s were produced, but the survivors can now be measured in hundreds.

concert series.\nAnd the trip acted as a reconnaissance for the duo as they discovered their family history in Ireland and Scotland and began to collect the traditional songs of the people.\nThis spark of song collecting re-inspired their love of storytelling and performing intimate, acoustic concerts and infiltrated their repertoire of original songs with a smattering of uniquely interpreted traditional songs.\nFellow Pynins\u0026rsquo music employs the sounds of the mandolin, banjo, guitar, bouzouki and their voices in harmony to tell the stories of this human existence.\nThey will be touring through the UK and Ireland, playing 26 concerts in August, once again collecting lesser known traditional songs and gracing the stages from Cambridge Folk Festival to the mystical island of

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

be demonstrated that it is \u0026ldquoproportionate to do so.\nBut she found that a regulation under the Equality Act 2010, which lets schools exclude pupils for such behaviour without justification, is unlawful and incompatible with Human Rights laws.\nThe tribunal heard the rule affects \u0026ldquotens of thousands of children with conditions including autism and ADHD.\nLawyers and advocacy groups welcomed the judge\u0026rsquos decision, which they said should give children with such disabilities greater protection.\nThe boy\u0026rsquos parents, who challenged his exclusion by bringing a case against the Education Secretary, said on Tuesday they were \u0026ldquodelighted by the ruling.\n\u0026ldquoWe have always believed passionately that our son and other children in his position should have equal rights to be able to go to school and receive the support they need to achieve the best possible outcomes, they said in a statement.\n\u0026ldquoL\u0026rsquos autism means that he will grow up in a world where he will face challenges and adversity throughout his life.\n\u0026ldquoSchool should be somewhere he can go without fear of discrimination or exclusion for actions which he has no control over.\n\u0026ldquoKnowing that one of the key rules that prevented that has now been found to be unlawful is of great comfort to us, and we hope, many other families.\nIt allows schools to treat children with a \u0026ldquotendency to physical abuse as falling outside the protection of the Equality Act 2010.\nJudge Rowley said the rule came \u0026ldquonowhere near striking a fair balance between the \u0026ldquofundamental rights of such children and the interests of the wider community.\nShe added: \u0026ldquoIn my judgment, the Secretary of State has failed to justify maintaining in force a provision which excludes from the ambit of the protection of the Equality Act children whose behaviour in school is a manifestation of the very condition which calls for special educational provision to be made for them.\n\u0026ldquoIn that context, to my mind it is repugnant to define as \u0026lsquocriminal or anti-social\u0026rsquo the effect of the behaviour of children

severe discriminatory impact that these rules have on vulnerable children such as L when accessing education is unlawful.\n\u0026ldquoAs has been made clear in the judgment, this decision does not mean that schools are prevented from excluding children where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\n\u0026ldquoHowever, it will ensure all disabled children are afforded the same safeguards,

pursuing the case on behalf of their son and other children with disabilities.\nThe case, which was an appeal from a first-tier tribunal made in August last year, was supported by the National Autistic Society (NAS) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nEHRC executive director Melanie Field said: \u0026ldquoThe level of exclusions of pupils with a special educational need or disability has risen dramatically in the last few years and they are now almost seven times more likely to be permanently excluded than other pupils.\n\u0026ldquoWe funded this case as we were concerned that children whose disability can result in them being more likely to be aggressive were being unfairly denied access to education.\n\u0026ldquoWe are delighted with this judgment which will require schools to make reasonable adjustments to try to prevent or manage challenging behaviour and justify that any exclusion in these circumstances is proportionate.\n\u0026ldquoThis is a positive step towards ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential through education and increasing the inclusion of disabled children in mainstream education.\nWe were pleased

the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.  Housing services will continue to be dealt\u0026nbspwith at Aldhammer House.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \"As more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.\u0026nbsp  \"Meanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint Library/Area Office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chernobyl-children-enjoy-a-special-pets-experience","story":"  The Ormiston-based organisation has been working with the Chernobyl Children\u0026rsquos Lifeline Trust and Swiis Foster Care to provide youngsters from Belarus with a special workshop as they visited the UK as part of a month-long recuperative holiday provided each year.  They met up with the youngsters along with some \u0026lsquotherapets\u0026rsquo provided by Canine Concern Scotland to tackle some of the health and wellbeing issues they face using education through animal care.  The children are among the generations affected by the Chernobyl disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in modern-day Ukraine in 1986.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea?

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.

Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe follow up on all feedback raised about our facilities to maintain a quality service across the county\u0026rsquos public toilets."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8192520.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"musselburgh-bmx-club-needs-helpers-today","story":"  An appeal on the club\u0027s Facebook page said: \"We are looking for a small army of volunteers to help finishing off the BMX track this Sunday from 10am.  \"This is a race standard track that will serve the cycling community of the Lothians for years to come and it has plenty to offer all levels of cyclists.  \"The layout with the heavy machinery is all done and now the manual surfacing is ready to go.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"famous-old-east-lothian-football-club-revived","story":"  The newly revived Wallyford Bluebell football team has already won the John Whyte Memorial Trophy, awarded to the champions of the five-a-side tournament hosted by Musselburgh Athletic Football Club at Olive Bank during the Musselburgh Festival.

Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

She made the remarks when ruling in favour of a 13-year-old boy with autism, identified only as L, who was excluded from school for aggressive behaviour.          Thousands of disabled children will now be properly protected from discrimination in schools after a landmark ruling in a case we funded. Read more: https://t.co/wsxhdJEh7R pic.twitter/pEN852Apt0          \u0026mdash EHRC (@EHRC) August 14, 2018  The judge\u0026nbspsaid schools should not be prevented from excluding children where it can be demonstrated that it is \u0026ldquoproportionate to do so.  But she found that a regulation under the Equality Act 2010, which lets schools exclude pupils for such behaviour without justification, is unlawful and incompatible with Human Rights laws.  The tribunal heard the rule affects \u0026ldquotens of thousands of children with conditions including autism and ADHD.  Lawyers and advocacy groups welcomed the judge\u0026rsquos decision, which they said should give children with such disabilities greater protection.  The boy\u0026rsquos parents, who challenged his exclusion by bringing a case against the Education Secretary, said on Tuesday they were \u0026ldquodelighted by the ruling.  \u0026ldquoWe have always believed passionately that our son and other children in his position should have equal rights to be able to go to school and receive the support they need to achieve the best possible outcomes, they said in a statement.  \u0026ldquoL\u0026rsquos autism means that he will grow up in a world where he will face challenges and adversity throughout his life.  \u0026ldquoSchool should be somewhere he can go without fear of discrimination or exclusion for actions which he has no control over.  \u0026ldquoKnowing that one of the key rules that prevented that has now been found to be unlawful is of great comfort to us, and we hope, many other families.  It allows schools to treat children with a \u0026ldquotendency to physical abuse as falling outside the protection of the Equality Act 2010.  Judge Rowley said the rule came \u0026ldquonowhere near striking a fair balance between the \u0026ldquofundamental rights of such children and the interests of the wider community.  She added: \u0026ldquoIn my judgment, the Secretary of State has failed to justify maintaining in force a provision which excludes from the ambit of the protection of the Equality Act children whose behaviour in school is a manifestation of the very condition which calls for special educational provision to be made for them.  \u0026ldquoIn that context, to my mind it is repugnant to define as \u0026lsquocriminal or anti-social\u0026rsquo the effect of the behaviour of children whose condition (through no fault of their own) manifests itself in particular ways so as to justify treating them differently from children whose condition has other manifestations.

Ms Sweeney praised L\u0026rsquos parents for their \u0026ldquotenacity and courage in pursuing the case on behalf of their son and other children with disabilities.  The case, which was an appeal from a first-tier tribunal made in August last year, was supported by the National Autistic Society (NAS) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).  EHRC executive director Melanie Field said: \u0026ldquoThe level of exclusions of pupils with a special educational need or disability has risen dramatically in the last few years and they are now almost seven times more likely to be permanently excluded than other pupils.  \u0026ldquoWe funded this case as we were concerned that children whose disability can result in them being more likely to be aggressive were being unfairly denied access to education.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with this judgment which will require schools to make reasonable adjustments to try to prevent or manage challenging behaviour and justify that any exclusion in these circumstances is proportionate.  \u0026ldquoThis is a positive step towards ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential through education and increasing the inclusion of disabled children in mainstream education.          We were pleased to intervene in this case in support of the family, and delighted with the result \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos great news for children on the autism spectrum. https://t.co/7pPKjvXon7          \u0026mdash National Autistic Society (@Autism) August 14, 2018  Jane Harris, director of external affairs at NAS, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a landmark verdict which could transform the prospects of future generations of children on the autism spectrum, by helping them get the education they deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Government should recognise this decision and act immediately to make sure that autistic children are no longer unfairly excluded from school.  A Department for Education spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe Government is fully committed to protecting the rights of children with disabilities, as well as making sure schools are safe environments for all pupils.  \u0026ldquoWe will be carefully considering the judgment and its implications before deciding the next steps."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8202540.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"mark-beaumont-backs-new-cycle-hire-scheme","story":"  Ultra-endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont has been announced as the ambassador for the initiative ahead of its official launch in the Scottish capital next month.

However the areas first ever Performing Classical Ballet Company was formed by Julie Gunn Kavanagh in 2011.  Alba Ballet was created to give students the opportunity to train and perform in full blown Classical Ballet Productions.\u0026nbsp Despite many in the industry saying it would be impossible to do, Julie forged ahead and put together the initial company of 33 talented dancers. Students were aged from 10 through to their early 20s, and came from Greater Glasgow, Ayrshire, Argyll and Inverclyde. Students trained every second Sunday and in 2014 they took the stage at The Beacon Arts Centre with their first ever production, The Nutcracker.    Julie explained that in the Ballet world students spend hours training and doing exams but do not get the opportunity to perform in a Classical Ballet Production. Yes they may do end year performances, but these are maybe 10 min slots rather than an hour and half production. It\u0026rsquos like training two nights a week at football but never taking part in a full game. Alba Ballet is the only Company in Scotland to give these talented dancers an opportunity like this.  The training is over and above normal Ballet classes, and Julie hopes that having the experience of these productions will help enhance the CVs of any Dancers as they look to further their career in the world of Ballet.  Following on from The Nutcracker, Alba produced Cinderella in 2016. Building on the success of The Nutcracker, Alba went on tour and after two performances at The Beacon, they took the production to Barrfields in Largs.    At the moment Alba are putting the final touches to their 2018 production of Coppelia. The cast is again 30 strong and this includes 9 original Alba members from 2014. Luckily they were able to put together a 10 min taster of Coppelia on at The Beacon in June, in front of two packed audiences at Julies Summer Show for her other RAD Ballet School \u0026ndash Elite Academy of Dance  Coppelia is on at The Beacon Arts Centre 2nd and 3rd of November and Barrfields in Largs on the 17th of November.\u0026nbsp It\u0026rsquos a must see for all Classical Ballet followers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Moving forward the company will be recruiting again for their 2020 production, so if anyone is interested in performing in a Classical Ballet- Alba Ballet just might be what you are looking for.  www.albaballet.scot  www.facebook/AlbaBalletCompany/?fref=mentions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \u0026nbspTonino\u0027s Pizzeria and Delicatessen  When you think of Italy, it\u0026rsquos easy to imagine the amazing pizza \u0026amp pasta dishes.\u0026nbsp So when customers have described Toninos as \u0026lsquoeven better than the real thing\u0026rsquo it\u0026rsquos because like so few Italian restaurants, Tonino\u0027s Pizzeria and Delicatessen is the real thing.

However, it is believed that the site dates back even further to prehistoric times when it was used as an ancient fort.  A team of archaeologists now hope to uncover the history of the landmark, which was demolished in 1677, in a ground-breaking project which will see its grounds excavated for the first time.  The project is the culmination of years of planning and fundraising by Professor Steve Mithen and his team at charity Islay Heritage, who hope to provide an insight into what life was like at the castle.  Mr Mithen said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely significant project for Scotland. We are excited about finding what secrets remain hidden underground about this iconic monument.  The archaeology expert added: \u0026ldquoOne of the main questions we want to answer is what the castle was used for. We know it was a naval fortress, but was it also used for entertainment, for example. Are we likely to find a great hall where they might have entertained other lords?  \u0026ldquoOr perhaps it was a commercial centre? Trade during the medieval period was hugely important so we could discover evidence of this.  \u0026ldquoWe also want to look at whether we can identify the destruction described in historical records. In the 16th century the Campbells bombarded the castle to defeat the MacDonalds, so we\u0026rsquoll be looking for evidence of that.  \u0026ldquoWhen you dig into the ground you never know what you\u0026rsquore going to find.  A team of around 40 experts, including leading archaeologists, geophysicists, scientists and environmentalists, will take part in the initial three-week excavation at the castle, which sits in Lagavulin Bay.  Mr Mithen believes they will be able to access underground structures and objects relatively easily as the site has not been developed in the way other historic sites have been.  The project will also see local schools and community groups invited to the site to see what has been discovered, and will be used to train current archaeology students in survey and excavation methods.  Mr Mithen said: \u0026ldquoWe really want people on Isla to take an interest in their heritage. It\u0026rsquos an archaeological project for all.  John Raven, of Historic Environment Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe warmly welcome this innovative project to raise money to support Islay Heritage and its aims of raising the profile and condition of, and increasing access to, Islay\u0026rsquos spectacular and unique archaeology, history and culture.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fantastic opportunity for heritage to make a greater contribution to the island\u0026rsquos economy.  \u0026ldquoDunyvaig Castle holds a deeply important place in Gaelic culture, and the excavations should help us better understand Medieval Gaelic culture and inform the castle\u0026rsquos conservation, so that it can be preserved and access opened up in the future.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot wait to see the results.  The project has been part-funded by the Lagavulin 200th Legacy fund, a scheme by the Diageo distillery to raise money for community projects through the sale of a special bottling of Lagavulin malt whisky.  Dr Nick Morgan, head of Whisky Outreach at Diageo, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking forward to seeing what interesting discoveries will be uncovered over the next few weeks.  Islay Heritage hope to raise further funds to allow excavation work to continue over the next five years."},{"url":null,"title":"cautious-scepticism-urged-over-e-cigarette-safety","story":"  A study, published in journal Thorax, found vapour may cause inflammation and impair the activity of alveolar macrophages, cells which remove potentially damaging dust particles, bacteria and allergens.  The researchers said some of the effects are similar to those seen in cigarette smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Professor David Thickett, lead author from the University of Birmingham, said: \"In terms of cancer causing molecules in cigarette smoke, as opposed to cigarette vapour, there are certainly reduced numbers of carcinogens.  \"They are safer in terms of cancer risk, but if you vape for 20 or 30 years and this can cause COPD, then that\u0027s something we need to know about.\"  He added: \"I don\u0027t believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than ordinary cigarettes.  \"But we should have a cautious scepticism that they are as safe as we are being led to believe.\"  Many studies have focused on the chemical make-up of e-cigarette liquid before it is vaped, the researchers said.  However, they developed a procedure to mimic vaping in the laboratory, testing the effect of e-cigarette vapour condensate on alveolar macrophages extracted from the lung tissue samples of eight non-smokers.  The condensate was found to be more harmful to the cells than plain e-cigarette fluid, and the effects worsened as the \"dose\" was increased.  The researchers said further work is needed to fully understand the effects of vapour exposure in humans, but added: \"We suggest continued caution against the widely held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe.\"  Commenting on the findings, Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, said: \"This study demonstrates evidence that lung cells exposed to electronic cigarette vapour become inflamed, as would be expected given that electronic cigarette vapour contains oxidant and other pro-inflammatory constituents.  \"This indicates that long-term use of electronic cigarettes is likely to have adverse effects, as is widely recognised by leading health authorities in the UK including the Royal College of Physicians and Public Health England.  \"However, since electronic cigarettes are used almost exclusively in the UK by current or former smokers, the key question is how this adverse effect compares with that of exposure to cigarette smoke.\"  He added: \"The harsh truth is that smoking kills, and smokers who switch completely to electronic cigarettes are likely to substantially reduce the likelihood of premature death and disability.\""},{"url":null,"title":"rail-fares-are-increasing-twice-as-fast-as-wages-new-analysis-shows","story":"  Research by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) found fares have risen by around 32 per cent in nine years compared with 16% for average weekly earnings.  It comes as campaigners, trade unions and politicians hit out at an anticipated 3.5% rise in ticket costs next year, which could see some passengers shelling out more than \u0026pound150 extra to get to work.  Bruce Williamson of transport campaign group Railfuture said: \u0026ldquoFor many people, the reality is that British rail transport is hideously expensive and set to get worse.  The latest increase will be confirmed when the July Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation is released by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow.  The Department for Transport (DfT) uses July\u0027s RPI to determine the annual increase in regulated train fares, which comes into force every January.  ScotRail\u0026rsquos peak fares increased by 3.6% at the start of this year, with the cost of off peak tickets rising by 2.6%. Elsewhere in the UK, all regulated fares increased by 3.6%.  Campaigners argue fare rises should be pegged to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), as it is generally lower than RPI. But the RMT said this would still have seen the cost of tickets increase 36% faster than wages over the same period.  It claimed commuters across the UK are being \"ripped off\", with train tickets \"massively\" more expensive than the rest of Europe.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos transport spokesman Colin Smyth branded the predicted fare hikes \u0026ldquototally unacceptable, insisting they show the \u0026ldquogreat train robbery facing Scotland\u0026rsquos rail passengers continues.  He said: \u0026ldquoScottish Labour research revealed that commuters were already paying up to a fifth of their wages on fares \u0026ndash and that is before another eye-watering hike.  RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said British rail fares are up to five times more expensive than elsewhere in Europe, adding: \u0026ldquoThat is nothing short of a scandal.  He said: \"Even if fares were pegged at the more modest CPI these latest increases would still massively outstrip wages leaving the British passenger to pay through the nose to travel on rammed out and unreliable services.  \"Meanwhile the rail companies, the majority of whom are foreign state-owned, are using the British transport system as a cash-cow to hold down their own domestic fares. That is a nonsense and must be stopped.  \"It is no wonder that passenger numbers are falling when they are paying more and more for less and less.  He insisted this \u0026ldquolatest kick in the teeth for passengers is another nail in the coffin for privatisation and it is now a question of when not if our railways are nationalised.\"  The Campaign for Better Transport, which promotes better bus and rail services, has urged the Government to \"commit to a fares freeze\" while services are improved. This was echoed by former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis.  Next year\u0026rsquos anticipated fare hike comes as research showed passenger satisfaction with rail punctuality and reliability has fallen in the last decade.  Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies, insisted 98p from every pound spent on train fares is invested back into the railways.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said ScotRail\u0026rsquos fare increases are lower on average than those elsewhere in the UK.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis is a result of our policy to place a cap that is lower than RPI on regulated off-peak fare increases, whereas the UK Government applies an increase at the level of RPI to all regulated fares.  \"Passengers make a contribution towards the cost of running the railway through rail fares, however, we meet the majority of the cost of rail passenger services in Scotland.  \"We have taken action to keep fares down: regulated ScotRail peak fares increases are capped at the level of the RPI and regulated off-peak fares at one per cent lower than inflation.  A DfT spokesman said: \"Any fare increase is unwelcome, but it is not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do.  \"Taxpayers already subsidise the network by more than \u0026pound4 billion a year \u0026ndash meaning that 38% of our transport budget is spent on the 2% of journeys that the railway accounts for.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8199666.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-ready-to-face-up-to-dark-past-of-henry-dundas-philanthropist-who-also-championed-slavery","story":"  Oxford University has refused to scrap a statue of arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes, while Bristol is renaming a hall named after slave trader Edward Colston. In the United States, such \u0026lsquoreverse airbrushing\u0026rsquo has seen New Orleans and other cities remove statues of Southern general Robert E. Lee and other confederate monuments.  Now Edinburgh is close to finding a solution to address the legacy of Henry Dundas. The first Viscount Melville (the title was created for him) is commemorated, by way of a statue which sits on top of a 150 foot pillar in St Andrews Square. But, despite his own controversial history, campaigners do not want the statue removed. Instead they want a plaque which describes him to give a fuller account of the role of the Scottish Conservative politician.  A low plaque currently informs visitors who search for it that he was a dominant figure in politics for more than 40 years. \u0026ldquo Besides being treasurer to the navy he was lord advocate \u0026amp keeper of the Scottish signet.  But Dundas was more than that, according to Adam Ramsay, co-editor of Open Democracy: Hewas an enthusiastic funder of slavery, who as home secretary sent troops to put down revolts against slavery and oppression. \u0026ldquoHe was directly responsible for the transportation of the Scottish Martyrs, Mr Ramsay says. As First Lord of the Admiralty he also had a pivotal role in the expansion of the British Empire:    Most significantly, he delayed the abolition of slavery, his gradualist approach allowing the practise to continue for 15 more years than it would otherwise have done, during which time an estimated 630,000 people were transported to Britain as slaves.  In 2016, Mr Ramsay petitioned Edinburgh City Council to find a way better reflect both sides of the Viscount\u0026rsquos legacy. A receptive council set up a panel to look at the issue and this is now close to a resolution.  \u0026ldquoWe all have different perspectives, but we have a proposed wording . The council are going to meet to discuss it and we expect a decision within the next few weeks, he add.  The eventual resolution could highlight the role of Scotland in the empire, he says. \u0026ldquoBroadly, while many English people look back on the empire as a brilliant thing, Scots have tended to view it as awful \u0026ndash but all the fault of the English. But huge numbers of Scottish people profited and still profit from Empire, including my own family. It is important we have a conversation about our role.  Another of the panellists, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, emeritus professor of brewing and distilling at Heriot Watt University, is equally adamant these questions need to be addressed. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down, he says. \u0026ldquoIt would be much better if the plaque explained more accurately what Hentry Dundas did. He used the law to take away people\u0026rsquos rights. It was self interest. It should be on his plaque. We are not asking for very much. I lecture around the country and people say to me \u0026lsquo why hasn\u0026rsquot anybody told us about this?\u0026rsquo  Bobby Melville, the 10th and current Viscount Melville once criticised proposals to change the plaque as \u0026ldquowrong in almost every particular. However he too is on the panel and has reportedly moderated his view. \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to hear about bad decisions that seemingly he decided to take, he now says of his ancestor. \u0026ldquoBut he also did a lot of good. I don\u0026rsquot think the evil dictator was the image people had when they named streets and drew portraits and put up statues to him, he adds.  Councillor Donald Wilson, Culture and Communities Convener at the City of Edinburgh Council, said a committee would consider the proposals: \u0026ldquoThe Melville Monument in St Andrew Square is a tribute to Henry Dundas, yet many people do not realise who he was.  \u0026ldquoIf we can make it clearer that the statue at the top is one of Henry Dundas \u0026ndash and perhaps help people learn more about who he was \u0026ndash then that is surely worthy of consideration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6231372.jpg?type=article-full","title":"german-supermarket-chains-better-than-british-at-displaying-scottish-lamb","story":"  National Farmers Union Scotland said that a shelf watch showed that Asda, The Co-operative and Waitrose were \"found wanting\" with no Scottish lamb available on shop aisles.  And it was two German supermarket chains that supported Scottish lamb best - Aldi and Lidl - with all produce sold being marked Scottish.  It comes after the NFUS members and staff carried out a shelf watch over 50 Scottish supermarket over the first ten days of this month to identify which retailers are doing their part to support Scottish sheep farmers during peak production season.  The First Minister announced a campaign to promote Scottish lamb would benefit from \u0026pound200,000 of new funding, while the NFUS secret shopper survey was being carried out. The funding will support Quality Meat Scotland\u0026rsquos 2018 Scotch lamb promotional campaign.    The shoppers counted over 2,500 packs of Scottish lamb, which has protected status under EU law, and identified which of the big supermarkets were sourcing the most Scottish and home-produced lamb.  But the NFUS said the results \"notably demonstrate\" that Asda continue to stock significant volumes (40%) of imported lamb, where many of its competitors have chosen to source Scottish and British lamb exclusively. It also found that no lamb was labelled as Scottish in the Co-operative and Waitrose.  The NFUS said the majority of lamb in the Tesco, Sainsbury\u0026rsquos, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi stores, however, was labelled as Scotch Lamb PGI (protected geographical indication), giving the farming sector \"reason to be encouraged\" despite the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit, the NFUS said.  They found that Marks and Spencer stocked 26% Scottish, while at Sainsbury\u0027s it was 56%, at Tesco it was 59% and at Morrisons it was 73%.    NFU Scotland\u0026rsquos livestock committee chairman Charlie Adam said they would be raising the issue of stocking Scottish lamb with Asda in the coming days.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese shelf watch results show that support for Scottish and UK lamb producers is strong from a number of retailers, providing confidence to the sector. Indeed, six out of the nine supermarket chains that we visited were stocking only lamb produced in Scotland or the UK.  \u0026ldquoWhile the majority of the lamb was home-produced it was disappointing to see that Asda, The Co-operative and Waitrose had no lamb labelled as Scottish available.  \"In particular ASDA is way off the mark with competitors \u0026ndash stocking hundreds of packs of imported lamb at a time when Scottish lamb producers are busy finishing their stock. \"    Last year, campaign group Keep Scotland the Brand was launched, prompted by the steady disappearance of the Saltire on Scottish-grown food, and its replacement by Union flag packaging.  The #KeepScotlandtheBrand movement has been growing after fed-up customer Ruth Watson began tweeting pictures of Scottish products in supermarkets packaged under a Union flag.  alkers, the Moray-based family producers of oatcakes, cakes and biscuits got support in the House of Commons in March in the wake of one row over Union Flag branding with some warning of a boycott.  Joint managing director Jim Walker said he was \"not ashamed\" to use Union Flag branding on what he described as a niche novelty products sold in London and abroad as gift items and insisted he and the company are \"proud to be Scottish\".  The executive which sells products in over 60 countries spoke out against those who were \"mis-calling\" his company last week and warned that boycotts \"kill Scottish jobs\".  The new NFUS results come a day before the Lairg store lamb sale, one of the largest one-day sales of sheep in Europe.  They showed that almost 45% of the lamb available was branded with the Scotch Lamb PGI, with an additional 44% labelled as British or Welsh.  Aimi McNeill of The Co-operative said that Scottish-sourced lamb would be branded British.  She said: \"Co-op own-brand fresh lamb is 100% British across our entire store estate and we are proud to support British and Scottish farmers.  \"All of our fresh own brand lamb is 100% British and labelled as such. We announced this policy last May as part of our commitment to British and Scottish agriculture.  \"Regional lamb lines mean Scottish lamb is stocked in our Scottish stores.\"  An Asda spokesman:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe always look to offer our customers value and choice and are proud to stock a great range of Scottish lamb in our stores.  Waitrose were approached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"population-of-hares-down-to-only-1-of-level-recorded-60-years-ago","story":"  The Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology and the RSPB teamed up to study counts of the animals over several decades on moorland managed for red grouse shooting and nearby mountain land.  From 1954 to 1999, the mountain hare population on moorland sites decreased by almost five per cent every year, the study found, saying the long-term decline was likely to be due to land-use changes such as the loss of grouse moors to conifer forests.  However, from 1999 to 2017 the scale of the \u0026ldquosevere moorland declines increased to over 30% every year, leading to counts last year of less than one per cent of original levels in 1954, researchers said.  On higher, alpine sites, numbers of mountain hares fluctuated, but increased overall until 2007, and then declined, although not to the lows seen on the moorland sites, the study noted.  The report stated: \u0026ldquoThe study found long-term declines in mountain hare densities on moorland, but not alpine, sites in the core area of UK mountain hare distribution in the eastern Highlands of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThese moorland declines were faster after 1999 at a time when hare culling by grouse moor managers with the specific aim of tick and LIV control has become more frequent.  Gamekeepers and estate managers claim culls limit the spread of ticks, protect trees and safeguard fragile environments, and a policy of voluntary restraint is in place.  However, campaigners believe the practice is cruel and unnecessary. The research paper, being published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, stated: \u0026ldquoOn moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to \u0026lt1% of initial levels after 2008.  \u0026ldquoBefore 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999.  The findings were revealed after the annual grouse shooting season got under way yesterday.  Lead author of the study, Dr Adam Watson of the Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology, said: \u0026ldquoHaving counted mountain hares across the moors and high tops of the eastern Highlands since 1943, I find the decline in numbers of these beautiful animals both compelling and of great concern.  \u0026ldquoWe need the Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage to take action to help these iconic mammals of the hill \u0026ndash I hope they will listen to the voice of scientific research.  The RSPB said urgent action is needed to protect mountain hares.  Duncan Orr Ewing, head of species and land management at the charity in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe consider that large-scale population reduction culls are both illegal under EU law and unwarranted as a method for controlling grouse disease.  But the Scottish Moorland Group said the research was \u0026ldquoout of kilter with other respected studies and said RSPB Scotland was continuing \u0026ldquoits political campaigning against grouse moor management.  This view was supported by a spokesman for The Scottish Gamekeepers Association, who said: \u0026ldquoThis work is largely at odds with what is being seen on the ground in grouse moor areas, where hare numbers \u0026ndash in good breeding seasons \u0026ndash remain very, very high, sometimes reaching densities of up to 200 hares per sq km.  \u0026ldquoData held by GWCT shows the number of hares taken on grouse moors shows no overall discernible trend since 1954, despite the claims by those seeking to legislate against grouse shooting that culls have been escalated to protect grouse. The average annual hare cull of 25,000 represents only 7% of the estimated population.  \u0026ldquoWhilst on Scottish grouse moors hare numbers remain amongst the highest in Europe, we know there are campaigning wildlife charities, looking after hundreds of sites, with suitable habitat but no mountain hares at all. That revelation may shock and will become clearer to the public and government when the new counting methods are widely adopted, which is what the SGA is calling for.  Meanwhile, grouse shooting season has opened, but some estates in Scotland have cancelled shoots due to exceptional weather, the March cold spell and the dry summer, hitting breeding stock."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-considering-workplace-parking-levy","story":"  A committee will examine a workplace parking levy \"to set out the argument and rationale\" for the overhaul.

Labour said he attended the event only to remember victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) offices in Tunis.  Israeli secret service Mossad was accused of killing terrorists behind the Olympics attack, including Atef Bseiso, a PLO intelligence chief, who was killed in the French capital in 1992.  Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: \u0026ldquoThe laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone \u0026ndash left, right and everything in between.

The Labour leader faced calls to quit on Monday over his controversial visit to the cemetery four years ago.  The row erupted after the Daily Mail published pictures of the Labour leader holding a wreath in the cemetery, which it said were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of Black September.  The Palestinian terrorist group killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Asked about the incident during a visit to Walsall on Monday, Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoA wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended conference to those that were killed in Paris in 1992.  \u0026ldquoI was present when it was laid.

Scottish Conservative MSP Peter Chapman this week challenged First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell farmers if she is in favour of the restrictions planned for the route and urged her to support overturning the ban.                                                    His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point. However it has been suggested at the Turriff Show by MSPs present that if individual farmers believe they will be severely disadvantaged by not being able to access the new road and continue to use only the existing road network, that they make that case to Transport Scotland.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"relief map celebrates bond between scotland and poland","story":"        November 11 this year will be a poignant date for many people here in Scotland.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:47 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

These are exciting proposals and it is going to be important that everyone understands the vision for future care in Caithness.\u0026ldquoThis is about making sure that as many people as possible can take part and have their say.The proposals resulted from extensive engagement to explore possible options. NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:47 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:47 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 14, 2018 at 11:10 amShadow health secretary Miles Briggs joined Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston on a visit to the new Balfour Hospital site in Kirkwall.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos a flexible industry.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way.

But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday 14 Aug 2018 3:49 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one.

We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

If so, Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nSome workers at the old Mayfair stitching factory (from left) Barbara Halliday, Marie Hayes, Elizabeth McClelland, and Marie Cullen.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThey want former workers at the stitching factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThis unique history project is being supported by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIt’s a cross-border initiative, financed through the European Union and managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and  designed to support peace and reconciliation across the island.\n\nOriginally established at Mill Avenue in Portadown, the Mayfair manufacturing company once employed almost 1,000 people at its various sites in Portadown, Gilford, Keady, Belfast as well as Brixton in London.The old Mayfair factory was closed around 1979 as globalisation of labour intensive industries began to take hold. Then,  around 300 workers,   mostly women,  losing their jobs.\n\nThe Business Centre  wants to compile a multi-media history project, recording the workers’ experiences. They want people who worked there to join a reminiscence/oral history project to record what it was like in the factory during the 1950’s, 60’s and 70’s, and the impact its closure had.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “The intention would be for the former workers to meet on a regular basis over coming months and to talk and chat about their times in Mayfair. It will be very informal and a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We intend that the project will be very much led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places in the town as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair, which will not only include the video-recorded interviews but also old photo’s and other items.”\n\nAnyone interested in joining the project should contact Ursula Kearns at Mayfair by telephone on 028 38 391666 or email ursula@mayfairbusinesscentre\n\nThe Tyrone-based BEAM Creative Networks will help facilitate delivery of the project and provide video-recording, design and other support. The present Mayfair Business Centre was established in 1995 as a community-owned enterprise and officially opened in 1996. The Business Centre has gone through a number of phases of development in the intervening years.  It has proven to be a success with twenty-eight businesses occupying a total of 38 units in the Mayfair complex - around 48,000 sq ft of space.\n\nMatch-funding for this project has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8600534.1534250322!/image/image.jpg","title":"up to 1 500 jobs in jeopardy as homebase to shut 42 stores","story":"\nHomebase has earmarked 42 stores for closure with the loss of 1,500 jobs, as the firm deals with debt restructuring - but none in NI are set to shut.\n\n                \nThe DIY firm has nine stores in NI including two in Belfast, one in Craigavon, Derry, Omagh, Antrim, Newtownabbey, Cookstown and Bangor.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn a lunchtime press release, the firm announced it would be entering a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) - a special insolvency procedure.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHomebase has a number of stores in the Republic of Ireland and 250 stores in the rest of the UK.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHomebase said it was announcing the next phase of its restructuring plan and will be seeking approval from creditors on the proposed plan to reduce its cost base in the UK and the Irish Republic.\n\nTheir statement said: “Homebase’s sales performance and profitability declined significantly under the previous ownership over the last two years. In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8250351.1533892987!/image/image.jpg","title":"wire mesh was showing on one tyre of an agricultural trailer","story":"\nWire mesh was showing on a tyre and another one had very little tread on it police noticed when they inspected a trailer near Aghagallon on May 15 this year.\n\n                \nJonathan McStravick (26), whose address was given as Derryhirk Road, Craigavon, admitted using a trailer in a dangerous condition and that it had two defective tyres.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCraigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday that the tread on one tyre was only 0.36 millimetres while the other one was completely devoid of tread with wire mesh exposed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was being used to carry agricultural food to fields.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFines of £75 were imposed on each of the three charges and he was also given three points and ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brides wedding day overshadowed by late bus","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

how awful the bus was and how badly they were treated was the talk of the wedding and the day after,\" she told the Belfast .\n\nFriends and family waiting to travel to the wedding were left by the side of the road for almost an hour, when two minibuses eventually showed up, rather than the agreed 35-seater coach. \n\nThe 26-year-old bride phoned the company as she travelled to her wedding with her dad, and was told by an employee \"we\u0027re busy, don\u0027t be so cheeky\", and that the bus was on its way.\n\nThe minibuses arrived along with a mechanic, who claimed he had been sent by Allen\u0027s Tours \"just in case the bus breaks down on the way\", according to Ms Lamour. \n\nThe incident resulted in the wedding on July 29 being postponed by an hour and four guests missing the celebration altogether. \n\nBoth Catherine and Lynne repeatedly expressed their shock and disgust at the service given by Allen\u0027s Tours. \n\nLynne claims she has been \"passed from pillar to post\" when trying to discuss the matter with the owner.\n\n\"Even when on honeymoon the next week, I had to phone them every day and only on Sunday (August 12) did I finally get to speak to Ben (Allen), the owner\".\n\nThe frustrated bride said Ben responded asking: \"Did they make it from A to B?\" and \"if they didn\u0027t miss the wedding dinner then what is the problem?\" \n\nShe claims he then ended the call, and has been unable to get in contact with anyone since.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, Allen\u0027s Tours declined to address the issue of its service.\n\nLynne has since told the Belfast  that in her phone call she addressed the issue, saying: \"I paid you for a service that you failed to provide\" after being told the bus was on its way.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"listed status to be stamped on 140yearold","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Victorian-era postbox that has stood in Lurgan for nearly 140 years could receive listed status to ensure it is preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe postbox is located on Market Street in the Co Armagh town.\n\nIt is regarded as one of the oldest free-standing postboxes in Northern Ireland.\n\nListed status is more commonly associated with historical buildings, but according to the Department for Communities it can be bestowed on any man-made structure.\n\nThe bright red box is nestled at the front of the Mechanics Institute and is believed to originate from the late 1800s.\n\nThe VR symbols above the slit represent the name \u0027Victoria\u0027 and \u0027Regina\u0027, which is Latin for queen.\n\nIf the listed status is approved, it will mean that the postbox cannot be altered in any way.\n\nIn May, 20 postboxes were given listed status with locations spanning across the country.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: \"It (the postbox) is unusual as it is a design that was meant to be recessed within a wall, but for some reason was left fully exposed. \n\n\"We think there are only around 14 of these types in the whole of these islands.\n\n\"It was picked up by the Department for Communities as part of a systematic survey of historic buildings in Northern Ireland (Second Survey of Historic Buildings).\"\n\nA guidance document on the listing process for historic buildings and information on the survey is available on the department\u0027s website.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"These explain the history of the second survey, what listing means and the criteria for listing and the Principles of Conservation.\"\n\nThe first postboxes in Ireland were installed in 1855 in towns and cities including Belfast, Dublin and Ballymena. \n\nPostboxes in the Republic were changed from red to green when it became an independent country.\n\nSt George\u0027s Market and the art deco style Bank of Ireland building on Royal Avenue are among buildings in Belfast that have been listed.\n\nArmagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is expected to support the recommendation at its meeting later this month.\n\nThe department\u0027s final decision on whether the postbox will be listed isn\u0027t expected until the consultation process is finalised in September.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts broken down car on westlink cleared","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"streets of brandywell echo to sounds of kids having a ball in memory of derry city star ryan mcbride","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Brandywell was awash with colour as hundreds of young people remembered one of their own in a day of street football organised by the Ryan McBride Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe late Derry City captain passed away in March 2017 at his home in the area, where his contribution to football has never been forgotten.\n\nMcBride played 177 games for the Candystripes and wore the captain\u0027s armband on 57 occasions.\n\nYesterday his former team-mates joined family members for a day of fun and football - not just for the young people, but for every member of the local community.\n\nGareth McCay of the Ryan McBride Foundation and brother-in-law of the defender, said the \u0027Day For Ryan McBride\u0027 was one of the most significant events for the family.\n\nHe said: \"Ryan learned his football on the streets of the Brandywell, when it was allowed to play ball games on the streets.\n\n\"We wanted an event for the young people which would capture the way Ryan first played the game.\n\n\"The streets have all been closed off and there will be games of five-a-side, the way Ryan would have played.\n\n\"The whole idea of street football has been lost because there are so many places that have signs saying \u0027No ball games\u0027 or the children play football electronically on an Xbox, so this is a way of bringing it back to the way Ryan played the game.\n\n\"The Derry City team are here and the kids will get a chance to play knockout and penalty shoot-outs against them.\n\n\"We organised this for the first time last year and there was such a magnificent response to it, that we decided to extend it to include the whole community this year.\n\n\"There are bouncy castles, a music stage and a free barbecue, so there will be a bit of street party feel about it too.\n\n\"This is one of the most important days in the calender for Ryan\u0027s family because Ryan was a Brandywell man before he was a Derry man.\n\n\"He is still idolised in the Brandywell, which was shown by the massive mural they put up of him at the Long Tower.\"\n\nLater this year the results of a consultation process over the possibility of changing the name of the Brandywell Stadium to the Ryan McBride Stadium will be published.\n\nDerry and Strabane District Council, which owns the stadium, launched an online survey to give the public a say on whether the stadium name is changed from The Brandywell.\n\nAs part of this process an online poll was available from April until July to allow people to vote either yes or no on the renaming of the ground.\n\n\nThe family have previously stated their dislike of this process. \n\nRyan\u0027s sister Caitlin McBride said: \"Renaming the stadium in Ryan\u0027s memory has the support of the Brandywell residents and Derry City Football Club, but it seems this isn\u0027t enough for the council.\n\n\"It is a bit distasteful it is akin to a popularity contest for Ryan, who isn\u0027t here, and we are still mourning his loss.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ontherun lecturer who fled his trial extradited to uk from romania","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26.

Mark Beaumont has been announced as the ambassador for the initiative ahead of its official launch in the Scottish capital next month.\n\nHis roles include testing the app, docking technology and bike before the scheme is opened up to members of the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark tries out one of the new Pashley bikes (Greg MacVean/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMr Beaumont, who lives in the city, said: “I’m really pleased to get behind Edinburgh’s first cycle hire scheme, which will open up cycling to a much broader audience, showing the benefits and possibilities getting on a bike can bring to anyone.\n\n“You don’t have to go round the world to get something back from cycling, and as someone who lives in Edinburgh, I’m excited to see the bikes and cycle hire points beginning to pop up all over the city as more people see the benefits of travelling on two wheels.”\n\nMr Beaumont, 35, last year smashed the world record for cycling around the globe by completing the epic ride in 79 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeaumont broke the world record for circumnavigating the globe in 2017 (Sandy Young/PA)\n\n\n\n\nTransport for Edinburgh (TfE) chair, councillor Lesley Macinnes, said: “It’s fantastic to see these brand new bikes in use, and being tested by Mark Beaumont, no less.\n\n“By introducing a cycle hire scheme to Edinburgh we want to make it as easy and appealing as possible for people to cycle in the capital, whether they live here, commute to or are visiting the city.\n\n“With Mark as ambassador of this initiative, I look forward to seeing a lot more people choosing to explore our fantastic city by bike.”\n\nPublic service provider Serco has signed an agreement with TfE to operate the hiring scheme, with at least 500 manual bikes to be delivered by April next year.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"school exclusion rule found to discriminate against children with disabilities","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Read more: \nhttps://t.co/wsxhdJEh7R\n \npic.twitter/pEN852Apt0\n\n— EHRC (@EHRC) \nAugust 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe judge said schools should not be prevented from excluding children where it can be demonstrated that it is “proportionate” to do so.\n\nBut she found that a regulation under the Equality Act 2010, which lets schools exclude pupils for such behaviour without justification, is unlawful and incompatible with Human Rights laws.\n\nThe tribunal heard the rule affects “tens of thousands” of children with conditions including autism and ADHD.\n\nLawyers and advocacy groups welcomed the judge’s decision, which they said should give children with such disabilities greater protection.\n\nThe boy’s parents, who challenged his exclusion by bringing a case against the Education Secretary, said on Tuesday they were “delighted” by the ruling.\n\n“We have always believed passionately that our son and other children in his position should have equal rights to be able to go to school and receive the support they need to achieve the best possible outcomes,” they said in a statement.\n\n“L’s autism means that he will grow up in a world where he will face challenges and adversity throughout his life.\n\n“School should be somewhere he can go without fear of discrimination or exclusion for actions which he has no control over.\n\n“Knowing that one of the key rules that prevented that has now been found to be unlawful is of great comfort to us, and we hope, many other families.”\n\nIt allows schools to treat children with a “tendency to physical abuse” as falling outside the protection of the Equality Act 2010.\n\nJudge Rowley said the rule came “nowhere near striking a fair balance” between the “fundamental rights” of such children and the interests of the wider community.\n\nShe added: “In my judgment, the Secretary of State has failed to justify maintaining in force a provision which excludes from the ambit of the protection of the Equality Act children whose behaviour in school is a manifestation of the very condition which calls for special educational provision to be made for them.\n\n“In that context, to my mind it is repugnant to define as ‘criminal or anti-social’ the effect of the behaviour of children whose condition (through no fault of their own) manifests itself in particular ways so as to justify treating them differently from children whose condition has other manifestations.”\n\n\nDelighted that our clients’ article 14 challenge against the “tendency to physical abuse” exemptions in the equality act will mean disabled children with challenging behaviour are now afforded proper legal protections against discrimination in schools \nhttps://t.co/T8dHVMQxt3\n\n— Polly Sweeney (@polly_sweeney) \nAugust 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPolly Sweeney, human rights partner at Irwin Mitchell – who represented the family, said: “We are delighted with this outcome and pleased that the Upper Tribunal has recognised in strong terms that the profound and severe discriminatory impact that these rules have on vulnerable children such as L when accessing education is unlawful.\n\n“As has been made clear in the judgment, this decision does not mean that schools are prevented from excluding children where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\n\n“However, it will ensure all disabled children are afforded the same safeguards, protections and rights under the law regardless of whether their disability gives rise to challenging behaviour.”\n\nMs Sweeney praised L’s parents for their “tenacity and courage” in pursuing the case on behalf of their son and other children with disabilities.\n\nThe case, which was an appeal from a first-tier tribunal made in August last year, was supported by the National Autistic Society (NAS) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\n\nEHRC executive director Melanie Field said: “The level of exclusions of pupils with a special educational need or disability has risen dramatically in the last few years and they are now almost seven times more likely to be permanently excluded than other pupils.\n\n“We funded this case as we were concerned that children whose disability can result in them being more likely to be aggressive were being unfairly denied access to education.\n\n“We are delighted with this judgment which will require schools to make reasonable adjustments to try to prevent or manage challenging behaviour and justify that any exclusion in these circumstances is proportionate.\n\n“This is a positive step towards ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential through education and increasing the inclusion of disabled children in mainstream education.”\n\n\nWe were pleased to intervene in this case in support of the family, and delighted with the result – it’s great news for children on the autism spectrum. \nhttps://t.co/7pPKjvXon7\n\n— National Autistic Society (@Autism) \nAugust 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nJane Harris, director of external affairs at NAS, said: “This is a landmark verdict which could transform the prospects of future generations of children on the autism spectrum, by helping them get the education they deserve.\n\n“The Government should recognise this decision and act immediately to make sure that autistic children are no longer unfairly excluded from school.”\n\nA Department for Education spokesman said: “The Government is fully committed to protecting the rights of children with disabilities, as well as making sure schools are safe environments for all pupils.\n\n“We will be carefully considering the judgment and its implications before deciding the next steps.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"superfast broadband rollout reaches","story":"\n Hi

It has the exact same patterns swirling throughout it.”\n\nRod’s camera, an Insta360 ONE, uses two fish-eye lenses to take two hemispherical images which it then stitches together – capturing a full, 360 degree view of the environment in which it sits.\n\nFor the image above, he sat the camera about two metres in front of him and set it on a 15-second timer, so he could get into position with his spinning steel wool, before taking a 20-second exposure – he then added a “tiny planet” distortion to the image and made some slight Photoshop adjustments.\n\nThe dazzling 360 degree picture is one of a collection of stunning long-exposure pieces Rod has made with steel wool in more regular perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Rod Evans)\n\n\n\n\nNine years ago Rod was editing music videos for a living, working on over 25 with various artists across the world, but he now works as a primary school teacher while exploring the world of photography.\n\n“I must say that I’m new to the whole world of 360 imagery but I am quite experienced with spinning steel wool,” said Rod. “The tool I use to spin steel wool is basically an egg whisk attached to skipping rope cable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Rod Evans)\n\n\n\n\n“I use a jump rope because the handle has a ball-bearing where the cable joins to it which makes for blister-less spinning. \n\n“I can’t tell you how much skin I took off my fingers in the past by spinning with a rope or dog leash.\n\n“I should highlight the dangers of spinning steel wool, especially in hot dry conditions. It is a huge fire hazard so the utmost care needs to be taken.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Rod Evans)\n\n\n\n\nRod’s work has drawn a lot of attention online, with over 87,000 upvotes on \nReddit\n for his latest image as well as thousands of followers on \nInstagram\n.\n\nSo, what can we expect from Rod for the future?\n\n“If I tried this type of image again, I would place the (360 degree) camera on a surface other than grass, maybe some flat concrete covered in graffiti like a skatepark or something like that,” said Rod. \n\n“I have a few other ideas I’d like to try with this camera but I won’t mention them just yet, I don’t really like to talk about my ideas until after I’ve gone out and done them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Rod Evans)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see more from Rod, check out his \nRedbubble page\n or take a look at his \nInstagram\n.\n\n"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvczMtZXUtd2VzdC0xLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb21cXFwvc3RvcmFnZS5wdWJsaXNoZXJwbHVzLmllXFxcL21lZGlhLnJpdmVybWVkaWEuaWVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE4XFxcLzA4XFxcLzE0MTQyNjE5XFxcL3JlbGljcy5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuZGVycnlub3cuY29tXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz92PTFcIn0iLCJoYXNoIjoiODZkOGQxNjMxZWI4ZDhhZGZhYWI3MGUwY2Q5NGJmMWM2MDM3Yjk3OSJ9/relics.png","title":"bishop derry donal mckeown welcomes relics saints therese zelie louis martin st eugenes cathedral today","story":"\nThe Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown has welcomed the relics of Saints Therese, Zelie and Louis Martin to St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry today.\n\nAt 6pm tonight, the relics will leave the Cathedral and make their way to the Carmelite Friary in Termonbacca. \n\nEveryone is invited to come along.\n\nCommenting, the Bishop said: \"The presence of these relics among us today is a unique occasion.\" \n\n\"Just as last month we celebrated Joachim and Anne as the parents of Our Lady, so today we welcome back the Saint of the Little Way – and the parents who moulded her heart to love the Lord.
