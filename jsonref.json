Writers have charted the mental benefits for centuries, and even involved them in their creative process.I can’t think clearly unless I take an idea out for a run or a rock climb in the parks where I live in Sheffield or the gritstone edges of the Peak District. Some of my first novel was scribbled in a cave on Stanage Edge. Reading outdoors can be a memorable experience too, the book overlaid with the landscape.Everyone knows that food tastes better outside. Edwin Morgan’s delicate, yearning poem “Strawberries” captures the sensual joy of eating al fresco and of being in a loved one’s orbit (“your knees held in mine,  the blue plates in our laps”), describing Scottish sunlight, sweet air, urgent kisses, summer lightning. It finishes with a note of pure abandon: “let the storm wash the plates”. It should be packed in every picnic basket.Dreams of escaping the city and taking off into the wilderness can be the stuff of literary cliche. But in Philip Connors’ memoir Fire Season they form understated, poignant material. Connors narrates five months as a fire lookout in New Mexico’s Gila Wilderness, the first designated wilderness in the world, a far cry from his previous job at the Wall Street Journal. He follows in the footsteps of Jack Kerouac and changes his relationship with time: “Every day in a lookout is a day not subtracted from the sum of one’s life,” he writes.The laconic, eccentric characters that populate M John Harrison’s cult classic novel Climbers also yearn for transcendent experiences, and try to reach them through the adrenaline highs of rock climbing. When Mike’s marriage fails, he leaves London for the NorthYork Moors and is soon immersed in a world of pain, fear and excitement. But there’s pathos in the way the climbers are often stuck in their lives, how they “seem to hang there forever … like photographs of themselves, before they begin to fall”. You don’t need to care about climbing to find this book compelling.Since Roger Deakin’s Waterlog, there’s been a profusion of interest – both practical and literary – in wild swimming. Within this, Elizabeth Jane Burnett’s Swims is as refreshing as the first shock of cool water on skin. Her book-length, shape-shifting poem begins and ends in Devon, moving across the waterways of England and Wales from urban ponds to the sea. A record of swims that she undertook with words scrawled on her swimsuit, the poem is also part performance, part environmental act.Anyone who ventures outdoors in the UK will be familiar with water and its unexpected intrusions. Melissa Harrison’s Rain: Four Walks in English Weather is a meditation on wet landscapes, the intimacies of weather and much more. These essays take in the pastoral and the points of crossover between rural and urban landscapes. There’s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable literature.

I value it for the intensity of its comic mania (it’s the great crack-up novel) and its super-glamorous sentences.The book I think is most underratedConundrum by Jan Morris, her 1974 memoir about transitioning from James. It remains one of the best things written on the trans experience and it’s astonishing that it’s not more frequently mentioned now.The book that changed my mindDespite our slobbering addiction to our phones and the constant whining noise of the online world, I’d convinced myself we were going to be fine ... then I reread Elizabeth Hardwick’s Collected Essays, and now I believe we’ve been destroyed. This is what pre-internet intelligence looks like – deep rather than broad, scathing, outward-looking, funny and ruthlessly focused.The last book that made me cryIt’s not generally good books that make me cry. But a VS Pritchett story can make me cry, when he demonstrates the very many ways in which the heart can be broken. And Eavan Boland’s Great Famine poem “Quarantine” makes me cry.The last book that made me laughNicola Barker always makes me laugh, and her new one, I Am Sovereign, is one of her funniest yet, which is saying something. Of course the best comic stuff always has a dark, dark undertow, and so it is with Ms Barker.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readI don’t generally allow shame into my reading life, but there is mild remorse that I’ve never got through Gravity’s Rainbow. It’s not the length, for I’ve gladly gone longer with Thomas Pynchon – I devoured Mason \u0026amp Dixon, which is a masterpiece. The book I give as a giftI find the practice dictatorial and showy – look how smart and tasteful I am! – and generally give good old-fashioned book tokens.The book I’d most like to be remembered forThe next one, always the next one – you have to believe that the earth-shattering masterpiece is just around the corner, or else you’d give up, wouldn’t you?

There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Woodford suspended trading in the fund after struggling to fulfil a surge in withdrawal requests sparked by a series of bad market bets.The gating of the fund has left £1.6bn of Hargreaves’ client investments trapped for months.Hargreaves has been criticised for promoting Woodford’s flagship fund on its Wealth 50 list of favourite investments, despite concerns about the size of his investments in smaller and unlisted companies, which are harder to sell. Hargreaves said it was also aware of the fund’s underperformance but kept it on the list in the hope it would bounce back.The chief executive, Chris Hill, said: “I have apologised to all clients who have been impacted by the recent problems around the Woodford Equity Income Fund, because we all share their disappointment and frustration.“In these difficult times we recognise the financial and personal impact the gating of the fund has had on them. Our priority is to support them, keep them informed and ensure that the fund reopens as soon as is practicable.”Hill confirmed that he would be giving up his annual bonus over the debacle. He previously said he would not take his payout until the Woodford fund reopened but has now decided to forgo it completely. His bonus last year totalled £1.7m.Hargreaves’ finance chief, Philip Johnson, whose bonus was £997,000 last year, will also scrap his 2019 bonus. It is understood that Mark Dampier, the research director, and Lee Gardhouse, the chief investment officer, whose pay is not disclosed, will also lose their bonuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb985d0744ac977a532434b78436663271bd91e1/0_149_5249_3150/master/5249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2954ff54dfb92e6591e835454bc29d16","title":"uk economy contracts on back of brexit uncertainty","story":"Fears that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade have been stoked by grim official figures showing that the economy contracted in the second quarter of 2019.News from the Office for National Statistics of the first fall in GDP in six and a half years sparked immediate speculation in the City that a further bout of Brexit jitters leading up to the new 31 October departure date could lead to a second successive quarter of negative growth. A technical recession is defined by two successive quarters of negative growth.The chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid, said: “This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries. But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong – wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we’re forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit – that’s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of activity in the economy over a given period of time.\u0026nbspPut simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.\u0026nbspGDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.\u0026nbspThe ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number.• The value of all goods and services produced – known as the output or production measure.•\u0026nbspThe value of the income generated from company profits and wages – known as the income measure.•\u0026nbspThe value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas - known as the expenditure measure.Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation.Britain\u0027s government statistics body, the\u0026nbspOffice for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.\u0026nbspThe ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.\u0026nbspThe most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year for the three months to March, June, September and December.The figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here. GDP-per-capita shows whether we are actually getting richer or poorer, by stripping out the impact of population changes. Richard PartingtonDavid Cheetham, the chief market analyst at XTB, an online trading firm, said: “Given the growing threat of a no-deal Brexit that looms menacingly overhead, it would not be at all surprising if the current quarter also shows a contraction – therefore meeting the standard definition of a recession with consecutive drops in quarterly GDP.”The performance of the economy in the second three months of 2019 was much worse than most experts had predicted and was the weakest since the UK was mired in the global slump of the late 2000s.As recently as last week, the Bank of England said in its quarterly inflation report that it expected growth to flatline in the second quarter.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of trade union umbrella body the TUC, said: “Negative growth at home and weaker growth around the world is a major worry for workers and business.“The prime minister’s toxic threat to crash out of the EU without a deal only adds to the alarm. It damages confidence in the economy, putting people’s jobs at risk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33738545c7fda8bab24a2729b0f49e6f7396c62a/43_52_2893_1736/master/2893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9337a82d2ddd6d094f01acf3972cf91","title":"uk gdp british economy flatlined sterling pound brexit second quarter business live","story":"Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly in talks with news publishers to offer “millions of dollars” for the rights to publish their material on its site.The move follows years of criticism over its growing monopolization of online advertising to the detriment of the struggling news industry.The Wall Street Journal reported last night that Facebook representatives had told news executives that they’d pay as much as $3m (£2.5m) a year to license stories, headlines and other material.You can read more here:A small ersion away from the UK GDP figures to a story from earlier this morning: the crisis caused by the 1MDB at the Goldman Sachs has deepened, with new charges against the US investment bank and bosses.Malaysia has filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs Group in a multibillion-dollar corruption investigation at state fund 1MDB, the attorney general said on Friday.Goldman Sachs has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise $6.5bn through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.You can read the full story here:A spectre is haunting the UK – the spectre of recession.However, Capital Economics – admittedly among the more bullish forecasters in the City – predicts that the third quarter will be stronger in part because of the rearranged car manufacturing calendar we noted earlier.“The UK should avoid a recession… unless there’s a no deal Brexit,” said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the consultancy – despite weak purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data, a leading indicator.The PMIs have been pretty dire so far, but the fact that many car manufacturers will be working in August when they are normally closed will probably add about 0.2 percentage points to quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the third quarter. As such, we think the economy will grow in the third quarter, which would mean that the UK economy avoids a recession.But how the fourth quarter turns out is entirely dependent on whether there’s a Brexit deal or no deal.We won’t know if the UK is in recession until 11 November, after the 31 October Brexit date.Is it possible that a governing party could go into a snap election after that point with a “recession” label stamped across it?It’s the first GDP data on the watch of Sajid Javid as chancellor – and quite a welcome.This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries. But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong – wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we’re forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year.The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit – that’s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October. I’ve  announced an accelerated spending round so ministers can focus on delivering Brexit, while also delivering the investment we promised in priority areas like schools, police and our NHS.Here is the long-term view of the GDP figures. As you can see it’s the joint worst since 2009, when the UK economy nose-ed following the banking crash.The Confederation of British Industry, the lobby group for big business, said that much of the weakness came from “one-off factors”, even if the data was “concerning”. Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said:It’s clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty. As a result, business sentiment is dire.Securing a Brexit deal before the October 31 deadline is the first step to revving up the economy. The second is re-focusing attention on vital domestic priorities – such as pressing ahead with key infrastructure projects – to boost productivity and growth potential over the longer-term.The business and economics community has been taken by surprise by the extent of the weakness in the British economy in the second quarter.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said:Contraction in the second quarter is a rude awakening after the growth in the first three months of the year, and confirmation of the concerns businesses have been expressing about the economy.With the nature of the UK’s exit from the EU looking likely to be determined at the eleventh hour, the economy is facing a bumpy ride going into the third quarter. Another round of stockpiling is complicated by preparations for Christmas and by firms’ previous experience of spending money to no avail. While consumers have helped keep the economy afloat, it is increasingly worrying that underlying growth is largely absent. Whatever happens on 31 October, the government needs to give business leaders a significant shot in the arm to return investment and productivity growth to the country after a prolonged period of uncertainty.As expected, the manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the economic weakness – in the main because carmakers pulled forward planned shutdown periods.You can see the effects of the shutdowns pretty starkly in the below graph.There is a good argument that the manufacturing sector could bounce back in the next quarter. Most of those shutdowns were changes to maintenance timetables, meaning car factories are expected to be working at points this summer when they usually would be closed.However, the car industry is already struggling on multiple fronts – with lower demand for diesel vehicles and weaker sales in the massive Chinese market – so don’t hold your breath for the autos to drive to the rescue of the economy just yet.Sterling is holding lower at just over €1.08 against the euro and $1.21 against the US dollar.The UK economy contracted, but it is not technically in a recession: a recession is generally considered to be two consecutive quarters of lower GDP.Nevertheless it is “grim viewing”, said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading firm XTB.This marks the first time in over six years that we’ve had a quarterly contraction in economic activity and given the growing threat of a no-deal Brexit that looms menacingly overhead, it would not be at all surprising if the current quarter also shows a contraction – therefore meeting the standard definition of a recession with consecutive drops in quarterly GDP. It was the worst performance in six and a half years, as growth was held back by Brexit uncertainty and car factory shutdowns.The ONS data showed that all three main sectors of the economy – services, manufacturing and construction – struggled in the three months to June.Here is the full story from the ’s Larry Elliott:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30ba029d8c90880a4f3a2bff711a7a834f25a68/295_260_1674_1004/master/1674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13b8604e265708b5f35e349dc0f21db","title":"all the stuff of life goes on here the wine bar that bath fell in love with","story":"Intimate, personalised service has made Beckford Bottle Shop a favourite for first dates, long lunches and more As you enter Beckford Bottle Shop, a new bar, restaurant and wine shop with views over Bath’s Assembly Rooms, it’s impossible to miss the huge, U-shaped sofa skirting the back wall. It’s the focal point of the room and, as it turns out, the focal point of the business. “The sofa creates this space for people to hang out,” says Dan Brod, Beckford’s co-owner. “It’s also communal, so it kind of forces people to talk to each other – which, as a nation, we’re generally terrible at. When you go to Spain everyone hangs out and chats in the village square. The sofa is our version of the square.”The welcoming atmosphere is something the team at Beckford have considered since day one. The owners all come from a background of members’ clubs and own several other “poncey pubs with rooms, I think is the official name,” laughs Brod. As a result, customer experience is key. “We’ve come at the wine world putting wine at the bottom and service at the top. Traditionally wine shops aren’t like that – it’s wine over everything else and they’re pretty intimidating. You walk in, get scared and choose whatever’s on the middle shelf,” he says.“We don’t want to be elitist here. Whether you’re a wine aficionado or just want a glass of something with a snack, our staff will look after you regardless. We’re a sociable environment, the lighting, the music and the welcome when you walk through the door it’s all very considered because hospitality is in our DNA. We want people to have a great experience that sticks with them. I almost want this to be a community centre, which sounds ridiculous but that’s what hospitality is ultimately about – community.”Brod is certainly achieving that wish, as every customer references the atmosphere and the people they’ve met over long lunches or cosy evenings in the snugs.“I don’t think I’ve ever sat on this sofa without everybody on it talking to each other,” says customer Soo Arber. “I’ve made a lot of friends here, including a girl who has recently moved to Bath and doesn’t know anyone. She came along with her glass of fizz we got chatting, ended up swapping emails and now regularly meet up. It’s a space where, particularly as a woman, you don’t feel intimidated by sitting alone, because it’s so friendly.”Fellow customers Anthony Christie and Simon Jones say the venue suits different moods. “If you want to socialise with new people, the sofa is a good place for that. We’ve met a lot of people there,” says Christie. “But then you’ve got the snugs downstairs, which are the perfect place to sit with a gang of friends and lose track of time.” As we chat, the waiter brings some salted almonds over. “They’re not on the menu any more but I know you love them,” he says, much to the pair’s joy. “That shows how personalised the service is here,” says Christie. “We have a relationship with all the guys who work here and they take pleasure in recommending wine and food that they know will meet our palates.”Christie and Jones are self-confessed wine buffs but Casey Ryder, Beckford’s general manager, says their customers are a broad range of people. “We’re very non-pretentious and get customers of all ages and walks of life,” he says. “We see lots of first dates but also older couples out having fun, whose kids come and pick them up afterwards.”He says the small plates menu makes it the perfect date spot. “Sharing plates takes out the slight intimidation of a long three-course meal with a huge bill at the end. Plus, if you decide you’re not into each other, you can leave after a plate of charcuterie. If things are going well you can have a whole meal and take it downstairs, which is much more intimate.”While the management team own other pubs and businesses, they view Beckford Bottle Shop as a business within a business – effectively a startup – and that is why they chose iZettle. “They are a genuine disruptor within the fintech industry. They offer something different and the level of customer service is excellent,” says Brod.“It’s incredibly easy to set up, there are no long contracts, as it’s all month by month, and it’s simple to add new machines. It’s all cloud-based, which is good, as we often do events so can take the machines with us. If I was starting any business I’d use iZettle. Card machines are the last thing you want to think about in a business, but also one of the most important. And I love that iZettle regularly check in and care about what we do, because that’s what our business is about: customer care. I like dealing with companies that share our ethos.”Another customer, Joanne Hodges, echoes Brod’s sentiment around customer service. “You don’t even need to look at the wine list here. I often tell them I fancy trying something new and they just know what you’re after. You don’t have to drink the same wine each time you visit, which gets boring. And I love the mix of people – I’ve met locals as well as people on holiday and everyone is lovely. I particularly like sitting at a table in the shop. It’s like being in a library surrounded by books, only with wine.”Brod says the key to the Beckford Bottle Shop experience is that it’s an evolving space. “You can come for coffee with your laptop in the morning, have a small plate and glass of wine solo, or meet with friends and put a lot of plates together for a full meal. We’ve seen it all: proposals, marriages, dates and affairs – the whole gamut. All the stuff of life goes on here.”So, whatever you’re looking to celebrate next time you’re in Bath, try this community centre with a difference.Explore the benefits of joining the iZettle community at izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/168f01199bd020633c3a0c42d00de3f2cb84f5c9/0_33_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95ae6aa3c27ebb3e6d92dc5fc0ec2023","title":"monsanto roundup journalist documents","story":"Company records show an action plan that includes promoting certain search results and targeting book reviewsAs a journalist who has covered corporate America for more than 30 years, very little shocks me about the propaganda tactics companies often deploy. I know the pressure companies can and do bring to bear when trying to effect positive coverage and limit reporting they deem negative about their business practices and products.But when I recently received close to 50 pages of internal Monsanto communications about the company’s plans to target me and my reputation, I was shocked.I knew the company did not like the fact that in my 21 years of reporting on the agrochemical industry – mostly for Reuters – I wrote stories that quoted skeptics as well as fans of Monsanto’s genetically engineered seeds. I knew the company didn’t like me reporting about growing unease in the scientific community regarding research that connected Monsanto herbicides to human and environmental health problems. And I knew the company did not welcome the 2017 release of my book, Whitewash – The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer and the Corruption of Science, which revealed the company’s actions to suppress and manipulate the science surrounding its herbicide business.But I never dreamed I would warrant my own Monsanto action plan.The company records I’ve obtained show a range of actions. One Monsanto plan involved paying for web placement of a blogpost about me so that Monsanto-written information would pop up at the top of certain internet searches involving my name. The correspondence also discussed a need to produce “third party talking points” about me. In addition, Monsanto produced a video to help it amplify company-engineered propaganda about me and my work.I even inspired a Monsanto spreadsheet: as part of “Project Spruce”, the “Carey Gillam Book plan” lists more than 20 items, including discussion of how the company might get third parties to post book reviews about Whitewash.The documents show that Monsanto enlisted Washington DC-based FTI Consulting to help it with its plans. FTI was in the news earlier this year after one of its employees posed as a reporter at the Roundup cancer trial held this March in San Francisco. The woman pretended to be reporting on the Hardeman v Monsanto trial, while suggesting to real reporters covering the trial certain storylines that were favorable to Monsanto.FTI’s Adam Cubbage was the author of a September 2017 email, dated a month before the October 2017 release of Whitewash. Cubbage, senior director of strategic communications, sent Monsanto employees a list of “action items” ahead of the book launch. On the list: the development of an “issue alert” laying out the “flaws of argument” in the book and a link to the book sales page on Amazon where people presumably could post negative reviews. The plan called for enlisting “industry \u0026amp farmer customers” to potentially post reviews using points puts together by Monsanto.This played out on Amazon one weekend. Shortly after the book’s publication, dozens of “reviewers” suddenly posted one-star reviews sharing suspiciously similar themes and language. The efforts were not very successful as Amazon removed many reviews it deemed fake or improper. (The book won the Rachel Carson Book Award from the Society of Environmental Journalists and two other literary awards.)FTI’s Cubbage also designated for “immediate action” the “paid placement of existing blog post on Carey Gillam when google search ‘Monsanto Glyphosate Carey Gillam’”.The code name “Project Spruce” is the internal company reference for Monsanto’s plans to defend its glyphosate and Roundup herbicide business from all perceived threats, including scientists and journalists. Code names exist for other Monsanto concerns. The company’s efforts to counter litigation over its involvement in PCB contamination was dubbed “Project Chrome”, according to a deposition of the former Monsanto counsel Todd Rands, who now works with FTI.The records are part of a cache of communications turned over through court-ordered discovery in litigation brought by thousands of cancer victims who allege their exposure to Monsanto’s Roundup herbicides causes their diseases. These internal Monsanto documents have revealed years of dealings by the company aimed at manipulating the scientific record about Roundup. They reveal multi-layered strategies aimed at crafting and controlling the public regarding Monsanto’s top-selling Roundup herbicide products.Monsanto also had an action plan aimed at discrediting the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) after the scientific group classified glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup, as a probable human carcinogen in March of 2015. It had a “preparedness and engagement plan” for IARC even before the agency issued its classification of glyphosate.The company emails also briefly touch on pressure that Monsanto applied while I was at Reuters. The company was perfectly happy with stories that highlighted its new products, or the spread of adoption of its seed technology, or its latest expansion efforts. But if a story I wrote quoted a critic of the company or cited scientific research that Monsanto didn’t consider valid, Monsanto would repeatedly complain to editors, tying up editorial time and resources.In one email, the Monsanto media relations executive Sam Murphey discussed how he and colleagues “collectively get to share the Carey headache” after publication of a September 2015 story I wrote for Reuters. The story, titled US Workers Sue Monsanto Claiming Herbicide Caused Cancer, brought attention to the growing number of Roundup cancer lawsuits against Monsanto.“We continue to push back on her editors very strongly every chance we get,” Murphey wrote to his colleagues after that story. “And we all hope for the day she gets reassigned.”It does not appear that my departure from Reuters eased Monsanto’s irritation much. After I left in late October 2015, joined US Right to Know, a not-for-profit organization seeking transparency in the food industry, and started writing Whitewash in January 2016, a Monsanto email dated May 2016 referred to me as “a pain in the ass”.The internal Monsanto records are merely a small part of a trove of such records that I’m told mention me in some way. And they only hint at the breadth of the company’s attack on me. I’m routinely trolled on social media by iniduals with connections to Monsanto, many making outlandish allegations about me and US Right to Know.Monsanto affiliates have repeatedly harassed editors at publications that carry my stories, and hosts of webinars and conferences featuring my work have been pressured to exclude me from participation. And, in a particularly juvenile move, an FTI employee attempted to heckle me at one of the Monsanto Roundup cancer trials in California.I’m just one person, just one reporter working from a home office in the midwest, juggling three kids with irregular writing deadlines. So the knowledge that a multibillion-dollar corporation spent so much time and attention trying to figure out how to thwart me is terrifying.Truth and transparency are precious commodities, the foundations for the knowledge we all need and deserve about the world we live in. Without truth we cannot know what risks we face, what protections we must make for our families and our futures.When corporate power is so intensely brought to silence messengers, to manipulate the public record and public opinion, truth becomes stifled. And we should all be afraid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fe4d8761822fdb20bf98a8b6cd516dc1768012b/0_142_5399_3239/master/5399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a83486b6328970ed349d238354f1e79","title":"brexit party mep lib dems britain politics","story":"This is a story of hope and optimism. During the last European parliamentary session in Brussels, I sat down with a fellow British MEP over a coffee to discuss how we might work together to encourage a peaceful solution to the crisis in the straits of Hormuz near Iran.We had each been contacted by the Foreign Office because of our membership of the European parliament’s delegation on relations with Iran. It’s not a particularly influential body, but it does have a voice. However, what gave me hope was not the delegation, but the fact that my colleague in question was a Liberal Democrat. We may have diametrically opposing views on Brexit, but here we were striving to solve an equally intractable problem.Brexit has shattered the British postwar consensus, polarised political parties and weaponised our national conversation. Pretty much every relationship in our lives is now subject to the gravitational pull of either leave or remain. I fell into the Brexit vortex three months ago, frustrated by my perception of MPs’ betrayal of the 2016 referendum, and was spat out as a Brexit party MEP. Since then I’ve been happy to hold the EU, government and official opposition to account. It’s cost my family some life-long friends, one of whom says they are “never going to speak to that man ever again”. Many of my former work colleagues in the third sector, instinctively of the remain persuasion, can’t quite get their heads around it.I’m not looking for sympathy. My concern is what happens to our national psyche when it’s all over. When we’ve left or remained. Will it be like the morning after a particularly wild night before, when we all feign amnesia and pretend nothing happened? Or will the recriminations and bad blood continue to fester?Neither of our two major political parties have thought much beyond the immediate crisis. Both are reacting in fear of the Brexit party and Lib Dems. They are right to be scared: the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection saw Labour relegated to fourth place and the Tories losing thanks to the Brexit party. But if either think there’s any chance of Britain returning to a cosy two-party duopoly, they’re kidding themselves.Whether we leave or remain, post-Brexit Britain is going to look and feel very different to where we are now. While the two major parties are engaged in the war over our membership of the EU, neither is in good shape to win the peace that follows. Brexit is about much more than our relationship with the EU, it’s about how we govern ourselves in the future.The same issue lies at the root of Jeremy Corbyn’s problems. In moving towards a remain agenda, he is turning his back on 17.4 million leave voters, including huge numbers of Labour supporters.With a possible general election in view, both parties have been busy promising voters lots of new goodies to try to secure their support. But this is not enough to heal the toxic Brexit ide, to reunite families, colleagues, communities and the union.I’m not a fan of proportional representation, but our first-past-the-post system leaves many voters unrepresented. Our second chamber, the House of Lords, is way past its use-by date. The yah-boo politics of the Commons may be entertaining, but it’s no way to run a 21st-century democracy. The command-and-control relationship between Whitehall, devolved administrations, local government and civil society needs to be rebalanced.Despite profound differences, the irony is that the two challenger parties – the Brexit party and the Lib Dems – share a common aim in challenging our self-serving two-party system. I believe that we could both force the issue once more, this time to reboot our politics, bring the nation back together and rebuild trust in our democracy. Call me optimistic, but perhaps a coffee would be a good place to start.• Matthew Patten is the Brexit party MEP for the East Midlands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b13306af5303e7694445aab79386a53a6fafed6f/0_79_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc6f5e5a4fee8cbf9134cebfa146854f","title":"independence scotland inevitable scot nicola sturgeon","story":"If I were a Scot I’d vote for independence tomorrow. This crisis is Nicola Sturgeon’s opportunityI hope Scotland and Nicola Sturgeon realise how much they may yet owe Boris Johnson. If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster parliament, which goes on holiday for a month during the worst political crisis in a generation. Labour’s John McDonnell is entirely correct to reassure the Scots of their right to secede from the United Kingdom. The supreme civil right is that to self-government, and the inferior tier of a federation is entitled to claim it, not the superior one to permit.Johnson’s sidekick Dominic Cummings this week warned politicians that they “don’t get to choose which votes they respect”. That is exactly what Cummings and Johnson are doing. They are choosing to ignore the Brexit referendum pledge of frictionless trade, and Johnson is refusing to allow Sturgeon a referendum on independence. Sauce for the Brexit goose is sauce for the tartan gander. No wonder Johnson was about as welcome in Edinburgh last week as Donald Trump in El Paso.This crisis is Sturgeon’s opportunity. Not much is certain at Westminster these days. No-dealers are fighting with no-confidencers. People’s voters are fighting with proroguers. Jeremy Corbyn is fighting with “national unity” rivals for a taxi to the palace. It is chaos.Only one thing seems sure. In the coming months, either before or after another election, the current bloc of 35 SNP MPs will be able to hold Westminster to ransom in a hung parliament, with or without the Liberal Democrats. It was mere prudence for McDonnell to suggest that Labour “would not use parliamentary devices” to block Sturgeon’s independence referendum, which she has demanded within two years, come what may.Johnson is in a long line of Westminster leaders determined to infuriate the Scots – as a century ago they once infuriated the Irish. With the exception of Tony Blair’s partial devolution, London has simply ignored the progressive disintegration of the “first British empire”, the one that has embraced the British Isles since the Norman conquest and was cohered as a supposed United Kingdom in 1801. While France, Germany and Italy (if not Spain) have steadily assimilated their disparate provinces over time, the United Kingdom has done the opposite. Through persistent, bumbling misrule it has alienated the so-called Celtic fringe, and fuelled the fires of separatism.Nonetheless, parliament has been the cockpit of this alienation. Ireland’s many revolts came to a head in the 1880s, in a parliamentary pact between Gladstone and Parnell for home rule in Dublin. It failed to pass the House of Lords.The ensuing bloodshed vitiated what might have been “independence-lite” and led to total independence in 1922. What had been almost a third of the population of the new kingdom vanished, leaving London with the political conundrum of Ulster to the present day.The misgovernment of Ireland was then replicated in Scotland, culminating in Margaret Thatcher’s pilot poll tax in 1989. Scottish separatism, previously unthinkable, surged overnight. By the 2015 election, Scottish nationalists had won 56 out of Scotland’s 59 Westminster seats. Poll tax abolition and devolution had not worked.London now faces precisely the dilemma that faced Gladstone: whether to negotiate “independence-lite”, or face a further breakup of the UK, as in 1922. Central to this is Brexit, and what it does to the Scottish independence cause.Referendum voters asked to decide on their nation’s destiny rarely look to personal gain or commercial advantage. England’s Brexit voters were concentrated in parts of Britain with most to lose from Brexit. Economists may assert that big countries enjoy economies of scale. The Scots may be told time and again by England that they are better off under London and its subsidies. But voters are more concerned with national identity, pride, self-reliance and local accountability.Scotland has the same population as Denmark, with much the same resources, infrastructure and talent. Once it was richer by far. Today its GDP per person is $33,000 against Denmark’s $63,000. I am sure the slide lies in Scotland’s long economic dependency on the UK.Denmark would no more think of re-entering its former union with Norway than of leaving the EU. It enjoys small-state autonomy, and clearly prospers from it. It is a rich, happy country.Sooner or later, London will be forced to grow up and recognise that it has sacrificed the right to rule the British Isles. Ireland has gone and Scotland will clearly go one day. Whitehall should take the initiative and prepare a fiscal and legislative independence package one that withdraws Scots MPs from Westminster and sees Scotland rejoin the EU, but keeps travel, currency and citizenship ties in place.If Johnson really does stick to no deal – or its bastard sibling, hard Brexit – he will drive Scotland to separation. Like it or not, this means borders. To the absurdity of inspection posts in Fermanagh and Tyrone will be added posts in Berwick and Carlisle. Johnson will then have to tell the Queen that she must be just Queen of England – and perhaps Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e5c18d241fbb89821272bf6ebc0ed977e69044/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e60f690cfb1704a8cd2eb3450a14464","title":"what my summer job taught me","story":"I struggled with the machines and the pop-reggae soundtrack but got a raw insight into the decline of British manufacturingHere’s how bad it was: even the jobcentre told me not to do it.The woman on the other side of the desk looked at my résumé, paused for what felt an age and made clear the position I wanted was not a good match. It was in a factory I was at university. It was hard, dirty work didn’t I want something better? It would be, well, “a waste”.This was half a lifetime ago, long before the days when the Department for Work and Pensions sanctioned you for going to a funeral, but even so I knew this wasn’t how things worked – that jobcentres were meant to put you in jobs, not warn you off them. Underneath the adviser’s generalities I thought I saw a glint of something else, something specifically wrong with that employer.I should have heeded it, but here was a contract starting next Monday and I needed quick money to pay for my holiday in Turkey. I’d done plenty of crap jobs and I prided myself on being able to endure things. How bad could it be?The man who gave me and the two other youngsters our brief induction explained we were on trial, showed us a staff room decorated with a few Page 3s ripped out of the Sun, gestured at some cheerfully inhospitable toilets, then led us out on the floor, which is where I spotted the big problem.This was a door factory. One of the main jobs was to slide wooden doors through a veneering machine. No one had explained this and as anyone who has seen me knows, I’m not built for humping doors. Up until that point, I had lifted little heavier than hardbacks and records. Now here I was, facing a man with a blond ponytail who made a great show of looking me up and down before saying: “You’ll either leave here a foot taller or in a coffin.”There is nothing like failing publicly in front of a room of hostile strangers. There is no humiliation so pure as the one you can feel at the end of your teens. Whatever I was at home or with my friends, it meant nothing here. My other attributes counted for nought beside my inability to carry out the task that others seemed to do as easily as breathing.The other men would shoot glances at the new John Merrick. Some would walk all the way over and talk with Blond Ponytail about the idiot who could of course hear every word. Over all this floated Capital Radio. At that point, I was living on a diet of techno and My Bloody Valentine now I was stuck listening to the same summertime pop-reggae songs repeated five times a day.This was the soundtrack – that and the roar of machines and bullying abuse. To be black here was to be jovially referred to as a “black bastard”. No one batted an eyelid, nor would they have necessarily called it racism, which would have been a big word in that time and place. It was more akin to hammering down anything or anyone that stuck out. I cannot remember ever seeing a union leaflet pinned to a noticeboard or hearing about a rep and I wonder now if the lack of workplace organisation, either by the workers or even the management, fed the naked aggression, the desire to take anyone down just because they were within kicking range.Somehow, it got out that I was not only a student, which was bad enough, but at Oxford, which carried lots of connotations but certainly didn’t imply this Asian lad working on a factory floor. I fell into that unlikeable middle ground – not posh enough to be exotically untouchable, but not one of them. And it was true I was there for pocket money, but I was hardly just passing through. The factory was a short walk from where I’d grown up, and many of those men lived in the streets around my old house. I’d have gone to school with their kids, been minded by their wives, eaten the same food from the same shops. And at the same time, I was heading somewhere else.What strikes me now, decades later, is how much of this I just accepted. The abuse was the job was the factory. It was all something to bear. I knew this culture and its attitudes, good and bad. I’d heard all the names and learned there was no point in arguing back. So I’d come home, jeans covered in glue, pass out and then wake up too early and sore the next morning and do it all again.Towards the end, when both sides knew we wouldn’t have to put up with each other for much longer, I was shifted outside to the yard to sort and clear up a jumble of wood products, packaging and plastic and metal straps. Suddenly, coming out to see me was the big boss – a small, round man in striped shirt and light-grey trousers but always on the verge of boiling over. He beetled towards me.“Put all this fucking crap in the bin.”Someone else had already told me about the fucking crap but I thought it was meant to go in the skip right behind us not the black bin in the corner.Me: “The bin or the skip?”Him: “In the fucking BIN.”Me: “You sure? Not the skip?”By now the yard was filling up with half the floor coming out to see the show. I scooped up a bunch of metal straps, walked over to the corner and pushed them into the bottom of the bin, from where they bounced back up like a grotesque jack-in-the-box.Big boss was beside himself with fury. “I MEANT THE FUCKING BIN.”My attempts to argue back only served to wind him up further, as I half-knew they would. He did a lot more shouting before turning to leave, while I carried the bin over to the skip. He turned back and spat something.By the time I started work at the door maker, it was already one of the last factories around. How it had held on for so long is a mystery but although I didn’t know it then, my summer job showed me the end of a place, a way of life, a world. Edmonton, the London suburb in which I grew up, had once been full of manufacturers, big and small, but by the time I went to university they were all popping off. This place would soon follow them and the men who worked alongside me, kings of their realm, would soon be out of a job. If I wanted to get a job sliding things through machines today, I’d probably end up glazing doughnuts at the local Krispy Kreme, because that’s what a lot of local manufacturing is now: mass-producing food. In this Brexit era of licensed nostalgia for factory towns, I can’t share the same pure romance because I come from one. At the same time, I can’t welcome what came next: the loss of livelihoods, the rise of the zero-hours job, the sharp tilt of power towards the business owners and their pet executives. For working-class areas such as Edmonton, this spelled ruin.I have occasionally wondered what happened to the door guys. What became of Blond Ponytail and the Punjabi man who went by an English name to avoid any fuss. I hope they had at least a few years to enjoy their retirement. Not the big boss, though. He can get in the fucking bin. Or the skip, I’m not choosy.• Aditya Chakrabortty is a  columnist and senior economics commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0de8d4cf9e6d50e81f661ab0959b20ec4c691a2/0_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a1723b78c85dde5f10996d077378628","title":"sequins and stardom the fashion legacy of the supremes","story":"From homemade dresses to glittering gowns, Motown’s most successful act became well known for their iconic stage attire.

Exactly three months later, the Berlin Wall was demolished, putting a symbolic end to the Soviet bloc and the decades-long tensions that went along with it. It’s easy to forgot how closely these two events coincided, perhaps because Cameron’s films have always seemed directed toward the future, deploying technologies that wouldn’t take hold in the industry for years later. But The Abyss is as old to us now as Alfred Hitchcock’s North By Northwest or Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot was to audiences in 1989, and it is the product of a generation that grew up fearing nuclear annihilation. Expected it, even.Yet the message of The Abyss wasn’t bandied about much at the time, in part because that aspect of the film was badly mangled for the theatrical cut (more on that later) and in part because the presumed folly of its making was taking up much of the oxygen. It’s a pattern that would repeat itself later in Cameron’s career with Titanic and Avatar: reports of cost overruns and directorial hubris, followed by a film that hit the culture like the tsunami it didn’t get to see back in 89. The Abyss wasn’t nearly as successful as the other two, granted, but it did push blockbuster art forward, anticipating the leap to digital effects that would seize Hollywood in the next decade, starting with Cameron’s own Terminator 2: Judgment Day two years later.In broad strokes, The Abyss is Cameron’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a big-hearted sci-fi epic about the interchange between humanity and aliens of uncertain motivation. It also returns Cameron to the militaristic tough-talk of Aliens, only here a few navy seals, led by Michael Biehn’s duplicitous Lt Coffey, join forces with a blue-collar oil-rigging crew that has more in common with the commercial refinery towers in Ridley Scott’s original Alien. When a US submarine sinks mysteriously near the Cayman trough, the roughnecks aboard an underwater drilling platform, led by foreman “Bud” Brigman (Harris), are asked to take part in the investigation, which involves nuclear warheads. (Or to put it in Cameron-ese: “Jesus Christ, it’s World War III in a can!”) Coffey is accompanied by the rig’s designer, Dr Lindsey Brigman (Mastrantonio), introduced as “Queen Bitch of the universe” before Bud, her estranged husband, grumbles about how hurricanes should be named after women.The visual wonders of The Abyss haven’t been blunted by time, though the CGI, at that stage of its development, looks much better in the deep, dark sea than above the surface. At 12,000-plus feet below, the alien platform looks like an arcade Atlantis, a cross between the Star Gate from 2001: A Space Odyssey and a neon paradise in the sunlight, it’s more like a wavy slab of slick plastic. The creatures themselves, glowing and undulating like purple amoeba, now seem like a prototype for Avatar’s color scheme, but the simplest effect, of water taking shape and breaking apart, is the most arresting. A scene where a wormlike shaft of seawater mirrors Bud and Lindsey’s faces is the one genuinely Spielbergian moment in the film, and presages the liquid metal Cameron would marshal to such great effect in T2.Between the 140-minute cut released to theaters in 1989 and the 171-minute special edition unfurled on LaserDisc in 1993, The Abyss gained in interest and reputation, if only because the longer cut substantially changed the finished product. It was Cameron, not the studio, who opted for the shorter version, which is unquestionably better paced and more focused, and without the high cheese of alien beings communicating anti-nuclear sentiments via cable news clips. Yet the thematic heart of the film is weakened in the theatrical version, which feels like a studio hack job even if Cameron was ultimately responsible. It may be tacky to write a story about underwater creatures who rise up to protest nukes – and who spares humanity from mega-tsunamis because of one man’s texts to his wife – but it was a mistake not to commit to it.For all its mammoth ambition, both as technical marvel and political statement, the one unvarnished triumph of The Abyss is the love story. Perhaps those 70-hour weeks under Cameron’s dictatorial hand forged the right mix of exhaustion and esprit de corps between Harris and Mastrantonio, but they suggest a bond that may be messy and contentious, but deepens under duress. Bud and Lindsey watch each other drown and come back to life in the final third of the film, which would feel like emotional overkill if the two actors weren’t giving so much of themselves in willing for the other’s resurrection or if Cameron didn’t believe in this screwed-up marriage so fervently.In the editing room, Cameron cared more about salvaging this relationship than saving the planet. When Bud gets his message from the deep and texts it back to humankind, the line “They’ve left us alone, but it bothers them to see us hurting each other” is intended to be about the horrors of war, but it is just as much a statement about romantic partners who have sabotaged their own union.“They want us to grow up and put away childish things,” the message continues. “Of course, it’s just a suggestion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216a51cfa65143e9774877d44a547c2cca2bee20/0_83_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a693bb8afee8ce40efc5f999c8454d","title":"church criticises wayne rooney over derby gambling tie up","story":"Former England captain’s surprise move to Derby partly funded by online casinoThe Church of England and healthcare professionals have criticised the footballer Wayne Rooney over his transfer to Derby County, which involves a lucrative deal to promote a betting company.The former England captain has signed with the Championship side for a reported salary of £90,000 a week, part of which will be paid by the online casino 32Red. He will also wear the number 32 shirt for the club, it was announced on Tuesday as part of his multimillion-pound overall deal.Dr Alan Smith, the bishop of St Albans and the church’s gambling spokesman, said celebrities must have a greater awareness of the impact of their choices and that Rooney should refuse to wear the shirt.“Stars need to wake up to the fact they’re doing their fans no favours by wearing gambling logos,” he told the . “There is a clear academic consensus on the impact these types of adverts have on children.“Rooney should take the lead and stand up for his fans by refusing to wear this shirt. If young footballers see a national treasure refusing to sully his personal brand and taking a moral stand it will better protect families from gambling-related harm both now and in the future.”A group of leading healthcare professionals and academics, including Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, also condemned Derby’s decision to require Rooney to wear the number 32 shirt and called on the government to ban gambling sponsorship.“There is now a substantial body of evidence which shows the impact of gambling advertising on children,” the group said in a letter. “International evidence also shows that children and young people are influenced by the behaviour of their heroes.“The worldwide deregulation of gambling has been accompanied by a proliferation of advertising, promotion and sponsorship.”They said politicians in Australia, Belgium and Italy had introduced restrictions, and criticised the British government for being “reluctant to act” and preferring “self-regulation and industry-led responsible gambling campaigns”.“Acting now will help to prevent the next generation of gambling harm,” the letter concluded.32Red was fined £2m last year for repeatedly failing to help a problem gambler. It offered the customer VIP status and free bonuses instead of advice as he deposited more than £750,000 over two years.Newspapers have highlighted how Rooney previously admitted that his own gambling losses had been “stupid”.“I had an idea I was doing badly and did what most gamblers do,” he wrote in his autobiography. “I chased my bets and tried to recoup my losses by putting on bigger sums. Eventually the story appeared in the newspapers. In a way I’m glad it did all come out. It shocked me into realising how much I’d been betting and losing and how stupid I’d been.”Half of the Premier League’s teams will feature a gambling company’s logo on their shirts during the 2019-20 season, and that figure rises to 17 out of 24 clubs in the second-tier Championship.In February, the Church of England’s governing body called for tighter regulation around gambling advertising.“More children gamble each week than drink, smoke or take drugs,” Smith said at the time. “This generational scandal sees young people immersed in social media and tech platforms where the gambling industry relentlessly promote their products as part of a £1.5bn annual spend … Gambling advertising is pervasive and is remembered and understood by young people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd976b1355ec58db0925a2ef47bdfbcb08a14f4/0_203_3627_2176/master/3627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764813e7d14ce20687cbdcbc1c22834b","title":"premier league 201920 preview no 19 west ham","story":"There has been undoubted improvement under Manuel Pellegrini but West Ham remain difficult to read writers’ predicted position: 10th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 500-1Lukasz Fabianski proved excellent value for money after joining West Ham for £7m last summer. He was an ocean of calm behind his back four, barely put a foot wrong and even ended last season with numbers suggesting he was the Premier League’s safest pair of hands.Only Neil Etheridge, relegated with Cardiff City, came close to matching Fabianski’s 148 saves. Yet if Alisson made only 76 saves, it was because those in front of him ensured that Liverpool’s brilliant Brazilian faced only 100 shots.Perhaps it is unfair to compare West Ham with the European champions. So let’s look at teams who finished above them in the Premier League’s mid-table mini-league. Everton’s Jordan Pickford was worked 143 times. Rui Patrício, outstanding for Wolves, was called into action 147 times. Leicester’s Kasper Schmeichel faced 143 shots.By contrast Fabianski was tested 206 times and although the Pole’s statistics were impressive, they were not enough to stop West Ham conceding 55 goals and finishing with a negative goal difference. Viewed in a harsh light, the figures begin to look like the reason why Manuel Pellegrini’s side fell short of seventh place.With that in mind it might have made sense for Pellegrini to focus on improving his side’s defending this summer. West Ham have lacked a commanding central midfielder for years and it was an encouraging sign when they attempted to sign Barcelona’s André Gomes.Yet Gomes chose Everton and West Ham’s next move was paying £24m for Villarreal’s Pablo Fornals, another creator to slot in alongside Felipe Anderson, Manuel Lanzini and Jack Wilshere, and the search for a screening player was put on hold. Fornals, who helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championship this summer, is more likely to frustrate opponents with piercing through-balls than perceptive interceptions.The messaging changed. After a transitional first year it was said that Pellegrini plans to lift West Ham closer to the top six by playing on the front foot, with the manager following the arrival of Fornals by spending most of his remaining funds on a new striker, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Sebastien Haller.It means West Ham remain difficult to read. There has been undoubted improvement under Pellegrini, who has the backing of the board, but the Chilean struggled to stamp out his side’s inconsistency. They mostly toiled against mid-table opponents, while humblings on the road against Burnley, Brighton and Cardiff exposed an inability to cope with physicality.However Pellegrini’s approach often worked against the top sides. Although the former Real Madrid manager’s expansiveness backfired when Manchester City ran riot at the London Stadium and Chelsea punished his 4-4-2 system at Stamford Bridge, there were deserved wins over Arsenal and Manchester United, a worthy 1-1 home draw with Liverpool and an intelligent performance which made West Ham the first visiting team to win at Tottenham’s new ground.Those performances raised optimism and there was much to admire about the way Pellegrini got rid of Marko Arnautovic last month, even though West Ham were disappointed that Shanghai SIPG paid only £22.4m for the disruptive Austrian.Selling Arnautovic left West Ham under pressure to sign a striker. They had already shifted Andy Carroll and Lucas Pérez off the wage bill, leaving Javier Hernández and Jordan Hugill as their only senior forwards, and there was mild panic when Valencia beat them to the signing of Maxi Gómez from Celta Vigo.Unlike in previous years, however, West Ham reacted decisively. Pellegrini and Mario Husillos, the director of football, pressed for Haller and David Sullivan, the powerful co-owner, agreed to break West Ham’s transfer record for a player whose fee could rise to €50m.Haller is regarded as the complete striker because of his ability to score goals, create them and bring teammates into play. The 25-year-old is also bound to work harder than Arnautovic – no Bundesliga striker made more tackles per 90 minutes last season.West Ham can sense a team slowly coming together. With Anderson, Fornals and Lanzini operating as a trio behind Haller, there could be plenty of fun – and plenty of frustration. Anderson, the gifted Brazilian winger, needs to push on after scoring 10 goals following his arrival from Lazio last summer and can be lazy when it comes to protecting his left-back. Fornals will need time to settle. It remains to be seen whether Lanzini will be the same after a serious knee injury.Pellegrini will also have to be patient with Andriy Yarmolenko as the Ukrainian winger continues his comeback from an achilles injury and there is concern about what would happen if Haller were sidelined. Hernández is not robust enough and although the versatile Michail Antonio finished last season well, he can lack the nous to play up front. However the arrival of Albian Ajeti on deadline day should lighten Haller’s load. The 22-year-old Swiss striker scored 15 goals for FC Basel last season.Yet there could be pressure on West Ham’s attack to flourish. In central midfield Declan Rice will look to protect the back four and ensure he keeps his England spot before Euro 2020. But while Robert Snodgrass never lets anyone down and Mark Noble remains a solid performer, it is surprising that West Ham are yet to find an upgrade on the latter. There is a lack of pace in the middle and gambling on Wilshere staying fit feels unwise, especially as an injury to the former Arsenal midfielder would push Carlos Sánchez closer to a starting spot following the sale of Pedro Obiang to Sassuolo.Yet while Obiang’s exit has freed up space in the budget for incomings, with the departures of Edimilson Fernandes, Sam Byram, Adrian, Reece Oxford, Hugill and Samir Nasri also helping Pellegrini prune his squad, the concern is that it will still be too easy to get at West Ham’s back four.That said Pellegrini has immense confidence in Fabian Balbuena and Issa Diop as a partnership in central defence. But he needs them to stay fit. Angelo Ogbonna has become a rickety presence, Winston Reid has not played since March 2018 because of a knee problem and West Ham were leaky during pre-season, conceding 12 goals in five games. Last weekend’s 2-2 draw with Athletic Bilbao convinced Pellegrini to dip into the market for another centre-back, with the promising 19-year-old Goncalo Cardoso expected to challenge Balbuena and Diop after his £3m move from Boavista.The full-backs also need to convince Pellegrini of their worth. Ryan Fredericks must work on the defensive side of his game if he is to keep Pablo Zabaleta and Ben Johnson out at right-back, while Aaron Cresswell and Arthur Masuaku are both much of a muchness at left-back.Unless those flaws are eradicated it is difficult to see West Ham getting close to the top six. Yet there as many strengths as weaknesses and they have not had a better manager than Pellegrini in the Premier League era. Finishing as best of the rest should not be beyond them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9bb38840de183c3bf93e1490bd435f6adeb9f5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33cf10f15d0d74539d20c4f171ad4c19","title":"transfer window team guide premier league summer deals","story":"Arsenal had a busy deadline day with the signings of David Luiz and Kieran Tierney to strengthen the defence, while Aston Villa spent £146m on 13 new players, Brighton invested shrewdly and Manchester City had reason to be pleased with their businessWhisper it but Arsenal have completed a transfer window more or less to their satisfaction.

But Dean Smith has done enough to earn some trust and a more positive slant is that Villa have set themselves up for a return to where they believe they belong, among the ision’s established teams. Wesley Moraes, Trezeguet and Jota should enliven their attack while Douglas Luiz looks a very smart addition. NAIt has been a satisfying summer for Bournemouth, with Eddie Howe improving his squad with the arrivals of Philip Billing and Harry Wilson, on a season’s loan, the most eye-catching. But tying down Callum Wilson to a four-year contract was arguably Bournemouth’s best piece of business, with Nathan Ake and Ryan Fraser also sticking around. Injuries to David Brooks, Lloyd Kelly and Dan Gosling have dampened enthusiasm but they look ready to build on last season’s 14th place. Ben FisherGraham Potter’s task at Brighton has been considerably eased by a flurry of signings across the past week. The arrival of Neal Maupay, Aaron Mooy and Adam Webster from Brentford, Huddersfield and Bristol City respectively, strengthens the spine of a team who had gone stale under Chris Hughton. Coupled with Leandro Trossard, who has shown glimpses of class in pre-season, Potter has plenty of ammunition, including Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Jürgen Locadia, who have so far underwhelmed on the south coast. BFLosing Tom Heaton for £8m to Aston Villa was a blow for Sean Dyche, even with the England goalkeeper in the final year of his contract at Turf Moor, but if the aim of any transfer window is to finish with a stronger squad then Burnley can be satisfied. The deadline day arrival of Danny Drinkwater from Chelsea brought yet more Premier League experience following Jay Rodriguez’s return to his boyhood club and the signing of Erik Pieters from Stoke. A solid summer. Andy HunterWhile Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic arrived early, Chelsea had flown under the radar until the late drama of David Luiz’s £8m move to Arsenal. The club’s transfer embargo has forced Frank Lampard to turn to the academy to refresh his squad – he has not been able to spend the funds generated by Eden Hazard’s move to Real Madrid – and the focus has been on outgoings, with Danny Drinkwater loaned to Burnley on deadline day. Davide Zappacosta and Tiémoué Bakayoko could also depart before the European transfer windows shut later this month. Jacob SteinbergWith only £6m spent on players after the £45m sale of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the news that Wilfried Zaha is staying at Selhurst Park was crucial for Palace’s chances this season. But with Zaha having made no secret of his desire to move on, reintegrating the forward back into the squad could be tricky for Roy Hodgson but Palace will hope Zaha can return to the form that helped them survive relegation with ease last season. The pressure is on Christian Benteke to deliver goals in the last year of his contract. Ed AaronsA productive, well-planned window came to something of a haphazard end with attention switched late to Alex Iwobi after the thwarted pursuit of Wilfried Zaha and the priority of a new central defender going unresolved. Other key areas were addressed by signing players with title-winning experience in Spain, Italy and England. The damaging departure of Idrissa Gueye was covered swiftly and over 20 players were removed off a previously soaring wage bill. AHLeicester got a good fee for Harry Maguire but the deal did not leave them enough time to buy a replacement so there are question marks in central defence, where Jonny Evans will need to stay fit and either Caglar Soyuncu or Filip Benkovic will have to step up. Elsewhere, they have recruited well. Securing Youri Tielemans on a permanent transfer was a coup, his compatriot Dennis Praet could contribute more goals from midfield and Ayoze Pérez is a shrewd addition to the attack. Paul DoyleJürgen Klopp always said this window would be quiet for Liverpool, with the club having invested heavily in signings last year and lucrative contract extensions subsequently, but just how quiet was a surprise given their position of strength as European champions. The only senior addition was the goalkeeper Adrián on a free transfer as a replacement for Simon Mignolet, while Sepp van den Berg, 17 and Harvey Elliott, 16, were acquired for the future. AHPep Guardiola lamented that he “could not afford” Harry Maguire after the Leicester centre-back joined city rivals United but the Manchester City manager has reasons to be pleased with this summer window. Rodri looks like an excellent signing and will allow Fernandinho to have a breather (or play in defence) every now and then, while City look to have had the better out of the João Cancelo-Danilo swap deal despite paying Juve £30m as part of the arrangement. Marcus ChristensonAt some points during the summer it threatened to turn into quite a positive window for United and Ole Gunnar Solskjær but in the end there was a sense of deflation. True, Harry Maguire has joined for £80m and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for £45m but the midfield needed more than Daniel James and the squad is now light up front with Romelu Lukaku leaving. United were interested in signing Paulo Dybala but that proved too expensive – but the main question is: why leave it so late? It’s another window Ed Woodward has not come out of well. MCNewcastle’s refusal to sell Sean Longstaff – one of England’s finest young midfielders – to Manchester United arguably represents their best business decision this window. If investing around £60m on Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin seems a gamble from the new manager Steve Bruce at least they bring much needed pace. Meanwhile Andy Carroll – when fit – will add a new atttacking dimension to a squad who have been well reinforced in both full-back positions. Louise TaylorNorwich’s best business was securing a series of young (and not so young) talents to new contracts. Second best was probably the signing of the defensive midfielder Ibrahim Amadou on loan from Sevilla, the one position where a starting XI option was desperately needed. Cover at goalkeeper, right-back and centre-forward has also come in, with the winger Patrick Roberts a wild-card loan deal from Manchester City. Paul MacInnesThe Blades will be delighted with their work over a summer in which they broke their transfer record four times in as many weeks. Luke Freeman was the first, swiftly followed by Callum Robinson, Lys Mousset and finally £18m Oli McBurnie. That means they have strengthened exactly where the side needed it – in attacking areas. A deadline day move for Everton’s Mo Besic adds a bit of snarl in midfield when required. John AshdownSouthampton needed to clear the dead wood this summer but doing so has proved easier said than done. Charlie Austin has departed but high-earners have reduced Ralph Hasenhüttl’s capacity to upgrade his squad sufficiently, with Fraser Forster and Guido Carrillo among those dispensable players eating up the wage bill. Che Adams looks a steal at £15m and Moussa Djenepo, a raw winger, should stimulate supporters but as one deadline closes all eyes are on the European deadline on 2 September by which point Saints hope to have offloaded Mario Lemina. BFAfter two windows of inactivity, Spurs made up for lost time with the late arrivals of Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso on deadline day but failed to secure an audacious move for Paulo Dybala and find a buyer for Danny Rose. There are still concerns over a lack of cover at right-back following the sale of Kieran Trippier to Atlético Madrid but Mauricio Pochettino will still feel he has improved the squad who reached the Champions League final last season. Now to win a trophy perhaps? EAA flurry of late activity during which Watford completed deals for Danny Welbeck and the Senegal forward Ismaïla Sarr has given supporters hope of at least emulating the team’s exploits under Javi Gracia last season, although the failure to sign Danny Rose from Tottenham at the last minute was a slight setback. Nonetheless the potential of Sarr and the Nigerian teenager Tom Dele-Bashiru should give cause for optimism for the future, as should keeping hold of their most crucial performers. EAIt has been a decent summer for Manuel Pellegrini’s side. Unwanted players have departed, Pablo Fornals looks an exciting addition in midfield and West Ham have reacted well to losing Marko Arnautovic, replacing the disruptive Austrian forward with Sébastien Haller and Albian Ajeti. They broke their transfer record to sign Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt and Ajeti, a 22-year-old Swiss international, scored 15 goals for FC Basel last season. The concern, however, is that Pellegrini has not focused on strengthening a suspect defence, either by recruiting better full-backs or signing cover in defensive midfield. JSNuno Espírito Santo likes to keep his squad tight so did not demand massive reinforcements despite Wolves’ European commitments. That risks leaving them vulnerable to a spate of injuries. On the plus side, they have retained the players who excelled last term, turning loans for Raúl Jiménez and Leander Dendonker into permanent deals. The few newcomers offer promise, especially the powerful striker Patrick Cutrone and the centre-back Jesús Vallejo, who joined after leading Spain to victory at the U-21 European Championship.

Technically, anyway. In reality, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson spent last season making a mockery of their job descriptions, zooming forward with exuberant abandon and each laying on more goals than any of the side’s so-called attackers. Meanwhile, down in the Championship, a similar operation was in progress. Norwich’s full-back duo, Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons, are under strict instructions from Daniel Farke to play with the handbrake permanently off and duly raised pulses at Carrow Road, clocking up 10 assists between them with Lewis being named the EFL young player of the season. In theory, that could spell good news for Sadio Mané and Mo Salah on Friday night: Liverpool’s chief goal threats should not be short of vacant space to exploit on their respective flanks. But either way, with so many tireless shuttlers on show, proceedings at Anfield may look less like a football match than an Olympic swimming contest. AHManuel Pellegrini: a quietly dignified purveyor of easy-on-the-eye football and unheralded soother of post-relocation turbulence, or a crusty charisma vacuum happy to sit back and collect a late-career paycheck? West Ham: a youthfully promising attacking outfit that could trouble the top six, or a pick-and-mix squad stocked with and managed by journeymen, fated for a late-season dogfight they don’t have the mettle for? A year into Pellegrini’s reign in east London, both questions remain strangely unanswered, though Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off may give us a better idea of what lies ahead. Because while the visit of the champions may be read as a “free hit” for West Ham in terms of the result, the manner of their performance will speak volumes: a meek surrender will confirm the worst fears of an angsty home crowd and remind the world that Pellegrini’s biggest job in England was as a placeholder for Pep Guardiola. A bolshy, in-your-face display, however – maybe even a goal or two – would send a much-needed message that last season’s top-half finish is there to be built on. With a small army of silky playmakers, one of the country’s best young players in Declan Rice and a shiny new £45m goalscorer in Sébastien Haller, Pellegrini has a squad of undoubted talent. He also has plenty of naysayers. Making good use of the former would make fools of the latter. AHWith Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United looking vulnerable, the teams below them will feel that they have a chance to penetrate the fabled battle for the top fourTM. Wolves and Leicester both look decently equipped for the task, with settled sides, exciting iniduals and canny managers. Last season, both sides acquitted themselves well against the teams who finished above them, and there is no reason to think that should change but what does need to change is their performances when they’re expected to win. Leicester lost home games to Cardiff, Crystal Palace and Newcastle, while Wolves were beaten by Palace, Cardiff, and Huddersfield twice. Also important is the momentum of a good start, and the fixtures computer has ensured that this will be difficult for both Leicester play Chelsea second, while Wolves meet Manchester United. But first of all they must struggle with one another in what promises to be a fascinating match-up: Leicester look to move the ball quickly, attacking at pace and in numbers, while Wolves play a slower, possession-based style, probing for holes before exploding. Each is well equipped to punish the weaknesses of the other, which is to say that Sunday’s match makes for one of the best of the weekend. DHThere are certain players who look to have pretty much every attribute required to be a top player … except for the one intangible thing that makes top players top players, and Danny Welbeck is one. He has a lovely touch, an engaging imagination, work ethic, pace and physical presence, but struggles to put it all together often enough to wring the most from his talent. At 28 years old, he still has time – just – and at Watford should get the chance to play through the middle regularly. Though his reputation is as a bad finisher, unreliable is a more accurate description – he can make difficult chances look easy, just as he can make easy chances look difficult. If he can only compose in front of goal, and if injuries can only leave him in peace, he could be an excellent addition to an already useful Watford side. DHSlapping in a transfer request the day before the window closes is a high stakes game to play, and Wilfried Zaha must now pay the consequences of losing his fight to leave Crystal Palace. That Saturday’s opponent is the very club he pushed to join only compounds the discomfort. It seems likely that Roy Hodgson will take his star player out of the firing line having sent Zaha home from training on Thursday as the winger’s hope of an exit turned to dust. “When you sign long-term contracts you are expected to honour them and we expect him to do that,” Hodgson said as the deal collapsed, and pointedly. Should Zaha be at Selhurst in the capacity of player or spectator, he can see what he might have been part of. Everton have been busy in the market, with Alex Iwobi the final signing of a raft of additions of whom Moise Kean most captures the imagination. JBJay Rodriguez is back at his hometown club and poised to make his first Premier League appearance for Burnley on Saturday. The 30-year-old had a productive spell for West Brom and merits another shot at the big time, and he rejoins a club in a reasonably buoyant mood after a strong finish to a hitherto underwhelming 2018-19 season. Rodriguez’s two-goal display in a friendly win over Parma last weekend bodes well for the Clarets. How Rodriguez fits into an attacking unit that has been spearheaded by the settled pairing of Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes will be one point of tactical intrigue. The loan signing of 2016’s Danny Drinkwater is another interesting addition. Southampton should arrive at Turf Moor in good spirits too. Ralph Hasenhüttl has generally coaxed brighter, sparkier performances from Saints since his arrival last December, and has recruited well over the summer. Arrivals such as Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo promise much and they, like their opponents on Saturday, can go into their season-opener with legitimate aspirations of a top-half finish. TDIn the first Saturday evening serving of the Premier League, transfer deadline day’s headline makers in Tottenham welcome the entire window’s most active operators in Aston Villa. Minds may still fixate on those who did not arrive or did not get their wish to leave. Paulo Dybala will not, after all, be unveiled on the pitch and get to test out the Tottenham Stadium’s unrivalled executive facilities. Instead, Spurs fans can satisfy themselves with first glimpses of Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon, and Tanguy Ndombele. Meanwhile, the likes of Danny Rose, Christian Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld remain Tottenham players, barring continental escapes with the European window open until the end of the month Eriksen had his heart especially set on leaving. Mauricio Pochettino has the new blood he was agitating for but still appears well short of the resources to challenge Manchester City or Liverpool. For Villa, though, who signed 13 players this summer, Spurs still represent a supreme test for a freshly promoted club. JBIs this the real beginning of Arsenal’s new era? Their summer activity would suggest it and, at the least, the feeling around Unai Emery’s squad is significantly fresher than the drab bunch he inherited 12 months ago. St James’ Park does not seem similarly awash with the joys of late summer so this should be a good opportunity to put those good vibes to the test. If Andy Carroll is paraded in front of the Newcastle fans then local spirits might be raised a touch and the £40m signing Joelinton will fancy a crack at Arsenal’s defence on his competitive debut. Steve Bruce could do with a good start and if the Magpies are grasping for omens then they could cast their minds back to the last time these clubs faced off on the opening day, in 2011. Back then Gervinho was sent off on his Arsenal debut by coincidence another Ivorian winger, Nicolas Pépé, should make his bow at the same venue and at the very least Bruce will need to keep the prolific attacker quiet. NAManchester United’s draw at home to Chelsea in April was the nadir of a difficult season for David de Gea, whose mistake gave Marcos Alonso the equaliser. It was the culmination of the toughest spell of de Gea’s career, and at the end of the season he lost his place in the Spain team to Chelsea’s Kepa. If Ole Gunnar Solskjær is to improve Manchester United this season, he needs De Gea in the kind of form that makes pundits swoon. It was almost certainly a blip, the kind all keepers experience, but Sunday’s match against Chelsea at Old Trafford will give us an insight into De Gea’s confidence levels – and the first clue as to whether DDG is still Dead Dead Good, or whether, given the memories of April’s meeting, and the presence of Kepa in the opposition goal, he will not struggle for motivation. RSSaturday will be a strange day for Lys Mousset. He will go to the Vitality Stadium as usual but this time he will walk into the away dressing room with his new club Sheffield United. It will be an equally odd sensation if, at 3pm, he walks on to the field rather than towards the dugout. Mousset was a regular substitute at Bournemouth, and the last time he started a Premier League game at the Vitality Stadium was March 2018. It never quite worked out on the South Coast, in part because of the excellence of Callum Wilson and Josh King. But Mousset has oodles of potential, and most of the raw materials any striker would want. And, like his new club, he has the opportunity to prove people wrong this season. If Sheffield United are to confound snooty assumptions and avoid relegation, Mousset could play a big part.

I would put a photo of the kit in question here to remind you, though that was surely the sponsor’s intention when cooking up the entire ruse and I’m not minded to play ball because I’m a bit awkward.

The 20-year-old Austrian international was trained in MK Dons’ academy before moving to Augsberg five years ago. Ralph Hasenhüttl says:He fits the profile of player that we want to bring here to Southampton. He is in the early part of his career, but he has good experience already, with a lot of existing qualities and the potential to develop even further. We have made some good additions in our attack during the transfer window, with Ché Adams and Moussa Djenepo, and, like them, Kevin is another signing that fits our model of being a talented, young player who adds quality to our first-team squad. He will improve our defensive options, so this is an excellent way for us to finish our business.The Church of England’s gambling spokesman has piped up on Wayne Rooney’s imminent arrival at Derby, where he will wear a shirt number that handily doubles as an advert for the club’s shirt sponsor, a bookmaker:Rooney should take the lead and stand up for his fans by refusing to wear this shirt. If young footballers see a national treasure refusing to sully his personal brand and taking a moral stand it will better protect families from gambling-related harm both now and in the future.Yeah, but money.Nuno Espirito Santo has revealed the reason why Adama Traore missed last night’s Europa League qualifier in Armenia, when Wolves beat Pyunik 4-0: he left his passport at home, thinking an ID card would be enough to get him on the plane. “He had a problem with his passport ... he didn’t know it’s impossible to travel with an ID card so he couldn’t travel with us.”Steve Bruce has given his pre-match press conference, ahead of Newcastle’s game against Arsenal on Sunday, and was asked about Andy Carroll’s arrival:It was just a conversation with Andy. He was desperate - a bit like myself, I suppose - to come back, and of course the big question mark of everybody is can we get him back quickly and can he stay fit? If he stays fit, then a fit Andy Carroll is as good as you’re going to get. We’ll do our utmost. He is determined to come and be successful again here.

That’s not the feeling inside the club, and that’s not the feeling with the fans I’ve met. They’re excited with the ones we’ve got. Of course there’ll always be fans out there wanting to sign players. The players are here now, they’ve been shown that trust and we believe in them.Ilkay Gundogan has signed a new three-year contract extension with Manchester City, the Premier League champions have announced. The German midfielder, who had just entered the final year of his previous deal, is now committed to the club until 2023. The news ends speculation over the future of the 28-year-old, who joined City from Borussia Dortmund in 2016.Gundogan told the club’s website: “I am very happy to have signed the new contract. I have hugely enjoyed the last three years here at City and everyone at the club has helped make me feel at home from my very first day. It’s a privilege to be a part of this team, playing the style of football we do and winning trophies. It’s very difficult to do that and I’m delighted to be a part of it. I’m really excited about what we can go on to achieve in the next few seasons.” Gundogan’s first season at City was cut short by a serious knee injury but he has been a key part of the club’s back-to-back Premier League triumphs over the past two campaigns. Their drector of football, Txiki Begiristain, said: “Ilkay’s new deal is more excellent news for our club. He has shown how important he is to the team and has played a huge part in everything that we have achieved so far. We are thrilled he has committed his long-term future to Manchester City.” It’s the big kick-off!

Teachers are asked to encourage uncooperative pupils to accept overtime work on top of regular shifts.Some of the pupils making Amazon’s Alexa-enabled Echo and Echo Dot devices along with Kindles have been required to work for more than two months to supplement staffing levels at the factory during peak production periods, researchers found. More than 1,000 pupils are employed, aged from 16 to 18.Chinese factories are allowed to employ students aged 16 and older, but these schoolchildren are not allowed to work nights or overtime.Foxconn, which also makes iPhones for Apple, admitted that students had been employed illegally and said it was taking immediate action to fix the situation.“There have been instances in the past where lax oversight on the part of the local management team has allowed this to happen and, while the impacted interns were paid the additional wages associated with these shifts, this is not acceptable and we have taken immediate steps to ensure it will not be repeated.”The company defended its use of schoolchildren, however, claiming that “it provides students, who are all of a legal working age, with the opportunity to gain practical work experience and on-the-job training in a number of areas that will support their efforts to find employment following their graduation.”Foxconn said it would increase the number of regular workers and review salaries immediately.A spokesperson for Amazon, which is headed by Jeff Bezos, the richest person in the world with a furtune estimated at more than $100bn, said the company would not tolerate violations of its supplier code of conduct and regularly assessed suppliers, often using independent auditors, to monitor compliance and improvement.“If we find violations, we take appropriate steps, including requesting immediate corrective action,” said the spokesperson.“We are urgently investigating these allegations and addressing this with Foxconn at the most senior level. Additional teams of specialists arrived on-site yesterday to investigate, and we’ve initiated weekly audits of this issue.”Teenagers who spoke to researchers said the factory work has no relevance to their courses and they have been pressed into working overtime.Xiao Fang*, 17, started work at the factory on the Amazon Echo production line last month.Fang, who is studying computing, was given the task of applying a protective film to about 3,000 Echo Dots each day. Speaking to a researcher, she said she was initially told by her teacher that she would be working eight hours a day, five days a week, but that had since changed to 10 hours a day (including two hours’ overtime) for six days a week.“The lights in the workshop are very bright, so it gets really hot,” she said.“In the beginning, I wasn’t very used to working at the factory, and now, after working for a month, I have reluctantly adapted to the work. But working 10 hours a day, every day, is very tiring.“I tried telling the manager of my line that I didn’t want to work overtime. But the manager notified my teacher and the teacher said if I didn’t work overtime, I could not intern at Foxconn and that would affect my graduation and scholarship applications at the school.“I had no choice, I could only endure this.”According to the documents, Foxconn managers need students, who mostly stay in the factory’s dormitories, to work overtime to meet production targets those who refuse are let go by the factory, researchers found.A document states: “Student interns who don’t work overtime will not only affect the production goal but also affect their willingness to work. Student interns need to work overtime.”The documents were leaked to labour rights group China Labor Watch and shared with the .“To fulfil the shortage of the labour force and lower the cost of labour recruitment, we would like to cooperate with local schools to recruit student interns,” read one document before listing the advantages of recruiting schoolchildren.“Low labour cost, can hire a large amount of labour at once, easier to reassign additional workers to other positions, strong ability to learn new things.”Company documents show that Foxconn pays interns a total of 16.54 yuan an hour (£1.93) inclusive of overtime and other add-ons, with a basic salary of £1.18 an hour. Experienced agency workers, known as dispatch workers, cost the company 20.18 yuan an hour. The documents also show that Foxconn has cut the rate paid to interns since last year.Amazon said in January that it had sold more than 100m Alexa devices which rival Google Home in the market for virtual voice assistants used to control domestic appliances and functions. They cost from around $50 in the US, £50 in the UK and A$79 in Australia, but can be three times more expensive for more sophisticated models.The factory pays schools 500 yuan a month for each pupil they provide. One company document shows agreements with four schools to provide a total of 900 pupils to work in the factory, though other documents outline plans to recruit up to 1,800 interns this year.Foxconn’s documents show that the company has wrestled with the issue of hiring schoolchildren as workers but decided that the benefits outweigh the risks.Notes from a meeting to review the intern-hiring policy on 25 July this year reveal that without students the factory may not be able to hit production targets. The meeting was told that students are cheaper to hire than agency workers, which the factory also uses to cover peak production periods as an alternative to hiring regular staff.The meeting was told that some children were refusing to work nightshifts and overtime, and there was a need for teachers to intervene.“Nightshift line leaders should check in with student interns and teachers more often, and report back any abnormal situation so that teachers can persuade students to work nightshifts and overtime.”If children continued to refuse to work the additional hours, the meeting was told that teachers should file a resignation letter on their behalf.The student intern recruitment review meeting, which involved staff from the Echo production line, the production control department and the human resources department, reached an agreement to recruit student workers in large numbers. “They advised to recruit student workers to resolve the labour shortage problem during peak season,” a record of the meeting notes.Amazon agreed a deal with Foxconn in 2017 to add 15 new production lines to the factory and hire thousands of new workers to ramp up production of its Echo and Echo Dot devices and Kindle tablets.But last year the Observer revealed how the factory was using more agency workers than permitted by Chinese law to avoid having to recruit permanent staff to cover busy months. Many were working overtime hours far in excess of the usual legal limit of 36 hours a month.In response, Amazon admitted that independent auditors had identified areas of concern at the factory. Foxconn promised to reduce its reliance on agency staff and said agency workers were to be offered the chance to become regular employees.Commenting on the latest revelations, Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, called on Amazon and Foxconn to allow independent monitoring of working conditions to prevent breaches of labour law.“It is only when the company allows independent parties to monitor the working conditions that rights violations at the factory can be effectively addressed,” he said.“Recruiting a large number of dispatch workers and forcing student workers to work overtime and nightshifts is illegal, and Foxconn is well aware of this. However, because it increases their profits, they will continue to recruit dispatch and student workers.”The leaked documents also reveal that Foxconn has faced problems as a result of the trade war between the US and China, with the cost of raw materials increasing and some orders lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8b94b99c04486e3b53ff26b43d6d7617df84821/0_0_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a99d5ea9e8b2fc45371b87db11ed7954","title":"experience im a world class whistler","story":"I do between 75 and 100 concerts a year and earn twice as much as I did as a nurseI started whistling when I was about four years old. We lived in the Eindhoven area of the Netherlands, and my dad whistled all the time. It was impossible for him to whistle out of tune. He whistled a lot of Bach, but also the Beatles. We whistled TV theme tunes together – him whistling one note, and me the next. I immediately produced a nice tone. Within a few years, I was better than he was.By 2003, when I was 34, I was working as a psychiatric nurse, and had three young kids. That year we had a big Christmas dinner for the family, and I remember whistling along to cheesy tunes like Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer. My sister-in-law asked me to stop several times. At one point, I said: “If there was a competition, I would enter.” Two weeks later, I received a text from her: “Geert, you’re going to America. I’ve just entered you for the World Whistling Championships.”The auditorium was in a high school in Louisburg, North Carolina. Everything was overwhelming. There were about 30 contestants – some terrible, some very good. Some people were really, really competitive. It lasted two days – and I won. The prize was a big trophy covered with American flags and eagles. I had to go through customs with three trophies: one for classical, one for popular and one for grand champion.After that, I started receiving my first invitations to do concerts – mostly classical, accompanied by symphony orchestras, string quartets or, sometimes, just a piano. I was aware that I was the odd one out on the line-ups, and I had yet to turn professional.Then in 2007, I was asked to whistle in a big church in Leiden by an entertainment company. I knew it would be special – the queen of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix, would be there.Normally at a concert there is a little security, but this was another level, with sniffer dogs. A lot of the performers, who included musicians and ballet dancers, were pretty nervous. When the queen came in, a weird frisson went through the audience. I whistled Czardas by Vittorio Monti it’s a virtuoso violin piece that starts dramatically, then gets faster and faster in the third part there are some really high notes.There was a circus performer in a feathered bird costume, hidden in the church ceiling. When I started my second piece, In A Sentimental Mood by Duke Ellington, she descended on a hoop and landed on the grand piano. Then I helped my “bird” down.The queen was very appreciative: it was a special moment. I’m not a big royalist, but I saw what she means to a lot of people.Now, I’m a professional whistler. I made the transition last summer I had been working with homeless people, and felt close to burnout. Then Cirque du Soleil emailed me to say they were looking for a whistler. I went to Montreal to audition and they hired me in October I’m travelling with them at the moment. I open the Corteo show as the ringmaster. At one point I whistle Twinkle Twinkle Little Star as beautifully as I can. Then I go into a duet with the violinist, backed by an orchestra.I do between 75 and 100 concerts a year and earn twice as much as I did as a nurse. I also run whistling workshops. I practise all day, but it’s hard for me not to whistle. I like to whistle recorder concertos by Vivaldi, but also jazz or blues. I love to improvise.The whistling community is getting bigger and bigger, and we often meet each other at tournaments. I’ve judged the past two World Whistling Championships. There’s a Japanese whistler, Akiko Shibata, who I think is brilliant. She’s one of my favourite whistlers right now.If people want to get into whistling, and they can afford it, they should go to the championships. There are also videos on the internet that can give you a feel for the quality of some of the top whistlers. The best advice is to keep it joyful.It’s unbelievable that I get to see the world just because I can whistle well. It’s really silly. But the key is not to take it too seriously.• As told to Ralph JonesDo you have an experience to share?

Maybe you’ll then leave it somewhere, and it will transform someone else’sSomething I will always, always remember because, even at age 15 or so, it brought me such joy, was when I bought on eBay a first edition of Sylvia Plath’s Crossing The Water collection (of course I did), and stuck to the page of the poem A Life was a squished dead fly.I own a lot of books. Whenever I look for a new place to live, there must be a surfeit of shelving or the space to create it. The books come to me in various ways: as gifts, as new hardbacks from independent bookshops, as last-minute airport paperbacks, sent to the office by publishers (thank you), Amazon deals (I don’t think any of us are innocent of that). My favourites are secondhand editions.A Life is a good way to describe it books have lives. No two people read a book in the same way – each of us brings our experience to bear on a text. The exciting thing about a secondhand book is that one knows at least one other person has done precisely that. While we might not have insight into how exactly that played out, we do have a glimpse into the book’s journey. So many clues, each book a sort of Sherlock Holmes case to crack. A handwritten message to a lover in the inside fold (what ensued?) The notes of a GCSE student getting to grips with their set text. (Did they pass? Their bored jottings suggest not.) Postcards as bookmarks that flutter out from two-thirds in (was the book ever finished?)The pages yellowed by sunlight. The glorious, musty smell of old classics. A price given in shillings. Pages stuck together from sweaty hands. Crinkled pages from a spilt glass of water or a damp loft. Sand in the centrefold of a trashy beach-holiday read. The jacket of a beautifully designed Penguin Modern Classic clinging on by a sliver of glue. Or detached pages, taped back in.I love the smell of new books, too, fresh from the printers. But it’s the same difference as buying a brand new top and a vintage dress: you know nobody has gone out and danced the night away in your H\u0026ampM tee. Nobody laid their hands upon it, around their partner’s waist.With secondhand things, you might pick up a book that changed a person’s life. And that book might change your life. Maybe you will leave it somewhere accidentally, and it will transform someone else’s life. Or perhaps they will hate it. That’s the thing about getting a secondhand book: you get two stories in one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bf77cbb66c344b63f76d6f7ba49c4599abf8aa/0_120_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4694aa519e0b2156a26c3be56c7e7de3","title":"way to go how to save for the big moments in life","story":"Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good planning for your financial freedomMany of life’s most important milestones – buying your first home, getting married, starting a family and preparing for retirement – have one thing in common: the need for money. The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

Across social media, even hard bitten, seen-it-all old ravers have been celebrating the film – now on iPlayer – and Deller says feedback he has had on Twitter has been almost universally good, “apart from one guy with a Brexit party icon who said ‘I was expecting to relive the best days of my life but you’ve ruined it with this leftwing propaganda’”.The premise of the documentary is pretty straightforward: contextualising the acid houserave moment in the social movements of the 1980s: the miners’ strike, the Traveller convoys, British-Caribbean soundsystem culture and, of course, the LGBT culture of Chicago that birthed house itself. But rather than, as Deller puts it, “the standard BBC Four documentary where it’s middle-aged men talking with their record collections behind them, then some unattributed archive and a voiceover”, it’s structured more interestingly – as you would hope from a Turner prize-winning artist such as Deller.Not only is the archive footage carefully sourced to avoid the familiar and presented in longer chunks than usual – “a minute or two at a time, so you can delve into it, absorb it, take it seriously, get lost in it, almost” – it is framed as a lecture by Deller, delivered to a class of A-level politics students, whose often bemused reactions are as important as the material presented. Looking partially through the eyes of people born in 2002 and 2003 really makes 1989 look like another world.There is clearly something in the air right now. The film comes as the Sweet Harmony exhibition (named, like Everybody in the Place, after an XL Records rave hit) is running at the Saatchi gallery in London, while the buzz is still high on Brian Welsh’s independent movie Beats, a delightfully touching “universal story of friendship, rebellion and the irresistible power of gathered youth” set around the Scottish rave scene in 1994. At a recent Q\u0026ampA with Welsh following a screening of his film, it was striking how much the audience was dominated by people who were not born when the film is set – and their fascination with the details of the rave movement was palpable. Meanwhile, Radio 1 playlists are full of records by contemporary artists such as Chase \u0026amp Status and High Contrast, who hark back to early 90s moments of rave intensity.Why this sudden interest? “Now and the 80s,” says Deller, “are both eras that are quite rightwing, reactionary moments in British history, and music and popular culture are good ways to explore people’s reactions to that.” Even around the 2008 economic crash, he thinks, when 20 years of acid house could have been a significant milestone, “I don’t think we knew what we were in for”. It is only now, after nearly 10 years of coalitionTory rule, that the conditions a decade of Thatcherism fomented seem grimly familiar.“Also,” Deller says, “I think it’s the media. For a very long time during and after, people didn’t take the movement seriously. The media was still obsessed with punk and rock music, with that Bob Dylan sense that everything had to have ‘meaningful’ lyrics. And then with Britpop, which was for the most part reactionary, comforting and familiar. Electronic music hasn’t been given the credit it deserved in terms of forcing social change and being a driver of change and youth culture.”Not that rave was a utopia – and the film doesn’t paint it as such. On one hand, Deller is indeed fascinated with the grassroots, “self-organising” movement as a site of a weird, psychedelic kind of social cohesion. “I wanted to show how a rave in Blackburn that was a couple of quid on the door was different from a rave by the M25 that cost loads and had these huge lasers and so on,” he says. “These clubs were meccas in towns, they were places people made pilgrimages to. The Eclipse in Coventry, Hangar 13 in Ayr, Shelley’s in Stoke, these were legendary places, but every town had a hub like this, even if it was a really small e kind of place, where you could access this music and culture.” But on the other, he recognises the capitalist hustle of it, hence his focus on Paul Staines – then the publicist for uber-yuppie acid house “Mr Big” Tony Colston-Hayter, now the mastermind behind scurrilous hard-right gossip site Guido Fawkes.The presence of Staines, Colston-Hayter (now in jail for digital financial fraud) and plenty of conservative andor capitalist-minded people who grew up to be like his Brexit party-badged critic, was, reckons Deller, inevitable. “If something is really exciting, is the new thing, everyone’s going to get involved.” But he is clear that many of these people helped drive rave’s futurism.“It’s not surprising,” he says, “that Staines and Colston-Hayter met at a video game competition in the 80s. I think they were writing software, as well. They were interested in technology before rave, then they got into rave where you had this whole futuristic vision with robots, VR, video games, electronic music and mobile phones getting some of their first use to organise parties – then Staines applied the same mentality to politics: his website is anti-establishment, disruptive, cheeky, but very seriously political. He’s not on our side, but this is what he’s doing.” Staines was, it turns out, delighted by Deller’s description of him as “an agent of chaos”.For all that Deller quotes Marx in the film, and depicts social movements with some of the romantic fervour of a convert, he didn’t go to the biggest raves of the acid era and was only seriously drawn into the culture towards the end of the period covered in the film. It is really a story about complexity and ambiguity in British cultural history. A key scene shows footage of old, conservative-looking folk in Salisbury in 1986, defending Travellers against police brutality – and the 2019 teenagers viewing the archive being obviously surprised by this.“The old guy in that,” says Deller, “would have been a young man in the 1930s, he would have known about people being persecuted, really known what a police state was, what it led to, what genocide was. People of that generation could be brilliantly pro-Europe, anti-authoritarianism, and that – obviously – shocked a lot of the students watching. If there was something that came out of it for these kids watching, it was recent history in Britain being a little less predictable and a little more chaotic than they thought.” Likewise, the story of rave itself is an attempt to get away from “Fatboy Slim reminiscing surrounded by smiley faces, or the same old stories about London, 88, a bunch of lads go to Ibiza and so on ...” – instead bringing out the tangled inidual life stories and macro social flows of a real mass movement.The misty-eyed idealism is there, though, and a certain innocence. Drugs are deliberately underplayed, partly to emphasise other, untold elements to the story, but mainly because Deller wouldn’t have been allowed into the school if he had been seen to be promoting drug use. But it is obvious he believes that there’s something for a young generation to connect to, even if the class of rather serious-looking youngsters care more for grime and rap. Deller rhapsodises about watching Glastonbury 2019 on TV, seeing a sea of people reciting Stormzy and Dave lyrics en masse. “That music has gone throughout the country,” he says, “and is felt intensely by this generation, it was like 2-Tone. That is such a great contrast to what’s going on politically, it gives you hope. Like rave, it’s not nostalgic – it is about the future.”Most of all, he thinks, people yearn for physical connection – and that is what has allowed acid house to become, rather than a nostalgia industry like Britpop, a living folk culture, which still has the power to bewitch and lead astray, to be an agent of chaos, for better or worse. “Twenty-thousand people in a field, who’ve come there through word of mouth, things like that give a warmth to memories of this music and culture. You can’t go back from that if you’ve had nights like that. If you’ve shared moments like that with people, you’re changed and you’re connected to them for good.”Everybody in the Place: an Incomplete History of Britain 1984-1992 is on BBC iPlayer until 1 September.

Having long outlived the terrors of nu-metal, the Iowan masked behemoths’ last album, .5: The Gray Chapter, channelled their grief at founding bassist Paul Gray’s fatal overdose. This sixth album’s similarly tortuous gestation included frontmanbest-selling author Corey Taylor’s marriage break-up and a bizarre incident where guitarist Mick Thomson was stabbed in the head by his brother. With so much to be furious about, We Are Not Your Kind contains their most brutal music and yet, albeit occasionally, their gentlest too. The 14 songs push their sonic envelope, meaning that their trademark hooligan riffola and tribal drumming co-exist with experimental krautrock and (gulp) acoustic strums. The electro-pulsing My Pain and avant garde, percussive Spiders have a whiff of Depeche Mode about them, while the silky chorus of the otherwise punky metal Nero Forte wouldn’t be out of place in a mainstream pop banger.Taylor typifies the album’s extremes, mixing guttural roars with catchy singing and addressing self-esteem, depression and alcohol abuse with unflinching rawness. The epic, choir-augmented, anti-religious Unsainted may or may not contain a reference to ex-wife Stephanie Luby (“You didn’t want me … so I’m setting you free”), but he certainly doesn’t sound as if he would welcome being told, “Plenty more fish in the sea, mate”. Overall, it’s an album designed to thrill and perhaps tentatively expand their fanbase, while the fiercely synth-rocking Solway Firth duly raises a middle finger to everybody else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d60c149ff0656c5c0f3474e1c62ad49589310361/361_102_1829_1097/master/1829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d4bd554d2caa60917a9b95407f09bd","title":"taylor swift reveals why she took a stand for lgbtq rights","story":"Singer says facing her previous lack of advocacy had been ‘kind of devastating’Taylor Swift says she felt compelled to publicly champion LGBTQ causes in recent months because rights are being “stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male” in the US today.The singer, who has been criticised in the past for not speaking up on political issues, particularly during the 2016 US presidential election campaign, discussed her recent shift to advocacy in a rare interview with Vogue magazine.“Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” she says in the September issue.“I didn’t realise until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of.”Swift’s latest music video, You Need to Calm Down, featured some of the US’s most prominent queer celebrities and ended with a direct plea for fans to sign a petition in support of the Equality Act, to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools and other public accommodations.It followed a social media post in the lead-up to the 2018 midterms condemning the Republican senator for Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn, over her record on gay rights, which drew a rebuke from president Donald Trump.The music video, and her recent conversion to prominent LGBTQ ally, have drawn praise as well as criticism – with some accusing Swift of “queerbaiting” and performative allyship.In the magazine, she describes a conversation with friend and fellow singer Todrick Hall which she says left her feeling “devastated” she had not been vocal enough in her support for the LGBTQ community.“Maybe a year or two ago, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, ‘What would you do if your son was gay?’” she says.“The fact that he had to ask me … shocked me and made me realise that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,” she says.“If he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,” she goes on. “It was kind of devastating to realise that I hadn’t been publicly clear about that.”Swift also discusses the toll a public feud with Kim Kardashian West in 2016 took on her wellbeing.“A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,” she says.“I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.”“When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, ‘kill yourself’.”She goes on to say that making music was the only way she could preserve her mental health at the time.The singer’s latest album, Lover, is due to be released on 23 August. In Vogue, she teased two forthcoming songs from the album – the title track Lover, and The Man, which she describes as a “thought experiment” of what her life would have been like if she were male."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490f097690fa07435ff99047919b5c7fa3492e8a/0_167_4289_2574/master/4289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b334de4359a7a135dc51e0596908666","title":"simone biles usa gymn","story":"It’s not always so simple for female athletes to openly acknowledge just how great they are, but the superlative American is finally doing so with a newfound outspokennessIf you’re the greatest gymnast of all time, you should dress like it.When Simone Biles took to the floor for podium training ahead of this weekend’s US national gymnastics championships at Kansas City’s Spirit Center, she was wearing a leotard that more than hinted at her GOAT status. It was grey and white with iridescent flourishes, same as her World Champions Centre teammates, while the back was all Biles. Her surname was embroidered in crystals and underneath was a crystal embroidered head of a goat.The GOAT wearing a goat. A bit on the nose but facts are facts. Simone Biles is the greatest gymnast of all-time. We – gymnasts, coaches, fans, the media – have been saying it for years so why shouldn’t she acknowledge it?At the 2018 US championships in Boston, Biles and Sam Mikulak won their fifth US women’s and men’s all-around titles, respectively. Biles went on to win her fourth world all-around title, as well as the vault and floor gold, uneven bars silver and balance beam bronze medals. Biles also anchored the US women’s team that won the team title.It’s not always so simple for female athletes to openly acknowledge just how great they are. Take what happened to the US women’s national team at this summer’s World Cup. Their exuberance at scoring goals against a weaker opponent was roundly criticized, with some suggesting that the US women should have backed down in the 13-0 rout of Thailand in their opening match of the tournament.If displays of confidence, bravado even, from female athletes was in any way normalized and embraced, the celebrations from the US women’s national team at the World Cup wouldn’t have made headlines and be viewed as almost an international incident. As many noted, had the players been men instead of women, their on-field celebrations would have hardly registered, much less become fodder for a million takes.Though Biles has never defeated a gymnast by 13 points, she does win by margins that are unusually large for gymnastics. (Her margin of victory at last year’s worlds was the biggest ever despite two falls and a kidney stone.) And like the USWNT, she shows no sign of backing off. Biles keeps adding new and more difficult skills to her routines even though her Rio routines, with some minor adjustments for the changes in the Code of Points since the last Olympics, would still be enough to defeat the current generation of gymnasts. At the podium training session, wearing that GOAT leotard, Biles showed off two outlandishly difficult skills that, if performed in international competition, will be named for her. The first was a triple twisting double somersault on floor exercise, which only a very few male gymnasts can perform and Biles’ is arguably better than most of them.And then she went to the balance beam. At the end of her exercise she paused for what felt like a minute before launching into her dismount series of two back handsprings into a double twisting double somersault.This is a skill that gymnastics have seen Biles do before. In a video that was posted to YouTube in 2013, Biles did the same dismount series she showed during podium training on Wednesday onto a soft landing surface. Not long after asked Aimee Boorman, her former coach, about this and other skills I had seen her mess around with and she characterized them as play, as a way of breaking up the monotony of training. In the run-up to Rio, Biles wasn’t making significant upgrades to her routine. The plan back then was to hold steady, keep Biles injury-free and get her through the unfathomable pressure she was about to face at her first Games.But Biles is not playing around anymore. Now that she’s won everything there is to win – and many of those things more than once – Biles is pushing the technical boundaries of the sport and amazing herself in the process.Amazement is how Biles characterized her reaction to her own abilities and performance after last month’s US Classic, which she, of course, won. Afterward she was asked in the post-meet interview by NBC’s Tim Daggett how much better she could actually get. Biles didn’t give the quantitative answer that the question demanded, a unit of measurement for “better” rather, she offered us a glimpse into her mindset, which is that of a supremely confident female athlete. “I feel like every day in training I amaze myself even more so we’ll have to see what’s to come,” she said of the new, staggeringly difficult skills she performs with seeming ease.Every day in practice is a little revelation for Biles. She’s discovering just how good she is and, most importantly, she’s telling us. There’s no hiding behind an “I just hope to do my best” persona. When I interviewed her back in early 2016, she would say things like, “If I make the Olympic team” even though her inclusion on the team was never in doubt if she remained healthy. I don’t think her statements were disingenuous I just don’t think she was ready to fully own just how good she is.The increased confidence has lead to an outspokenness and, at times, a willingness to be vulnerable. Biles, who came forward last year as a survivor of sexual abuse by Larry Nassar, has openly criticized USA Gymnastics for their failures in protecting and caring for the athletes. Her tweets have led to the closing of the Karolyi Ranch, the place where many of the gymnasts were abused, and played a role in the resignation of very short-lived USA Gymnastics president Mary Bono.Addressing the media after the training session was over, Biles, her voice breaking, spoke about how hard it is for her to come to Kansas City to compete for an organization that had failed her and so many others. Last week, a new Congressional report was released that charged that multiple institutions, including the USA Gymnastics, Michigan State, the US Olympic Committee, and the FBI had opportunities to stop Nassar and did not.“We’ve done everything that they’ve asked us for, even when we didn’t want to and they couldn’t do one damn job,” she said. “You had one job. You literally had one job and you couldn’t protect us.”Biles is often spoken about in superhero terms, with the focus on her tremendous athletic ability, and doesn’t get nearly enough credit for her mental discipline. To be able to perform incredible athletic feats is one thing to be able to do them under pressure, year after year, and hit as consistently as she has, is as impressive a feat as the double double she showcased off the beam. To do it all while grappling with the trauma of sexual abuse, and competing for the very same federation that enabled your abuse, is another level of difficulty entirely – one the judges can’t factor into your difficulty score. It is, to borrow from her own words, simply amazing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab04a4e69d4723d9ae0194a3b65bf2a85a60aa2/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feb73a5aa722765580601191ddcfd7c5","title":"uber quarterly earnings loss stocks shares","story":"Second earnings report shows worse-than-predicted losses and revenue growthThe company was reporting earnings for only the second time following its share sale in May.

A spokesperson for Peru’s ministry of culture said it would reply by 25 August, the date set by Unesco to receive an official response.It is not the first time Unesco has sent Peru a warning about Machu Picchu. It threatened to place the famous ruins on a list of world heritage sites in danger in 2017 over fears overcrowding could damage the structure.As a result Peruvian authorities put controls on the flow of tourists – an average of 5,000 a day in summer, more than double the Unesco-recommended limit – by iding visits to the site into morning and afternoon shifts. Around 1.5m tourists visited Machu Picchu in 2017 and visitor numbers continue to increase. The Peruvian government hopes a second airport for Cusco, with direct flights from Miami and Buenos Aires, could nearly double the number of tourists.The Peruvian president, Martín Vizcarra, has vowed that the airport, set for completion in 2023, must go ahead. He used his recent Peruvian independence day speech to allay fears that the construction would affect the “archaeological, natural, historical and cultural legacy of Cusco”. On a visit to the site this week, Peru’s transport minister, María Jara, said “nothing would stop” the airport’s construction.While tour operators and hoteliers mostly agree that Cusco, Peru’s principal tourist destination, needs a second airport, there is debate about whether the 600-year-old Inca site of Chinchero is the best location for it. Juan Stoessel, general manager of the Casa Andina hotel chain, argues the chosen location would allow planes to land and take off from both sides of the runway – unlike the alternative sites in the mountain region – making it a hub for flights from the main cities in the region.“Cusco receives around 3.5m tourists a year, which is a very low number compared with other world-class tourist destinations,” said Stoessel, adding that nearby archeological sites such as Ollantaytambo, Choquequirao and Vilcabamba needed better management.But Marisol Mosquera, founder and CEO of Aracari Travel, said: “It breaks my heart to see one of the most monumental and gorgeous landscapes in the Andes being defaced in the name of ‘progress’. Our goal was to promote sustainable, low-impact, high-quality tourism. Now the destination is being destroyed.”A spokesperson for Unesco Peru said it could not comment as matters relating to world heritage sites were dealt with by the body’s Paris headquarters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31656bce5e4ae63d0c456c79855a11770706a036/0_253_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a17d2b4082ef294f6282a4bdbce15403","title":"chinas child modelling industry a photo essay","story":"Manicured children strut down the catwalks of Beijing fashion shows as thousands of events drive the huge demand for child models. Insiders warn that modelling can leave minors vulnerable to physical abuse, 12-hour-days and unrelenting pressureby Greg BakerAFPGetty Images. Co-written by Xin Liu and Pak YiuThe children’s apparel market is growing faster than any other clothing sector in China and was worth more than $40.5bn (£33bn) in 2018, according to Euromonitor. This, combined with the rise of “kidfluencers” sponsored by brands to promote products on social media, is spurring greater demand for young models across the country – but experts warn of the heavy cost of pursuing such deals.“If children don’t listen to the parents, then I think hitting them is quite standard,” Lee Ku, the founder of Le Show Stars modelling school, told AFP. A video of a mother kicking her three-year-old daughter in fury at her failure to comply during a modelling job went viral earlier this year, causing outrage online. And footage emerged in early August online of a young boy modelling thick winter clothes outside as temperatures soared to 37C, also drawing heavy online criticism.But in an industry where minors can earn 10,000 yuan (£1,200) a session, Lee says the clip is the tip of the iceberg and, from his experience, such violent behaviour from parents is not unusual on shoots. Child models sometimes go through more than 100 outfit changes in a session, often working from morning till night. But mental health experts warn it is not just physical exhaustion they have to contend with – there may be long-term emotional implications.“Children from the age of zero to six are mentally developing, they need a lot of exploration and freedom,” explained child psychologist Gong Xueping. “At work, the child model will deliberately show a lot of different expressions ... but this is contrary to the child’s own feelings of the moment. This limits the development of both emotional abilities and more complex psychological abilities for children, so I think it’s a very bad choice,” Gong added.But there remains no shortage of parents interested in pushing their children into the profession. Founded three years ago, Le Show Stars was one of the first modelling schools in Beijing, where customers pay up to £95 for a private one-on-one lesson.Four-year-old twins Yumi and Yuki Xiao are not yet professional models, but for nearly two years they have been taking classes teaching them how to pose and pace the catwalk, in the hopes that they can break into the industry.“For some catwalking competitions, they have to be in the makeup room by 6am,” their father, Xiao Liang, said. “The real competition starts at 2pm, and they finish around 3pm or 4. So the whole thing takes a whole day. From 6am to 6pm – 12 hours is pretty standard.” Their parents invest in taking them around the country to compete in hundreds of national child modelling competitions.“It’s a lot of fun, I like being on stage,” insisted Yumi.Like many other parents, Xiao says he initially enrolled the two in child modelling to build their self-confidence, but after Yumi and Yuki showed interest they started to invest more time and money into building a possible child modelling career path for them. Occasionally the twins are paid to model seasonal fashion lines for big brands. “I think they are one of a kind – firstly, they’re twins, and they’re also boy-girl twins,” Xiao says. “They also like it, which is why we are giving them this opportunity. I think they have a natural advantage over other kids,” he added.China’s child labour laws are complicated and parents of underage models are sometimes paid in secret to sidestep the red tape required to employ them. Responding to the kicking video, the authorities in Hangzhou, where the incident took place, introduced regulations to limit the hours children work and ban children under 10 from being brand spokespeople. But many feel that authorities are doing too little to protect children from exploitation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e450f4ad20c05b76a7a60c7f6b9241332889ff4d/0_122_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98d7833b1672af5af5bd9a9e626d71c3","title":"italys matteo salvini calls for fresh elections as coalition fractures","story":"Far-right leader says it is pointless continuing government with Five Star Movement Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of the far-right League party, has called for a snap election, urging the prime minister to reconvene parliament to confirm that the coalition government is no longer viable.The dramatic move on Thursday came after months of fighting between the League and its coalition partners, the anti-establishement Five Star Movement (M5S).The cavernous differences between the parties were clearly exposed on Wednesday when parliament rejected a motion by M5S to block a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France. M5S has built most of its popularity on vehemently opposing the long-stalled project but was outvoted by the League and opposition parties.In a statement, Salvini, who is also Italy’s interior minister, said it was pointless continuing the government with all the quarrelling.“Italians need certainty and a government that does things, not a ‘Mr No’,” he said.“We do not want extra seats or ministers, nor do we want reshuffles or technical governments. After this government (which has done so many good things), the only thing is elections.”Conte, who had held separate talks with Salvini and the country’s President Sergio Mattarella as the crisis deepened, said in a statement later that the interior minister doesn’t summon parliament and “it’s not up to him to dictate the steps of the political crisis.”Conte called on Salvini “to explain to the country and justify to the electorate, who believed in the possibility of change, the reasons that brought him to abruptly interrupt” the activities of government.Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader and co-deputy prime minister, said he was ready to return to the polls as “the League has mocked Italians”.The uneasy partnership between the far-right League and the anti-establishment M5S has been rocked by ongoing spats. The coalition came to power in June 2018 but the government has been on shaky ground for much of the time, with constant speculation that Salvini would orchestrate a collapse in order to take advantage of his high poll ratings.Salvini, who is almost always in campaign mode, began a two-week trip around the country’s beaches on Wednesday in attempt to whip up more support. Sabaudia, a beach town close to Rome, was the first stop on the trip, which will also take in the central regions of Abruzzo and Molise, before heading south to Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily and Campania.The Italian parliament is now on its summer break but it could reconvene next week. The government won’t move towards a collapse unless there’s a no-confidence motion or Conte resigns. It then rests with Mattarella to dissolve the government and decide if the next step would be snap elections or the installation of a technical government in order to pass the 2020 budget in the autumn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d805fd42405cbda5cf1c3668695aab30abf3738d/0_176_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47164a981abd2ec768895e2ef3456bc7","title":"vladimir putin 20 years in power in pictures","story":"Twenty years ago the Russian president Boris Yeltsin appointed his fourth prime minister in less than 18 months: Vladimir Putin, then a relatively unknown security services chief with scant experience of politics.

Photograph: David MoirReutersThe world cannot avoid the worst impacts of climate change without radically changing how it produces food, the UN has warned in its latest assessment on the accelerating impact of global heating on the planet.The findings of leading scientists who make up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), places additional pressures on the Government to re-direct agricultural policy, to ersify the sector and to reduce reliance on beef and dairying. Ending peat extraction from boglands is also endorsed in the report issued in Geneva on Thursday. The IPCC concluded that eating less meat, especially in developed countries, and reducing food waste was an effective method to help reduce global warming. It predicts that taking this course would save millions of square kilometres of land from being degraded by farming.The findings led to calls on the Government from climate campaigners and the Green Party to draw up a national land-use plan to help redirect agriculture and to set out how afforestation could help reduce carbon emissions.Climatologist Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University, who is a leading IPCC author, said the report underlines the huge vulnerability facing the country due to reliance on beef and dairying.The IPCC had demonstrated climate and land degradation were entwined risks, he added. “If we want to reduce risk to land we need to get serious about addressing climate change,” he warned.DietsEverybody needs to think carefully about their diets, he said. The evidence was overwhelming that meat-rich diets placed greater stress on land and had a higher carbon footprint. “We need to actively promote less intensive agricultural production.”About 25 per cent of food globally was wasted, he noted, “yet hundreds of millions are malnourished . . . We do need a serious assessment of how we can do better”. He was not calling for getting rid of all cattle. “But we need to take a number of actions which makes sense irrespective of climate change. We are one disease outbreak or shift in consumer habits from decimating rural Ireland economy.” There was a need to reduce the national herd and to ersify production “so we produce locally more of the food we nationally need to consume”. A national land-use plan was key to effectively managing land in a changing climate, he said.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said the report was a timely scientific assessment of the current state of knowledge on climate change and land.

Photograph: Martial TrezziniEPAThe latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was broadly welcomed by scientists across the globe as a framework to transform land use and increase food security.Although the report stopped short of explicitly advocating going meat-free, it calls for big changes to farming and eating habits to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on already over-exploited land and water resources.“This is a perfect storm,” said Prof Dave Reay of the University of Edinburgh, who was an expert reviewer for the report. “Limited land, an expanding human population, and all wrapped in a suffocating blanket of climate emergency. Earth has never felt smaller, its natural ecosystems never under such direct threat.”Dr Oyinlola Oyebode, associate professor in public health at the University of Warwick, said the IPCC verdict fits with growing evidence of the multiple benefits that could accrue if people shift their diet towards plant-based alternatives to meat.These benefits included reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and releasing land which could then be reclaimed as habitat for animal and plant species.“In addition, though, there are benefits to human health.”Wake-up callJonathan Baillie, chief scientist for the National Geographic Society, said the IPCC report was another important wake-up call to find a more sustainable path.“This is a global problem, which requires action by all sectors of society – countries, companies and communities – to solve.”Oxfam’s senior climate policy advisor Aditi Sen said land management was central to the fight against the climate crisis and hunger. Industrial agriculture, deforestation and increasing weather shocks were destroying the land needed for food, while the world’s poorest were hit hardest.“Politicians must aim for zero hunger as well as zero emissions. They must reject false solutions that ert land away from growing food and into producing crops and trees for energy and carbon capture.”IPCC representative Prof Jim Skea of Imperial College London said land was already struggling and climate change was adding to its burden. Almost three-quarters of ice-free land was now directly affected by human activity, the report says.‘Less pressure’“There are certain kinds of diets that have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land,” he said.Large-scale tree-planting and bioenergy production are important tools to limit global warming, but could threaten food security, according to the IPCC. In late-running negotiations on how to summarise the latest science for policymakers, representatives of forest nations stressed that with sustainable management, these conflicts could be minimised.“Land already in use could feed the world in a changing climate and provide biomass for renewable energy, but early, far-reaching action across several areas is required,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, one of the other scientists coordinating the report. “Also for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and bioersity.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3981097.1565292152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"consultant who carried out research on women without consent put on leave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast June, Prof Ray O’Sullivan told The  he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on the vaginas of five women patients. Photograph: ThinkstockA consultant at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, who carried out research on five women patients without their consent, has been placed on administrative leave.Obstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan has told colleagues he plans to vigorously challenge the decision by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to place him on leave, effective from last Wednesday.Prof O’Sullivan will remain on leave, on full pay, while his case is dealt with under the HSE’s disciplinary procedures. The decision to place him on leave was made by HSE director general Paul Reid. Last June, Prof O’Sullivan told The  he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on the vaginas of five women patients last September. The tests were stopped after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from the hospital and from the patients.The hospital sought his suspension, prompting Ireland East Hospital Group to commission a report into the issue, which found no evidence of informed consent having been sought from the women.Two reportsThe hospital group then commissioned a second report, but after The  revealed what had happened, Mr Reid assumed responsibility for dealing with the issue. As a consultant with a pre-2008 contract, Prof O’Sullivan is legally employed and responsible to the chief executive of the (now defunct) health board.Mr Reid wrote to Prof O’Sullivan last month enclosing the two reports and a summary of the incident, and seeking a response by July 31st. Prof O’Sullivan replied by letter, after which Mr Reid sent a second letter earlier this week placing him on administrative leave with immediate effect.Contacted on Thursday, Prof O’Sullivan declined to comment, saying the matter was with his legal advisers and would be “sorted out” by them. A spokeswoman for the hospital group said: “The Ireland East Hospital Group and HSE are precluded from discussing issues between employers and employees. Therefore we have no comment at this time.”‘Pressure study’The procedure performed on the five women involved flushing their vaginas with water and testing the resultant changes in pressure. Prof O’Sullivan is trying to develop a technique that could reduce or replace the need for a speculum, the traditional tool used by gynaecologists to open the vagina for examination.The patients, who were in hospital for a hysteroscopy (examination of the vagina with a miniature camera), were unaware of the research work being carried out by Prof O’Sullivan. This involved a rectal probe, sourced from outside the hospital, being inserted into the vagina. This was connected to a monitoring kit which was used to measure vaginal pressures.Prof O’Sullivan, in correspondence with the hospital group, has described the research as a “pressure study” using sterile water and has said the transducers on the equipment were changed between patients on the insistence of nursing staff.“I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research.

Of those arrested more than 100 were released within 48 hours.Most unionists supported the move at the time although the Rev Ian Paisley opposed it because he was concerned some loyalists would be interned.Internees were held at the new Long Kesh camp near Lisburn, later known as the Maze Prison, Magilligan British army camp in Co Derry and on the Maidstone ship in Belfast Harbour.Internment prompted serious violence. Over August 9th and 10th 23 people died including the ten people who died in the Ballymurphy Massacre in west Belfast.The swoops caused huge Catholic and nationalist alienation from the unionist state and also served as a recruitment boon for the IRA, just as Bloody Sunday did six months later in Derry.Internment ramped up the Troubles. It is estimated that from August 9th, 1971 until the end of that year that close to 150 people were killed, with many hundreds injured. The following year almost 500 people were killed, the worst year of the Troubles.Fourteen of those arrested, the so-called Hooded Men, were subjected to what was euphemistically named “interrogation in depth”.This involved the so-called five techniques: wall-standing, hooding, subjection to white noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink. It was further alleged that some of the men were made to believe they were being ejected from helicopters from hundreds of feet in the air when in fact they were thrown to the ground from a relatively short distance.The Irish Government took a case to Europe on behalf of the 14 men. The European Court on Human Rights found the five interrogation methods amounted to torture. That judgment was appealed by the British government to the European Court of Human Rights which slightly moderated the judgment to say the men were subjected to “inhuman and degrading treatment”.As a result of the violence following from internment the Irish Government set up five camps to accommodate families of internees and refugees from the Trouble.Almost 2,000 people were interned up until its ending in December 1975. it is estimated that just over 100 were loyalists, with the first loyalists interned early in 1973.The annual commemorations of the introduction of internment, which included the tradition of bonfires, regularly led to serious violence and disorder in Northern Ireland. In 1988 Sinn Féin was involved in establishing the annual and successful West Belfast Féile an Pobail to try to steer people away from such violence."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Brexit latest news: Michael Gove discusses November 1 bank holiday to mitigate no-deal fallout   US calls China \u0026#39thuggish regime\u0026#39 for targeting diplomat in Hong KongCycle cafe locked in row with council after it bans cycling clubs from stopping thereHong Kong protesters stage airport rally to win support from visitors as countries issue travel warningsThe rise of anti-Semitism in Europe: \u0026#39He sang Nazi songs and said Hitler should have finished the job\u0026#39Donald Trump vs Vladimir Putin: Who will win the new space race?10-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl sets 7,000m mountain record and aims for EverestUK weather: Heavy rain and wind warnings to bring transport chaos across countryDelaying Brexit again is more damaging than a no-deal on October 31, says Tory party deputy chairman Comment: A world-class education system is well within Britain’s graspTrump names counterterrorism chief as acting director of national intelligenceMcConnell rejects US mayors\u0026#39 demand for Senate action on gun bills, after shootingsLabour MSPs vow to ignore John McDonnell U-turn over allowing second independence referendumMillions suffering mobile phone signal blackouts because most areas lack 4G coverageAsthma deaths have increased by a third in a decade as hot summers, air pollution and lack of care blamed Teenage girl, 14, found dead and relative in critical condition after Clacton sea rescueDavid Mundell: \u0026#39Hard to push back\u0026#39 against second Scottish referendum if \u0026#39explicit\u0026#39 nationalist majority in 2021Boris Johnson gets ready to turn on the spending taps as he refuses to rule out Nov 1 electionChemistry undergraduate becomes twelfth student in Bristol to take their own lifeAssistant chief constable smashed into oncoming car because she was trying to make hands free call to MP husband, court hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio inside fortnite world cup future fast food","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Following the new Prime Minister\u0027s visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Philip Johnston writes that a radical new plan might be required to keep the Union together.Kyle Giersdorf might not be a name many people know, but the 16-year-old gamer recently became £2.4m richer after becoming the Fortnite world champion.

The death of Maria Stancliffe-Cook, 20, an undergraduate at Bristol University, follows a spate of student fatalities in the city in recent years. This includes nine from Bristol University and a further two from the neighbouring University of the West of England.In a statement her family described her as a beautiful and intelligent girl.They said: Maria was a beautiful, intelligent girl who was much loved and will be deeply missed by her family and friends. She was a hard working and diligent student. Words cannot express how saddened we are by her unexpected absence from our lives.Earlier this month it emerged that Bristol University used new powers to alert the parents of 36 students that there were serious concerns about their mental health in the first year of its new suicide prevention scheme.The reasons for Miss Stancliffe-Cook\u0027s death are not yet known. A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “We have received the very sad news that Maria Stancliffe-Cook, an undergraduate student studying Chemistry at the University of Bristol, has died.  “There is nothing harder for our community than the death of one of our students. We have offered our support to Maria’s family and friends, and our thoughts and sympathies are with them all.   “We encourage any members of our community who are affected by this news to make sure they contact University wellbeing services for help, even if they are away from Bristol for the summer holidays, as well as seeking support from their own friends or family.”Numbers to callBristol University is currently spending £1 million on well-being advisers as part of a package to counter growing concerns over students\u0027 mental health.   The university has hired a team of 28 full-time mental health advisers and managers who will be embedded in academic departments and cater for the welfare needs of students.It carried out a review of its support for mental health issues in response to the increasing numbers of students who struggle with anxiety, depression or other conditions.They also have daily drop-in sessions with a well-being team where students are given lifestyle advice and exercise programmes or referred for counselling. University of BristolUniversity of the West of EnglandModi says Kashmir decision will rid region of \u0026#39terrorism and separatism\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Michael Gove discusses November 1 bank holiday to mitigate no-deal fallout   US calls China \u0026#39thuggish regime\u0026#39 for targeting diplomat in Hong KongCycle cafe locked in row with council after it bans cycling clubs from stopping thereHong Kong protesters stage airport rally to win support from visitors as countries issue travel warningsThe rise of anti-Semitism in Europe: \u0026#39He sang Nazi songs and said Hitler should have finished the job\u0026#39Donald Trump vs Vladimir Putin: Who will win the new space race?10-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl sets 7,000m mountain record and aims for EverestUK weather: Heavy rain and wind warnings to bring transport chaos across countryDelaying Brexit again is more damaging than a no-deal on October 31, says Tory party deputy chairman Comment: A world-class education system is well within Britain’s graspTrump names counterterrorism chief as acting director of national intelligenceMcConnell rejects US mayors\u0026#39 demand for Senate action on gun bills, after shootingsLabour MSPs vow to ignore John McDonnell U-turn over allowing second independence referendumMillions suffering mobile phone signal blackouts because most areas lack 4G coverageAsthma deaths have increased by a third in a decade as hot summers, air pollution and lack of care blamed Teenage girl, 14, found dead and relative in critical condition after Clacton sea rescueDavid Mundell: \u0026#39Hard to push back\u0026#39 against second Scottish referendum if \u0026#39explicit\u0026#39 nationalist majority in 2021Boris Johnson gets ready to turn on the spending taps as he refuses to rule out Nov 1 electionAssistant chief constable smashed into oncoming car because she was trying to make hands free call to MP husband, court hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/08/TELEMMGLPICT000205934962_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW9bHRxFPq0tVjZCxsP_wwdUhrn5O8ghlqPrrwTXsSMs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"norwich cathedral accused treating god like tourist attraction","story":"Guests are able to climb the funfair ride and have the chance to see centuries-old architectural features and roof bosses.Social and Religious Affairs EditorThey may be renowned for their architectural majesty, historic significance and - at a push - their niche gift shop offerings. Yet in recent years the trend for opening up cathedrals to the public by advertising novelty attractions  - with everything from an installation of the moon to hosting skate festivals - has sparked furious debate.Now Norwich Cathedral is the latest religious building to be accused of “treating God like a tourist attraction”, after it installed a 55-ft helter skelter in its nave. Reverend Canon Andy Bryant, the Cathedral’s Canon for Mission and Pastoral Care, said the idea came to him when he was visiting the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Italy.“The fun comes in the shape of a helter skelter,” he said. “The serious comes in creating opportunities for reflective, God-shaped conversations. It is playful in its intent but also profoundly missional. “It is the Cathedral doing what it has always done – encouraging conversations about God. By its sheer size and grandeur it speaks of the things of God it points beyond itself. Its sheer presence helps to keep the rumour of God alive and plays its part in passing on the story of Salvation.”Visitors to Church of England cathedralsFor just £2 a ride, visitors will be able to enjoy a closer look at the medieval roof bosses or carvings which depict Biblical stories from the 40ft viewing platform.The ride is part of the Cathedral’s ‘Seeing It Differently’ campaign, which was devised by Rev Bryant, with the aim of giving people the opportunity to experience the building “in an entirely new way and open up conversations about faith”.However  the Right Reverend Dr Gavin Ashenden, former chaplain to the Queen, has criticised the Cathedral for making a “mockery” of God. “Instead of allowing a Cathedral to act as a bridge between people and God’s presence, instead it obscures it by offering to entertain and ert people,” he told The .The Dean of Norwich, the Very Revd Jane Hedges and choristers from the boys and girls choir at the launch of the 55ft Helter Skelter “There’s a sliding scale between mockery and blasphemy. It’s a mockery because it’s treating God like a tourist attraction, instead of as the creator of the universe who is going to hold us accountable for our ethical failures. “It becomes blasphemy at the point where the cathedrals represent a long line of belief - much of which is martyred belief - people have paid with their lives to believe in Christ and cathedral is corporeal embodiment of Christ.” “To turn this into entertainment,” he added, “is blasphemous to Christ and the people who died for Christ. It suggests cathedrals have lost their responsibility to Christ because they are preoccupied with the demands of society.”The ride has also drawn criticism from Christians and humanists alike. One Twitter user wrote: “Yeah, I’m seeing it as desecration and mockery (and I’m not even Christian).”  Another added: “We need to bring back the Inquisition to England.”Some took it even more seriously, with one user tweeting the ominous message: “One day, God will punish you for this.”The ride is the latest ‘stunt’ to grace holy buildings. Last month Rochester Cathedral opened a crazy golf course in its nave, allowing visitors to putt their way round the 11th-century building. In the past visitors have also skated in the aisles at Gloucester and gazed at the moon in LiverpoolReverend Canon Andy Bryant, of Nowich Cathedral said the idea came to him when he was visiting the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Italy. Many Cathedrals face financial struggles however congregations have risen by about 10 per cent in a decade, with a total weekly attendance of 37,000 people.The Archbishop of Canterbury even told a cathedrals conference last year: The first thing I want is for people not to be bored. I want them to have fun ... If you can\u0027t have fun in a cathedral, you don\u0027t know what fun is.Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at the University of Oxford, has also taken a more lighthearted view of the ride. “There’s mini golf in Rochester Cathedral now,” he said. “I took a relaxed view of it. The helter skelter is in the west of the nave - the space within medieval cathedrals which you might not call the holiest part of the building. It was often the area used for leisure purposes in the Middle Ages, so I don’t really see this as a desecration, although I can imagine the sort of people who would.”Professor MacCulloch added that some would think the ride a “trendy”, “dangerous” or “undignified” installation erected in a bid to entice people through the doors of religious buildings as society becomes increasingly secularised.Rochester cathedral  opened a crazy golf course in its naveHowever he added: “But Cathedrals don\u0027t have any problem at all getting people in through the doors, so this shouldn’t be seen as a desperate attempt to get people in the building. “I’m not sure I would have done it,” he said, “but its worth seeing what it does.”  The funfair ride has a viewing platform at 40ft which will allow the riders have a unique experience when embracing the cathedral\u0027s 69ft-high roof. It costs £2 per ride, with funds covering the cost of hire from a funfair company and any surplus going into cathedral initiatives.Adrian Dorber, chair of the Association of English Cathedrals, said that “creative innovation is part of our mission”. “There is a cathedral shaped space out there and we hope we are occupying it in bold, fresh and exciting ways that welcome people, that challenge, that engage with our communities and reach new audiences and that say something about cathedrals being a place for all, while ensuring our buildings will be there for our future generations.”Modi says Kashmir decision will rid region of \u0026#39terrorism and separatism\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Michael Gove discusses November 1 bank holiday to mitigate no-deal fallout   US calls China \u0026#39thuggish regime\u0026#39 for targeting diplomat in Hong KongCycle cafe locked in row with council after it bans cycling clubs from stopping thereHong Kong protesters stage airport rally to win support from visitors as countries issue travel warningsThe rise of anti-Semitism in Europe: \u0026#39He sang Nazi songs and said Hitler should have finished the job\u0026#39Donald Trump vs Vladimir Putin: Who will win the new space race?10-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl sets 7,000m mountain record and aims for EverestUK weather: Heavy rain and wind warnings to bring transport chaos across countryDelaying Brexit again is more damaging than a no-deal on October 31, says Tory party deputy chairman Comment: A world-class education system is well within Britain’s graspTrump names counterterrorism chief as acting director of national intelligenceMcConnell rejects US mayors\u0026#39 demand for Senate action on gun bills, after shootingsLabour MSPs vow to ignore John McDonnell U-turn over allowing second independence referendumMillions suffering mobile phone signal blackouts because most areas lack 4G coverageAsthma deaths have increased by a third in a decade as hot summers, air pollution and lack of care blamed Teenage girl, 14, found dead and relative in critical condition after Clacton sea rescueDavid Mundell: \u0026#39Hard to push back\u0026#39 against second Scottish referendum if \u0026#39explicit\u0026#39 nationalist majority in 2021Boris Johnson gets ready to turn on the spending taps as he refuses to rule out Nov 1 electionChemistry undergraduate becomes twelfth student in Bristol to take their own lifeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/07/TELEMMGLPICT000205826274_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqE9mcTSRfiEZmiVdmYwO8CC4pGy3HLfiyAwf_XN0ms1I.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"10 year old pakistani schoolgirl sets 7000m mountain record","story":"10-year-old Selena Khawaja reached the 7,027m summit of Spantik in July 2019A 10-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl has claimed a world record for being the youngest ever person to scale a 7,000m peak and now intends to climb Mount Everest.Selena Khawaja\u0027s conquest of 7,027m (23,054ft) Spantik in the Karakoram range last month comes only two-and-a-half years after she first started leisurely walks in the mountains with her father.Her climbing exploits have seen her nicknamed \u0027Mountain Princess\u0027 in Pakistan\u0027s media. Driven on by her father as expedition companion, she now intends to become the youngest person ever to climb to the roof of the world.Her young age means she has more than two-and-a-half years left to beat the current Everest record, but aims to make an attempt next summer if she can get funding.“I like the views better than anything,” Selena explained to the  at her home in Abbottabad, in Pakistan\u0027s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Selena trains in her father\u0026#39s Abbottabad gymHer July ascent of Spantik, also known as Golden Peak, has been verified by the Alpine Club of Pakistan. “We are meeting soon for her certification process,” said spokesman Karrar Haidri.The climb was also praised by Pakistan\u0027s government. “Selena Khawaja has made Pakistan proud by scaling Spantik peak”, a statement said.Selena and her father, Yousaf, began hiking up the nearby mountain of Miranjani for fun in 2017 and he quickly noticed that she was getting faster with every trip up the 2,992m peak.Mr Khawaja, a 59-year-old fitness instructor and nutritionist, said: “My plan was to get her into some kind of sport, but I didn\u0027t know which. When we used to go to trips up Miranjani, I realised in six months she had halved her time.”Selena and her father YousafPakistan sees the confluence of the Hindu Kush, Himalya and Karakoram ranges and is a haven for mountaineers. Selena has since worked her way up 5,000m and 6,000m mountains.Mr Khawaja went on: “She is very good at climbing. At some points she is faster and at other times I am faster. At some points she tells me \u0027Papa slow down a little bit!\u0027 and I say to her \u0027In a year you will be saying Papa speed up!\u0027”As well as training in the picturesque mountains around Abottabad, Selena also works out in the gym and fitness centre her father runs.Mr Khawaja admits that at first Selena\u0027s mother was anxious about the climbing and whether her daughter was too young. But he said their success had won her over.Guinness World Records said it did not monitor a record for the youngest person to climb a 7,000m peak and only held endurance records for those aged 16 and above. A spokeswoman said: “Therefore, at 10 years old, Selena would be below the minimum age threshold for a record of this nature. Nevertheless, her achievement is very impressive.”The youngest conquest of Everest was carried out by 13-year-old Californian Jordan Romero in 2010. His ascent triggered a debate about whether children should be exposed to the rigours of high altitude climbing, with some medics calling it child abuse.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

scene that would have seen the villain – played by Josh Broline –\u0026nbspsat on a throne comprised of skulls.He revealed that the gruesome moment “ended up in a set of pages at one point in the script” and that concept art of the moment may be in existence.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can be damaging, not only to the share price, but also to investor confidence.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspSome better news today in stock markets that have suffered recently from fears surrounding an escalating trade war between the US\u0026nbspand China.\u0026nbspThe major indices edged up on the back of\u0026nbspsurprise news that Chinese exports rose 3.3 per cent in July, despite rising tariffs imposed by Donald Trump\u0027s administration.\u0026nbspImports were also up suggesting China is showing signs of resilience.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Japan\u0027s Nikkei 225 up 0.37 per cent to 20,593.35.\u0026nbsp- Hong Kong\u0027s Hang Seng up 0.5 per cent to 26,120.77\u0026nbsp- Germany\u0027s Dax up 0.5 per cent to 11,712.12\u0026nbsp- France\u0027s CAC 40 up 1 per cent to 5,317.74\u0026nbsp- FTSE 100 up 0.14 per cent to 7,208.62While interest rates and economic data would normally drive the value of the pound, right now the primary factor by a long distance is the perceived probability that the UK will leave the EU with no deal on 31 October.\u0026nbspThe more likely it appears to be, the lower the pound goes.\u0026nbspThis morning brings news of another plan MPs have hatched to prevent that outcome, which a majority of them - and the public - want to avoid.\u0026nbspMPs are considering a bid to cancel the annual autumn recess set aside for party conferences in a fresh attempt to prevent Boris Johnson ploughing ahead with a no-deal Brexit, our political correspondent Ashley Cowburn reports.\u0026nbspBrexit: MPs considering bid to ‘cancel autumn recess’ to stop Halloween no-dealBrexit has put some people off buying or selling a home, says upmarket estate agent Savills, which reported results today.\u0026nbspSales of UK property are at the lowest level since the financial crisis while protests in Hong Kong also dented the market there, Savills says.\u0026nbspChief executive\u0026nbspMark Ridley: “In many markets, particularly the UK and Hong Kong, political and economic uncertainty has considerably reduced the volume of real estate trading activity in recent months, although occupier demand remains robust.\u0026nbspHalf-year pre-tax profits fell 12 per cent to £38.4m in the six months to 30 June.\u0026nbspA plummeting pound of course means reduced spending power\u0026nbspfor British holidaymakers heading away this month.\u0026nbspAs always, even the best rates for consumers are some way below the market rate.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt the best of the large foreign exchange providers, £750 will now buy you:\u0026nbspeuros:\u0026nbspDebenhams -

The balance of exporting manufacturers that have increased orders also fell to +9, down from +21 in the same quarter last year. In services it fell to +5 from +14.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersUncertainty has increased significantly since the April to June period as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has become more likely under Boris Johnson\u0027s government.The BCC warned that many businesses are not ready for the immediate and abrupt changes that a no-deal Brexit would bring.It urged the government to fast-track through paperwork that all UK businesses will need in order to trade with the EU after Brexit.A worryingly low number of firms have obtained an Economic Operators Registration and Idetification number\u0026nbsp(EORI) which is required for customs purposes, the BCC said.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the BCC, said:\u0026nbsp“There is real frustration among business communities across the UK at the lack of clarity about trading conditions after the UK leaves the EU, and we’re already seeing the impact of that uncertainty.“While the majority of firms want the government to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit, we’re calling on the government to put practicalities first and implement measures to ensure firms are as prepared as possible for the whatever scenario they face. A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal. While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong â wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we are forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year,” Javid said in a statement.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u0026nbspthat\u0027s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”The UK economy had been expected to flatline in the latest quarter but instead it contracted by 0.2 per cent as the impact of ongoing uncertainty around Brexit began to hit home.\u0026nbspThe economic contraction was driven by a plunge in manufacturing output, partly because car makers brought forward their annual shutdowns to April in anticipation of the previous 29\u0026nbspMarch Brexit deadline.Services provided the only positive contribution to GDP growth, although growth in the\u0026nbspsector slowed to a crawl, at 0.1 per cent compared with the first quarter.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsEconomists agree that the housing market will suffer if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), forecast last month that house prices would tumble by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021. The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there were two technologies that were notably absent from the Unpacked event.Neither Samsung\u0027s virtual assistant Bixby nor VR compatibility for the Note 10\u0026nbspreceived a single mention during the nearly two-hour tech\u0026nbspshowcase. Both have been heavily hyped in recent years, but their quiet omission\u0026nbspsuggests they may no longer be central to Samsung\u0027s grander ambitions.Bixby has not been forgotten entirely, with both the Note 10 and Note 10+ supporting the virtual assistant. But Samsung\u0027s answer to Apple\u0027s Siri and Amazon\u0027s Alexa was not called upon or showed off during any of the product demos.At the same venue in 2018, Samsung unveiled the Bixby-supported Galaxy Home, which was designed to offer an alternative to other smart speakers like the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home. Not only has the device failed to launch in the 12 months that have since elapsed, Samsung also failed to provide any update on the beleaguered speaker.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This can be damaging, not only to the share price, but also to investor confidence.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Where was he after Morgoth was defeated? Theoretically, Amazon can answer these questions by inventing the answers, since Tolkien did not describe it. But it must not contradict anything which Tolkien did say. That’s what Amazon has to watch out for. It must be canonical, it is impossible to change the boundaries which Tolkien has created, it is necessary to remain ‘tolkienian’.”Shippey also added that even the “First Age” of Middle Earth is “off-limits” to the new TV series as little of it was revealed by Tolkien himself, suggesting “it’s a bit of a minefield – you have to tread very carefully.”Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series is believed to be entering production in 2020, though the streaming site has yet to confirm an official release date.Lord of the Rings\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspSome better news today in stock markets that have suffered recently from fears surrounding an escalating trade war between the US\u0026nbspand China.\u0026nbspThe major indices edged up on the back of\u0026nbspsurprise news that Chinese exports rose 3.3 per cent in July, despite rising tariffs imposed by Donald Trump\u0027s administration.\u0026nbspImports were also up suggesting China is showing signs of resilience.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Japan\u0027s Nikkei 225 up 0.37 per cent to 20,593.35.\u0026nbsp- Hong Kong\u0027s Hang Seng up 0.5 per cent to 26,120.77\u0026nbsp- Germany\u0027s Dax up 0.5 per cent to 11,712.12\u0026nbsp- France\u0027s CAC 40 up 1 per cent to 5,317.74\u0026nbsp- FTSE 100 up 0.14 per cent to 7,208.62While interest rates and economic data would normally drive the value of the pound, right now the primary factor by a long distance is the perceived probability that the UK will leave the EU with no deal on 31 October.\u0026nbspThe more likely it appears to be, the lower the pound goes.\u0026nbspThis morning brings news of another plan MPs have hatched to prevent that outcome, which a majority of them - and the public - want to avoid.\u0026nbspMPs are considering a bid to cancel the annual autumn recess set aside for party conferences in a fresh attempt to prevent Boris Johnson ploughing ahead with a no-deal Brexit, our political correspondent Ashley Cowburn reports.\u0026nbspBrexit: MPs considering bid to ‘cancel autumn recess’ to stop Halloween no-dealBrexit has put some people off buying or selling a home, says upmarket estate agent Savills, which reported results today.\u0026nbspSales of UK property are at the lowest level since the financial crisis while protests in Hong Kong also dented the market there, Savills says.\u0026nbspChief executive\u0026nbspMark Ridley: “In many markets, particularly the UK and Hong Kong, political and economic uncertainty has considerably reduced the volume of real estate trading activity in recent months, although occupier demand remains robust.\u0026nbspHalf-year pre-tax profits fell 12 per cent to £38.4m in the six months to 30 June.\u0026nbspA plummeting pound of course means reduced spending power\u0026nbspfor British holidaymakers heading away this month.\u0026nbspAs always, even the best rates for consumers are some way below the market rate.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt the best of the large foreign exchange providers, £750 will now buy you:\u0026nbspeuros:\u0026nbspDebenhams -

The balance of exporting manufacturers that have increased orders also fell to +9, down from +21 in the same quarter last year. In services it fell to +5 from +14.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersUncertainty has increased significantly since the April to June period as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has become more likely under Boris Johnson\u0027s government.The BCC warned that many businesses are not ready for the immediate and abrupt changes that a no-deal Brexit would bring.It urged the government to fast-track through paperwork that all UK businesses will need in order to trade with the EU after Brexit.A worryingly low number of firms have obtained an Economic Operators Registration and Idetification number\u0026nbsp(EORI) which is required for customs purposes, the BCC said.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the BCC, said:\u0026nbsp“There is real frustration among business communities across the UK at the lack of clarity about trading conditions after the UK leaves the EU, and we’re already seeing the impact of that uncertainty.“While the majority of firms want the government to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit, we’re calling on the government to put practicalities first and implement measures to ensure firms are as prepared as possible for the whatever scenario they face. A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal. While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It occurs so that MPs can decamp the Commons chamber and travel to gatherings of party members across the country.\u0026nbspLeaders of all the main parties use the major event in the political calendar to set out their policy agenda and vision for the future, while thousands of activists gather in the conference halls.If MPs do decide to cancel the autumn recess, however, it is almost certain the conferences themselves will go ahead – not least due to them being a major source of income for the political parties.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A mosque is seen amongst residential housing from the air during a mass take off at the annual Bristol hot air balloon festival in BristolAn Asiatic lioness eats meat during feeding time ahead of World Lion Day at London ZooBeer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

The race will take place on 4 AugustAn extremely rare Pink Meanie jellyfish on display at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town. The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

When the excavators stop or left, we come close to the high walls and look for exposed erect lycopsid trunks.”The study’s authors acknowledged that it was difficult to mark and count all the trees without missing some details.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Five Star Movement campaigned against the project for years.Speaking to Italy’s national broadcaster Rai, the head of the Five Star Movement, 33-year-old Luigi Di Maio, accused Mr Salvini of putting party interests above national interest.But while he said that he isn’t worried about the possible new election and that his party is ready, some observers see the two parties’ reversed fortunes as the real reason for the crisis.The Five Star Movement was the big winner of the 2018 elections with almost 33 per cent of the votes but now polls at about 17 per cent, according to recent surveys.On the other hand, Salvini’s Lega had 17 per cent last year but now boasts about 38 per cent – a sign that investigations into Russian funding haven’t harmed Salvini’s ratings.The centre-left Democratic Party is polling at about 23 per cent.If the country does head to new polls in the coming months, the current parliamentary term would become the shortest in Italian republican history. The new government would be Italy’s 66th government in 74 years as a democracy.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I had to sleep at the bottom of their bed. I didn’t eat properly because I felt sick at the thought of everything that went on and was scared of him contacting me again.She adds: I dont feel safe when Deals out of prison... he could come out, go off the radar and try to hurt me - or worse, kill me. It’s happened before in other stalking cases so Im scared.Deals  past offences relate to other harassment and stalking incidents dating back to  - and Samantha fears more women could be targeted by the rapper when hes released.On one hand Im so happy hes away [again], but on the other hand Im like  weeks - really  He should get years after everything hes put me and the other girls through, she tells us.When he came out of prison the first time my anxiety went through the roof and I was in and out of the doctors and not sleeping.The beauty queens hellish ordeal started innocently enough.Wannabe star Deal - who goes by the stage name JAYD - added her on Facebook like hundreds of her other fans.I had a friend request on Facebook around June , but thought nothing of it, says Samantha, who was crowned Miss Poole  and Miss Dorset . I have lots of supporters, so I accepted it.Yet it soon became clear Deal wasnt an ordinary fan.He began besieging her with unwanted messages, shared pictures of her in a wedding dress with an engagement ring emoji, and bizarrely vowed to dedicate his BGT audition song to her.He also started turning up to events she was at - including SandFest music festival in Poole, Dorset, last July, where he asked the model for a photo together.He just appeared and tapped me on the shoulder, Samantha recalls.He said Hi Sam, its Jonathan Deal. I was like Oh hello, thinking in my head it was weird. Id never met him and for him to just turn up was really, really weird.She adds: I then got this message on Facebook: really nice to meet you.Obviously I replied, really nice to meet you too. I was being polite.The moment Samantha shared anything on Facebook, Deal would like or comment on it.Then last September, the rapper tried to gatecrash a VIP tent Samantha was in at the Bournemouth Air Festival - and posted a live blog on Facebook claiming he was in love with her.The same month, he turned up at the Miss England finals at Nottinghams prestigious Kelham Hall, where Samantha made the top  and was crowned Miss South Coast Charity Queen after attending more than  charity events in  months.It was here he disturbingly told people he was her boyfriend, before lunging in to kiss her backstage.I felt like a real-le princess that night, says Samantha, now a teaching assistant.I had a real diamond tiara on my head, worth £,, and I had a dress on that was stunning.She adds: Out the back, theres a little arch we walk through - Deal literally grabbed me and went to hug me and kiss my lips. I felt physically sick - his breath near mine made me shiver.It was a huge moment and he ruined it.Samantha managed to push her stalker off before fleeing to find her parents.But when she told them what had just happened, she was sickened to discover that Deal had been wandering around looking for her and had even tried to sit at her familys table to get close to her.They hadnt seen him [lunge at me] but I said, hes just tried to kiss me, she says.They said, the moment its finished, were leaving. We had to sneak out the back.Deal later told Samantha she only did well because the judges thought you were my girlfriend.And it wouldnt be the last time he confronted her.While Samantha blocked the stalker on Facebook straight after the Miss England final, she claims he later turned up at her work, pinned her against a wall and yelled: Unblock me! Unblock me!He also posted about her all over social media.Someone like myself who is always smiling and positive, [the harassment] caused me a lot of anxiety and stress, resulting in me having to go to the doctors a lot, Samantha says.I’ve been single over a year as I just haven’t been in the right headspace.It’s massively put me off going on and dating sites because I just don’t know who they and for all I know they could be him or people like him.Finally, after a three-month nightmare, the beauty queen reported Deal to police and he was arrested for his harassment campaign.But during the rappers court case, the model - who is also an ambassador for UK non-profit Help  Homeless Veterans - was distraught to learn that she was far from his only victim.I remember it so well, he was talking about his previous [ offences], she tells us.My dad grabbed my hand and I just cried in his arms in the courtroom.At this point I was adamant this guy is a sick freak.While Deal was out on bail, under strict conditions, Samantha says she rang police at all hours of the day in a state of terror, using a special panic phone shed been given.Dorset Police were absolutely incredible, they were at my beck and call, says Samantha, who became so stressed that she ended up on medication. I called them twice a day sometimes, panicking.She was relieved when, in February, Deal was finally caged for  weeks and handed an indefinite restraining order banning him from any form of contact with her, after he admitted harassment.But Samanthas stress ed only three months later when she discovered the con had been freed early, on May .Id felt so good knowing he was behind bars - there was no way he could stalk me or anyone near me - [but] after he was released I struggled, she says.I had a special doorbell fitted in my familys house. The doorbell rings and we can see whos at the door - andsomeone walks past the door we can see them.She adds: I was going round the house locking all the doors.Incredibly, on May , just four days after his release, Deal broke the terms of his restraining order by re-posting messages on Facebook relating to the Miss Dorset and Miss England contests Samantha had participated in.The rapper was hauled before Poole Magistrates Court last month, where he was convicted of two counts of breaching the order and sent back to prison for  weeks.But Samantha fears his short sentence means he could soon terrorise someone  - and has backed calls for a national stalking register to protect women from predators like Deal.The moment you come across Jonathan Deal, block him, she warns.Dont give him the time of day or a chance. Im that person who gave him a chance. I thought, Oh hes lovely, this will be OK. I should have blocked him a lot earlier.She adds: If there was a register, Deal would have been known and dealt with a lot quicker.Later this year, Stalking Protection Orders- backed by The Sun - will come into effect to help protect victims.More than one in five women and almost one in  men aged  to  have been victims of stalking since the age of , according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales.SPOs will prevent stalkers from contacting victims or approaching them through those around them - and will force them to register their name, address and any aliases they use.Offenders may also be banned from ­loitering near victims’ homes.A breach of the order will be punishable by up to five years behind bars.Today, while Deal languishes in jail, Samantha is looking ahead to the Miss Sovereign GB pageant - a contest that aims to empower girls and women while raising funds for charity.She decided to enter the pageant to help others and raise awareness of stalking - but is understandably taking a very dferent approach towards social media and her fans.I havent added anyone that I dont know recently and that is big for me, Samantha says. If I havent met you, you cant be on my Facebook. I need to know who you are.As for Deal, she adds that shell always worry about him.Someone like him doesnt give up - its sickening, she says.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also adds that: “I prefer a quiet le away from the day job.” And the band played Believe It If You Like.To recap: Paul is a master baker who caught a lucky break after being booked to appear on what became TV juggernaut The Great British Bake Off.Back then he was happily married to we Alex and, outside of an occasional media interview to plug the show, his home le never made the headlines.A bit of work and no play made Paul a dull boy when it came to clickbait. Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada. If hypocrisy was a movie, they’d all be winning Oscars.SCHOOLBOY Jay Hughes, , was talking to a friend outside a chicken shop in South London when a van pulled up and three men armed with machetes jumped out.His friend ran off and escaped but Jay stood in the shop doorway, where -year-old Nyron Jean-Baptiste stabbed him before boasting, “I got one”, and leaving the scene.Jean-Baptiste has now been jailed for “le” – whatever that means these days – while poor Jay’s distraught mother Cindy has been condemned to a letime of painful loss.Another devastated mother, Linda Burke-Monerville, spoke last month about sending her remaining children back to Nigeria for safety after losing three of her sons to violent crime in the UK.New Home Secretary Priti Patel said this week that she is resolutely focused on restoring law and order to our streets via extra police officers with greater powers.Talk is cheap – particularly when uttered by the majority of politicians. Action is what we need. And fast. Let’s hope she delivers before too many more young lives are snuffed out so brutally.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In winter there is nothing quite as satisfying as a steaming jam roly-poly with custard.Trle, my favourite, dates back  years. The word originally meant a light dessert, literally “a nothing”.But many desserts are disappearing from our menus.It’s not just the unfortunate overtones of roly–poly and spotted dick that are putting people off.Today, sugar, eggs, dairy and bread are out of fashion. People are opting for healthier desserts. Trendy cafes serve raw, dairy-free cakes.But I have to say “healthy dessert” is possibly the most disappointing combination of two words in the entire English language.Perhaps millennials are scared about the calories from eating out because of the growing pressure to look good on social media. If that’s the case, it’s very sad. Everything in moderation is fine.Processed food with lots of mysterious ingredients and high levels of salt and sugar is a very recent contrivance.Our grandparents ate ­simple, home-cooked meals made from fresh ingredients, and food was comparatively expensive, so people tended to eat smaller portions.Eat sensibly. You can enjoy sugar just as you might enjoy the occasional glass of wine.My kids love baking and making cakes is a great way to introduce them to cooking.Millennials are eating more fresh fruit, which is good.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in . In common with Italy, the Spanish economy is still smaller than it was before the - banking crisis.Not that you will hear any of this from Remainers. Every time a car factory is earmarked for closure or a steelworks runs into problems, we hear no end of people saying, “We told you so”.All bad news in the UK economy is automatically attributed to Brexit — on the BBC, especially. What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.The alternative to all this is for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and agree to keep free trade flowing, perhaps via a temporary deal while long-term arrangements are negotiated.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal. But the Eurozone economies already lagging behind will take the bigger hit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Theresa May, it never was. Brussels knew she didn’t even want to leave, never mind with No Deal.And whenever No Deal was threatened there would always be some helpful soul in her Cabinet to say . . . “That will never happen.”  People such as the treacherous Philip Hammond.Not any more. Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process.

But my guess is that he WILL get one.The EU likes to talk a hard game but it usually budges in the end. It is desperate to avoid No Deal.Andit doesn’t budge — fine. A bumpy road for a few weeks and we’ll be OK, better off than ever. And free. The big threat to Brexit is not the EU — it’s our Parliament, once again.The Labour Party has ditched all semblance of principle and is now for a second referendum.Worse, Boris has a majority of only one. That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on. Tug gently on one of its threads and the whole thing begins to unravel like a pink mohair jumper knitted by an imbecile. HERE’S some consol­ation for you cricket fans, in despair at our Ashes defeat. Steve Smith, the man who did most of the damage, is at least HALF English.He’s got an English mum and has dual nationality.He used to play cricket for a team in Sevenoaks, in Kent.So what we should do is ide his run total down the middle – we get half, the Aussies get half.

I didnt swing my door, but opened it carefully around halfway.As I did this I saw a cyclist level with my door and pulled it back. She was very close.I heard the sound of a bump and saw the cyclist hit by a taxi and being dragged along underneath it.Ive never been involved in an accident and Im devastated by what I saw. My sympathies got out to the cyclists family.The cabbie Alan Nicholas, who had  years experience, said he believed he had hit a pothole and didnt see the Professor swerve away from the van or before the collision.The -year-old became tearful as he told the inquest he was aware of her, but was looking in his right mirror for motorcyclists as he pulled out to overtake her and didnt see her hit his vehicle.He said he was doing around  to mph, adding: As I pulled out I was overtaking the cyclist, Im still looking at my mirror which Im assuming is about two or three seconds.I didnt see the door open or the cyclist come down.Then I felt a big bump which I had thought I had gone down a pothole.Mr Nicholas claimed he overtook the badly parked van giving her a . metre berth.The inquest was attended by Prof Bitner-Glindziczs husband David Miles, a professor of oncology, and their daughter, Helena Miles.He told the hearing: Maria was my we and the mother of our two children.My we was an internationally recognised scientist. She was developing therapies based on her unique understanding of the genetics.She was quite simply brilliant. You would probably expect me to say that and describe her as irreplaceable but, as one of her colleagues told me recently, nobody  has her knowledge base.Speaking of the inquest, he added: We sincerely hope that it generates urgent improvements in road safety that we believe are vital in preventing such devastating loss in the future.Delivering a narrative determination, Senior Coroner Mary Hassell recorded that Prof Bitner-Glindzicz died as a result of a collision at around .am on September  last year in St John Street,  metres south of the junction with Clerkenwell Road.She said the Professor was wearing a helmet and fluorescent strap, and her bike was in good condition.The Coroner said that the van driver didnt look before opening his door.She said the opening of the door caused the Professor to fall under the wheels of a black cab overtaking.Prof Bitner-Glindzicz was one of  cyclists to die on Londons roads last year.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels chiefs want showdown with boris but order him to keep the backstop first if he wants better deal before october 31","story":"The European Commission said the Withdrawal Agreement was “not up for negotiation” in a statement today.Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a news briefing in Brussels: “So far it...remains unchanged - this position that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for negotiation but we are open to talk about the political declaration.“And of course we are willing to talk and engage with Prime Minister Johnson.”The PM has so far refused to hold talks with EU chiefs and will not compromise on his stance against Theresa May’s hated deal.He has previously warned thatthe EU dont budge on getting rid of the backstop, it will be their choice to push Britain out of the bloc without an agreement by October .The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block on Brexit negotiations.However, Andreeva said it was not the Commission’s “business” to play a “blame game”.She added: “Our business is to prepare for a no deal.“Both sides negotiated with the very best intentions and the very best efforts.

Otherwise, No Deal is coming down the tracks, Barclay wrote in the Mail on Sunday.It is our firm view that Irish border issues should be dealt with in talks on the future agreement between the UK and the EU -- where they should always have been -- and were ready to negotiate in good faith on this basis.The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block in the Brexit talks and one of the reasons why Britains parliament rejected the deal three times.Johnson has vowed to get rid of the backstop and the new government has taken a hard line with the EU, saying it was turbo-boosting preparations for a no-deal Brexitthe bloc fails to agree alternative arrangements for the border.Barclay said officials were working on those arrangements.We have already started work across Whitehall to find the solutions, and they can and will be found, in the context of the free trade agreement we will negotiate with the EU after October , he wrote."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab travels 21309 miles in just three days in mammoth brexit trade deal blitz","story":"The Foreign Secretary was sent across the world by Boris Johnson to broker new trade deals with the US, Canada and Mexico on a three-day whistle-stop tour.On Tuesday, Raab flew into Toronto to meet foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, before jetting off for a crucial summit with President Donald Trump in Washington and finally arriving in Mexico City later today.Boris has ramped up efforts to strike new ambitious relationships with global partners as the UK prepares for its orce from EU on October .The PM has long spoken of the opportunities away from the bloc with nations like the US and Australia lined up for bonanza trade deals.On the first day of Raabs trans-Atlantic charm offensive, he told reporters that he wanted to take Canada and the UKs relationship to the “next level”.He said: “Were going to remain and we hope to be good European neighbours, partners and friends in the future but we do want to grasp those global opportunities and we want to expand our horizons and raise our level of ambitions in the world.”After Toronto, Raab zoomed over to the White House to meet with President Trump and key officials including, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Wednesdays meeting was a huge success for No with the President again reaffirming his “huge appetite” for a trade deal with Britain after Brexit.Pompeo offered another boost for Boris, when he said: “We support the United Kingdom’s sovereign choice, however Brexit ultimately shakes out.“And we’ll be on the doorstep, pen in hand, ready to sign a new free trade agreement at the earliest possible time.”Raab’s fast and furious tour ends today with a visit to Mexico City where he believes economic links between our two nations will be a “win-win”.He said: “The UK is excited to be working with our Mexican friends to develop a win-win relationship.“There are huge opportunities to boost two-way trade, create jobs, tackle poverty and inequality, and address key Mexican priorities such as strengthening transparency and reducing corruption.”Boris is desperate for Britain to make new trade links as the government prepares for a No Deal scenario with Brussels chiefs.The PM has warned Tory rebels are EU negotiators that we will be leaving the bloke “do or die” by Halloween.Raabs first two weeks as Foreign Secretary have been jam-packed -

Marcus Stewart, , from Coventry, was arrested by an armed policeman on the beach after a head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an -day-old baby. Footage of the arrest shows Stewart being frogmarched away from the sand barefoot in just a pair of shorts, an officer walking behind him with his gun in his hand. Spanish state prosecutors have charged Stewart with one count of reckless driving, nine counts of wounding and one count of damage.  Prosecutors are also seeking just over £, in compensation for the nine people injured in the May ,  incident. They include the pedestrians hurt outside the Ocean Club in Puerto Banus and others injured when the Audi Q Stewart was in crashed after a police chase. No charges have been brought against a second Brit held in the drama, named at the time as Liam O’Neill, , from Walsgrave near Coventry, and identied by police as a passenger in the Audi. He is no longer a suspect. Stewart is accused in a nine-page indictment of getting behind the wheel despite taking cocaine and being over the Spanish drink-drive limit. Prosecutors say he got in the Audi belonging to a friend after a fight as he left the Ocean Club and “conscious of the danger and with absolute contempt for the lives of pedestrians, accelerated at great speed on a walkway against people who were leaving the establishment.”  One of his alleged victims was hit from behind before Stewart “sparked panic among people there, forcing them to flee to avoid being run over because there was nowhere for them to take cover” according to the prosecution document. Stewart was held a couple of miles away after a crash at the end of a high-speed police chase which ended with him smashing head-on into a Skoda. The days-old baby travelling with her mum and dad in the other vehicle survived unharmed but the family’s pet Yorkshire Terrier called Nina died. Stewart was found to be twice over the Spanish drink-drive limit when he was breathalysed.Cocaine was also detected in his bloodstream during tests, according to police. Marbella’s then-mayor Jose Bernal said in the aftermath of the drama the incident was sparked by an altercation at the Ocean Club after an annual champagne party there attended by the two suspects. He was forced to make a defence of the area at a press conference by insisting “Marbella is a safe place and when isolated incidents like this occur, the emergency services and forces of law and order have shown they act immediately and efficiently.” He branded the two Brits involved as two drunks on drugs who had a fight in a club got in a car and ended up running over three people who thankfully survived.

Portia Nancarrow, , says she forked out £, for the last-minute trip with working holiday organisers Workers Family, which promised her memories that will last a letime. But she says she was put in a filthy apartment above a takeaway which had a smashed bed and rubbish strewn over the floor. She even alleges she awoke on the first night last week to discover a stranger sitting on the end of her bed thanks to having no lock on her door. She says she chased the man out when he suggested she s*** him. Have you been on a horror holiday  Contact webnews@trinitymirror    Portia, from Ebbw Vale, south Wales, said: It was actually disgusting. I thought I was big and tough before I went out there but now I realise Iaposm not. When I first got there they put me in this accommodation [above a takeaway]. But Workers Family says it offers safe and clean accommodation for young people wanting to escape the UK and have an amazing summer. Portia flew back to the UK two nights after arriving and has since complained to the firm. She wants to warn other young people to be careful when planning to work in holiday destinations.    The teenager continued: There were four beds that were already taken up. I had to ring one of the reps and he moved me upstairs. This new room they put me in was stinking. It was unreal. When you went in, all the doors had holes in them from where people had been fighting. There was a smashed up bed all over the floor, rubbish everywhere, the floor was stinking. I took my shoes off for two seconds and my feet were black. Nothing had been cleaned. All the bed was broken and that had to be chucked outside. They left that on the balcony. But Workers Family denied Portia did not have access to pillows. Tony Furnival, one of its directors, did concede it was the lowest standard of accommodation that was not fit for tourists - but said the workers should expect that.  And while Portia says she paid £ for the accommodation, Workers Family claims it charged £. In my room there were three of us but just two beds. In the room above me there were five boys and three beds, Portia continued. The mattresses were all dirty - it looked like mud. We didnapost have pillows either. It was only by chance that I took my own love heart pillow on the plane. I said to the rep that none of us had pillows and he said aposthereaposs nothing we can do about that - thereaposs another  people waiting for themapos. Weaposd spent all this money and they didnapost give me a pillow. After complaining to the staff, Portia claims she was initially told to clean the apartment herself but when she refused, another season worker was paid £ to do it. Portia added: The first night my door was open because there was no air-con. This man walked into my room, sat on to my bed and said aposs*** meapos. This was a stranger. I was screaming at him to get out and I didnapost see him after that. For all they know something could have happened to me. They get your money, send you over there then thataposs it. She alleges one of the bosses there told her to get [off her] lazy fat a** and cleaned the f***ing apartment.  Iaposve never seen anything like it to be honest. Iaposm gobsmacked, Portia said. I went out on my own and I think thataposs why they took advantage. The whole experience was awful. Theyaposve massively done me over. Theyaposve taken all of that money that I could have spent on something . My nan and dad paid for it - thataposs whataposs even worse. They were really worried. In a y statement, Mr Furnival said: The broken wardrobe, thataposs pretty bad. That should have been fixed. As regards bunk-beds, itaposs hostel-style accommodation. You might as well take a picture of any hostel across the world. If it is dirty, thataposs the people that are living there. Itaposs hostel-style accommodation that theyaposre responsible for.   There is cleaning to a degree [by cleaners]. Because itaposs the end of the season there are so many places she could have been moved. I donapost want you thinking for one second that Iaposm saying nothing sheaposs said is true, but these young people get the lowest standard of accommodation. Itaposs not good enough for year round people, itaposs not good enough for tourists. These claims that people are going out there is so far from what I know to be true, that Iaposm a bit offended. I wasnapost there on that day so these things about a lad going in the room, I canapost lie and say I was there. But itaposs shared accommodation. Weaposve been doing this a lot of years and while thereaposs ious complaints come about, the way sheaposs described itthis was as such aas she said, do you not think it would be a national scandal  There were faults on our part, but the way itaposs been painted, itaposs really over the top.

Whitney Gallacher quickly sprang into action when she spotted a youngster stabbed outside her home in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, last year. While others filmed the incident, the -year-old rushed to his aid and called emergency services. But tragically, just over a week later, she was found dead in bed at her home, in what a coroner has now ruled was a tragic accident. Her grief-stricken mum described her as loud, honest, extremely hard working, funny, loyal, supportive and loving, following the inquest into her death at Avon Coroneraposs Court on Wednesday, reports Bristol Live.Her death prompted a fundraising page which raised more than a thousand pounds in her memory, and a trip by all her family and friends back to Grimsby, where she was born, to mark her birthday and celebrate her le earlier this year. In a read inquest at Avon Coroners Court in Flax Bourton, near Bristol, assistant coroner Peter Harrowing said Whit had thrown a late night party at her flat in Midsomer Norton on the night of Saturday, October , last year.    Friends came and enjoyed a good night, and Dr Harrowing read written evidence from two of her friends who said they had noticed she had a bottle of medicinal morphine and occasionally took a swig from it.

The Brainy Dogs scheme has created more than  le-changing new friendships to date, while giving offenders the chance to learn new skills. Now the National Lottery-funded project, the only one of its kind in the UK, is a finalist in the th Birthday National Lottery Awards, where you can help choose the winners. Brainy Dogs, which is run by the charity Headway Suffolk, is expanding to include one-to-one pet therapy sessions for clients who are not suitable for a companion dog and care home visits.  It is also offering people on probation, veterans, those with mental health problems and children excluded from school opportunities to train the animals. Headway Suffolk chief executive Helen Fairweather says: “Companion dogs can make a real dference to someone who is living with a neurological condition. “Their disabilities can often be hidden and may leave them with a personality change or dficulties that mean they lose friends and their families struggle to support them. “A dog can fill this void and provide help, comfort and confidence as they attempt to navigate le.” The charity boss came up with the unique scheme after reading a book about an assistance dog who aided the recovery of a brain-injured man and then watching a programme about prisoners in Australia training dogs. She realised that many of the people Headway works with could benefit from a similar furry friend. Many are not eligible to receive a dog from other charitable organisations as they are not regarded as having adequate need. Helen teamed up with Blue Cross Felixstowe and HMP Hollesley Bay in Suffolk for a one-year pilot in  and the concept has gone from strength to strength, receiving a £, grant from the National Lottery last year to expand. Brainy Dogs Coordinator Sophie Wellum-Mayes says training is inidual to each dog and client, taking around eight weeks.  Volunteer trainers gain work experience, le skills and improved confidence, along with improving the futures of the dogs and their new owners. She says: “The dogs calm clients in a way humans cannot. They do not judge and for many people, this is a rare feeling. “We have been told that the dogs are a leline, they have stopped a couple of clients from ending their lives. “They get people out into social networks, give them a sense of normality and something in common with others. There are similar emotional and confidence benefits for the trainers too.” The National Lottery Awards are an annual celebration of the UK’s best National Lottery-funded projects, with this year marking  years since the first draw. The winners will receive £, towards their extraordinary work and appear on a star-studded BBC One show in November. Voting is now open in five categories.

Onyeka Onyekwulu, , stalked the streets of South London as a teen and climbed the ranks to be one of the bosses of his fearsome gang. He carried a blade, once stabbed a rival during a brawl and witnessed one of his friends kned to death. But now his old foes approach him with praise for turning his le around, and he offers them prayers rather than violence. He insists government cuts to youth services have played a part in the rise of kne crime.    Pastor Onyeka attended a Kids Company centre in Camberwell - which closed in  amid a cash crisis and abuse allegations. But he saw first hand the impact youth facilities had on youngsters, and what happened when it shut its doors. He said: “The government has a part to play. A lot of youngsters are bored and have nobody to look up to at home. “If your time is well managed by a studio, youth club, you don’t have time to feel like picking up a kne to cause damage to your community. “What helped me was a youth centre, Kids Company, and when it closed down it made it worse. “You can’t close things down and then be surprised when things get worse. Me and my friends were calmer, happier, when we were at a youth centre.    “Then we had nothing to do and we were back on the street fighting again. The Government needs to reopen youth centres. “We would be funded to go paintballing and other activities during the summer. “They need to reopen the youth clubs that they’ve closed and need to give people who have lived that lestyle more of a voice.” The average cash-strapped council under the Tories has reduced spending on services such as social clubs and youth workers by  per cent, and some places have seen funding plummet by  per cent in three years, it was found in May. Analysis by the All-Party Parliamentary Groupon Kne Crime found that areas suffering the largest cuts to youth spending have seen bigger increases in kne crime. As part of the Mirror’s kne crime campaign, we are calling on the government to reverse the cuts to youth services.  Onyeka’s turnaround is remarkable - having entered the gang world aged  in the Camberwell and Brixton areas of South London. He left it all behind him after being guided by a friend towards the church aged , and on the back of watching a pal murdered. He was ordained as an evangelist in  and has been preaching, both on the streets and in church, since last year. The Pastor heads up a youth ministry named Youngsters on Fire in Tottenham, North London, under the umbrella of Kingdom Le Ministries. He mentors hundreds of people, many of who have become involved in violent gangs as he once was. “It was just my environment and nothing to do with my upbringing,” he said. “Sometimes you can be not a bad person butyou’re surrounding yourself with bad people, it’s a matter of time before you become like them.” He said the root causes, including neglect at home, need to be tackled socially for true change to be made.  “There are ious reasons why kne crime is happening. Some of the people involved didn’t have any father care or a mentor,” he said. “A lot of people who started in kne crime didn’t first start it - they just went somewhere where they felt love. “Older people involved recruit them to take up the baton and carry it on.” In his own gang-land journey, he recalled: “As time went on I became one of the leaders of the gang, taking part in criminal activity. “I had a lot of post code beef. A lot of fights and confrontations.” It came to a head one night when a brawl broke out and he stabbed a rival. “It was a confrontation where I was protecting myself because he was going at me,” he said. “I try not to think about it. He had a weapon. It was a war at that time and I was heavily involved. So it was normal, at that time. “It was you get me, or I get you, and I got him at that time. It could have been me just as easily. “At that time, I didn’t feel the best after I’d done it but that’s the le I chose to live. “That’s why I always try to advise people that whatever you do, you’ll pay for it.  “I don’t like to dwell on it but people might be going through the same thing and the fact I can relate to them helps them open up to me. “Evenyou’ve had a bad past, don’t let that deny you from becoming great. “My story is to encourage people that you don’t have to live that le to feel respected or empowered or feel you’re the man. “When you go down that path you’re on your own, and all your family and loved ones will have to bear the consequences of the damage you’ve caused by your actions. “If I didn’t live that lestyle then a lot of the youngsters that come to me - who have come out of jail, are selling drugs, or doing things I used to do - would not feel comfortable in confiding in me. “But they know I’ve done what they’ve done and worse. How can you advise someoneyou’ve not lived that le  “I lived that lestyle and it got me nowhere but look at me now, I’m -years-old leading a powerful youth ministry. “Lives are being changed, we help people get employment, accommodation, and travelthey are struggling financially. “Now I feel more relaxed, more at peace, and more happy than ever.” “When I speak to the youth, I know that I almost went down the route that could have ended with me dead or in prison. And I say to them ‘don’t you dare even go there’. “I’m trying to lead them to the right path.”  Onyeka was  when his -year-old friend was stabbed in front of him in Brixton, and died hours later. He said it made him realise as the years went on that le was “not a joke”. “At  I realised being in gangs would not bring me any joy or fulfilment and I decided to make a U-turn, and started going to church. “This is where everything changed. I surrendered my le to God and began to build my spiritual le up. “The people I had problems with, no longer had problems with me after a while. “Some of them approached me in a way to fight but when they realised, they said ‘I respect your change’. “Some would test to seeI would react because they know what I was liked before but I was chilled and so they know the change was genuine.

A source told Mail Online: There are three elements, the basic plank, the side plank and the prone sky e, all of which are positions Kate can hold for  seconds or longer and repeat at least ten times each. The side plank requires you to balance on your side, holding your body straight with feet together and one arm flexed directly under your shoulder. Meanwhile, the prone sky e plank is slightly less excruciating, as you have to lie on your tummy and gently raise your chest off the floor until your tummy muscles beg for mercy.    She also uses an inflated gym ball to work her abs, an insider said.

Ben Needham who went missing many years ago, Madeleine McCann who is still on everybody’s minds and now Nora. Madeleine McCann vanished from her familyaposs holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May  aged three. Ben Needham was  months when he disappeared on  July  on the Greek island of Kos.  Mr Gamble called for the National Crime Agency to assist in the hunt for Nora, believing they can bring additional resources and experience. He said it was in no way to undermine Malaysian Police, but rather to support them. Mr Gamble said it was such a rare kind of investigation that few organisations have the ability to deal with them - but says the NCA does. Noraaposs parents Meabh and Sebastien believe she was abducted, but police say there is no evidence the teen, who has special needs, was snatched from her room at the Dusun resort . Her disappearance has apparently left search and rescue team members puzzled, with one claiming: Not even a footprint was left behind. Police have questioned  people and they believe she is still close to the resort about an hour south of Kuala Lumpur and they have not ruled out the possibility she was kidnapped.

They are: Natasha McDonald, , of Lawrence Weston Patrick Brown, , of Bishopsworth Leanne Harford, , of Bishopsworth and Thomas Porter, , of Bishopsworth. Judge James Patrick handed them each an -month community order, with rehabilitation. You bullied him the night before he died and the death casts a long shadow, he said.

She suffers from a condition so rare only three specialists in the world can treat it. And one wrong move her head could mean she is internally decapitated, causing instant death. Rachel suffers from atlantoaxial instability, which means Rachelaposs spine partially dislocates each time she turns her head to the left, increasing her risk of paralysis. The working mum, from Worcester, Worcestershire, has to permanently wear a neck brace to prevent a total dislocation, which would kill her.    She has also been diagnosed with cervical medullary syndrome, which is caused by brain stem compression and leads to excruciating headaches , dizziness and fatigue. Rachel, who has a -year-old daughter with her husband Guy, , said: I live in constant fear of paralysis and death. It’s hard to describe that feeling. I feel like I can’t do anything. I go to work for a few hours a day, come home and lie horizontally on the couch. I do not do anything . I’m a determined person and I have to try and do what I can. I know I can’t give up. She and her husband are now trying to raise £, to pay for a surgeon in Barcelona, Spain. He is just one of three in the world able to carry out the operation to fuse her neck and skull. Rachel said: In May  I spoke to a specialist based in Barcelona who said my case is severe and I’m at risk of internal decapitation. Turning to the left causes my cervical spine junction to partially dislocate and I could die instantlyit fully dislocates. After being diagnosed in May, doctors believe her condition is caused by a connective tissue disorder.    Rachelaposs collagen quota - the bodyaposs most abundant protein and major component of connective tissues - is not as high as it should be. She said: My neck has become too unstable to support the weight of my head, meaning I have to take extreme care. I can only wear my neck brace for four hours a day, because of the risk of muscles wasting away, which will be even more dangerous. I try to avoid turning from side-to-side. I can’t move to the left side. But the decapitation risk will go after the surgery, eventhere is still some pain. I’m desperate to get to Barcelona and have it done. It might not get rid of all my symptoms, but it will save my le. Until August  Rachel was fit and health but then she started a new medication for an overactive immune system. She had to be hospitalised three times between September and October that year because of extreme vomiting. Rachel lost two stone in just six weeks. She said: I couldn’t move off the couch. Even though I had stopped taking the medication pretty much straight away, the symptoms continued. I was back and forth to the hospital and I thought I could have an eating disorder, because I couldn’t get to the bottom of it.    My wedding to Guy was coming up in February  and I was thinking maybe I was subconsciously trying to lose weight for that. In October , after an MRI scan ruled out a pituitary tumour, Rachel was diagnosed with Addison’s disease, a rare disorder of the adrenal glands where they stop producing enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Treated with steroids,cortisol levels fall signicantly, it can cause a fatal adrenal crisis. She said: I was taking a lot of steroids but still losing weight. My wedding dress had to be taken in from a size  to a size six. I was having tremors in my hands, caused by adrenalin, I was exhausted all the time and would just fall asleep at any moment. It got to the point where I could not drive my daughter to school in case I fell asleep at the wheel. In August  we moved closer to my work and my daughter’s school, so I did not have to drive as far. But after she hit her head on a ceiling fan while moving into her new home in August last year, her symptoms got even worse. Rachel said: A week after that I went into adrenal crisis due to water retention and was admitted to hospital. It happened again a week later and I was back to hospital. After I ed home I was in constant pain. My head felt really heavy on my shoulders and I would get dizzy and lightheaded.  I started researching myself and came up with postural tachycardia syndromewhich is an abnormal increase in heart rate that occurs after sitting up or standing, causing dizziness amongst other things. She booked to see a private endocrinologist - a specialist treating problems with hormones - in the autumn  and had an MRI scan, which came back clear. After more visits to the GP she was referred to a cardiologist in March. An electrocardiogram test to check the heart’s rhythm showed she was tachycardic – meaning her heart was beating faster than normal while at rest - and then a tilt table test led to an official diagnosis of PoTS. Rachel said: PoTs is a secondary condition and is not caused by Addison’s, so I knew it must have been caused by something . In May  a neurologist also diagnosed her with Chiari malformation, a non-le threatening condition, where the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal, according to the NHS. Rachel said: I posted my MRI scan in a Chiari malformation Facebook group and people were commenting, saying Chiari was the least of my problems. The dizziness was getting worse. It felt my head was too heavy for my neck. At work I would have to prop up my head with my hands. It felt like an enormous weight. I couldn’t hold it myself.  I was getting really bad headaches. The worst was at the bottom of my head. It felt like something was pushing and going to pierce through my head. Sitting up would be agony. It would last for hours. It was totally debilitating. I could not physically stand up. My legs would just give way and in the end we had to hire a mobility scooter for me.” In June  Rachel saw another neurologist, who diagnosed her with platybasia, a flattening of the skull base, and basilar invagination, an infolding of the base of the skull, which occurs when one of the vertebra migrates upwards. Then paying £, for a private upright MRI scan, Rachel asked for the images be sent to Dr Gilete, a top neurosurgeon she had found via a Facebook group in Barcelona, Spain - one of only three experts worldwide dealing with minimal invasive spinal surgery techniques. Having assessed the MRI and carried out a detailed questionnaire, he added to her diagnosis atlantoaxial instability - where the vertebrae holding her skull in place become unstable and dislocated, hydrocephalus, which is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, and cervical medullary syndrome, which is caused by brain stem compression. Luckily, a private health policy she has through work has covered a lot of her costs, but Rachel has still spent almost £, of her own money on consultations. And now she wants the surgery that could save her le.  Rachel said: I will have to have two operations. The first will remove the odontoid bone which is compressing my brain stem and the second a week later will fuse my skull and neck together. I will have a three week stay in hospital and then three weeks in an apartment with nurses. I just want to have it done as soon as possible. No one really knows whataposs caused it. I still wonderitaposs connected to my reaction to the new medication I took for an overactive immune system. I feel I have missed out on so much. I can’t go to my daughter’s assemblies and parentsapos evenings. I tried to go and was walking to a classroom when my legs gave way and I fell into the printer. If Iaposd banged my head it does not bear thinking about what might have happened. I hardly sleep. I can’t go out really. A trip to the supermarket is a day out for us. Rachel has praised her husband for his unerring support during her health crisis. She said: I do not know what I would do without Guy. I have had a lot of time off and it’s been a struggle, but he has been fantastic and tried to keep a bit of normality. Meanwhile, Guy lives in constant fear that his we could be taken from him.

Whenever she goes on dates, she says people asksheaposs out with her dad - and her -year-old son Tom has banned his friends from visiting their home after they branded Shany a MILF. The mum says sheaposs even caused a car crash as a -something driver was so busy gawping at her in a queue of traffic that he pulled out in front of a lorry - who smashed into him. Now Shany, who works as an extra on Emmerdale, has declared sheaposs done with all men except for her son, who is already worried that he looks older than her.    I havenapost aged a bit since I was  and people still think Iaposm that age when they meet me, Shany, of York, says. It was a nightmare when I was younger as no one took me seriously but now Iaposm reaping the rewards as I look  years younger. Everyone is shocked when I tell them my age and they want to know my secret. Itaposs simple - Iaposm single. It keeps me young. I donapost have the stress of dealing with a man. I come and go as I please and that means I donapost have any wrinkles or worry lines.    I find people staring at me before askingIaposve had botox or fillers, but I havenapost had anything done. You can tellwomen have had surgery and I donapost like that look. Iaposm completely natural and am lucky to have great skin and a happy le now. Shany, who regularly appears in Emmerdale, has always looked younger. Blokes used to say I would be pretty when I grew up - but that was when I was , she says. When I married and was pregnant strangers gave me bad looks assuming I was a teenage mum when in fact I was worried Iaposd left it almost too late because I was . No one spoke to me at the school gate when Tom was older because they thought I wasnapost old enough to look after him and even now when I have foreign students over to stay they ask where my mother is as they assume Iaposm the teenager.  Itaposs funny now but it was upsetting when I was younger. I didnapost have a lot of friends and was isolated as the other mums thought I was some kind of Lolita who would steal their husbands. After splitting up with her husband - because he didnapost like the attention her looks attracted - Shany decided to date and instantly regretted it. I would never want to be a cougar and go out with anyone younger as I want to feel secure and protected by an older man, she says, aposbut itaposs hardly romantic when other people askthe man youaposre with is your dad. One time I was in a pub on a third date with a man I quite liked and a rugby team came in and some of the lads started pointing before one asked why I was out with my father and my date went berserk. They ended up fighting while I sneaked out of the back door. I never saw him again.  Shany has been compared to Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and says her son banned her from going to his school plays, parents evenings and meeting his friends from the age of  because of her looks.

He was mortied and said I couldnapost be seen out with him again. Now, after going through the menopause, Shany has decided to celebrate her youthful good looks by entering beauty pageants and in the past  months she has won four, beating thousands of contestants more than half her age. Most of them are  but they accepted me because they thought I was in my s, she says.  When I said I was  they looked shocked and said I was older than their mothers. I love it! Shany has been crowned Miss Congeniality at the Ms Galaxy UK pageant, runner-up in the Face of the World - beating , other women - and came third in Smile of the Universe.

The two worlds of the neglected Love Lane estate and the £billion ­Tottenham Hotspur stadium could scarcely be further apart. And, while local people were delighted the club decided to stay here, the tension between the football club as a global brand and a community hub has rarely felt so taut. Inside the giant glass bowl of the stadium everything is measured in big numbers – , seats, a -metre bar that can pull , pints per minute, a -metre high South Stand. A projected annual turnover of £million a year. The prawn sandwich brigade even get their own Michelin-starred chef. And hiding under the hallowed turf is an articial pitch ready for NFL to arrive from the US later this year.    In a future Sky Walk attraction, visitors will one day be able to abseil from the roof. Outside, you are standing on streets that are among the % most deprived in Britain. The stadium redevelopment was an opportunity to lt the prospects of the people who live here. But, instead, as the regeneration surrounding the stadium continues with a development known as High Road West, many families now fear they will simply be swept away. A new walkway proposed to bring fans from a new station entrance at White Hart Lane station brings its own statistics.  social housing homes threatened with demolition in a borough with a severe housing shortage.    Where , households are on the council’s waiting list and , families are stuck in temporary accommodation. Meanwhile,  small manufacturing businesses on the Peacock estate, providing hundreds of decent local jobs, are facing eviction via a ­compulsory purchase order. The proposals will also mean the loss of a library. And, perhaps worse for fans who will never afford the Michelin-served boxes, the demolition of match day institution ‘Chick King’. Even the football club itself – which is not responsible for High Road West – says it doesn’t agree with the extended plans “as we do not believe it is aspirational enough for residents”. A club spokesman said: “We have a proud track record delivering new homes and community facilities in Tottenham and everyone can now clearly see the new stadium as a primary example of our commitment to the area.  “To date we have created over , jobs in the area and delivered over  affordable homes. We are a key part of the local community with a long-term stake in the success of the area.” Now, days after the th anniversary of the Addison Act which paved the way for large-scale council housing, campaigners are calling for Haringey Council and its development partner Lendlease PLC to reconsider their plans for High Road West. This week, at London’s Tate Modern gallery, as part of an exhibition ­celebrating ­football, visitors were confronted by a wooden horse built on the Peacock industrial estate, ­symbolising residents’ fears the stadium hides the borough’s real plans to socially cleanse them. An accompanying picture book, Tottenham’s Trojan Horse, by Dr Mark Panton and Amanda Lillywhite, tells the story from the point of view of local residents. Latest plans include , new homes, but only  will be council houses and none are likely to eventually house current Love Lane residents. The one glimmer of light is that Sadiq Khan ’s City Hall has told developers they could forfeit mayoral fundsthey do not consult residents properly.At the Tate, veteran anti-poverty campaigner Rev Paul Nicolson, , called the regeneration “an abuse of power by land-grabbers”. Over the years, residents of the Love Lane estate, earmarked for the walkway demolition, have been replaced by temporary social tenants who have fewer rights and can be easily evicted when the time comes.  “I have been on this estate for almost four years and it is getting to a point where it is becoming uncomfortable to live here,” says Tash Bonner, who lives with his mum and sister, and is chairman of the campaign group, TagLove Lane. “The council has stopped maintenance of the flats, because in the long run they know it is going to be knocked down. We keep getting told that we are part of this regeneration, but we have had no certainty about where we will be rehoused. We are just living day to day.” Joanna Morrison, , who lives on the estate with her partner and their two children, said: “We are living on a demolition site yet no one from the council tells you what is happening. Three years it’s been like this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal fans think carole middleton","story":"NewsRoyal fans think Carole Middleton has given away who her favourite grandchild isThe clues are apparently hidden in plain sight on the Party Pieces websiteShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailItaposs not a truth many adults would readily admit, but plenty of parents and grandparents do have a secret favourite.And while heaposs one of three VERY cute kids, royal fans think itaposs Prince George who is the apple of grandmother Carole Middletonaposs eye.The clues are apparently all there, hidden in plain sight on the Party Pieces website.According to The Express, the kidsapos birthday cakes on the party supplies site are whataposs giving it away.In the gallery of personalised cakes that can be decorated with the name of a child in icing across the top, aposGeorgeapos is one of the most typically featured.   Other designs also feature the names aposJamesaposand, intriguingly, aposArchieapos - which, as we all know, is what Harry and Meghan plumped for.

We just wanted to show the family that as a collective in Britain and the UK we are behind them and supporting them. This personal experience meant that Ms Diplacto decided she wanted to donate to the family to show how many people were thinking of them, reports Surrey Live. She added: This all came about because on Monday night I was thinking about the story and decided I wanted to do something and donate some money.  I had a look online but I couldnapost find anything so I decided to try and set something up myself. I think it has been one of the craziest things I have ever done, I have never done anything like this before and it is great that it seems to be going in the right direction. I am a bit of a novice with social media as well so I have been begging friends for likes and shares, the response has been unbelievable.  The appeal, which was set up on crowdfunding website gofundme  on Tuesday , has so far raised the equivalent of nearly £, in Euros. Ms Diplacto says that the public reaction has been the most touching part of setting up the fundraiser. She said: The reaction we have had has been amazing. We have had words from people who we donapost know and have never met but they have just been the purest words ever. The current target is set at €, but Ms Diplacto says she will continue to reach for the sky and raise as much as possible. Once the fundraiser is complete the money will be passed on to the family through the help of gofundme and the politan Police.

The men were forced to give urine samples following shore leave in Florida. The sub continued its top-secret operations before ing to Faslane naval base on the Clyde. The men were taken from the vessel when it ed to Faslane and were disciplined. It’s believed the three were part of a larger group of crew members suspected of having taken cocaine during the “run ashore”. The other sailors in the group are understood to have passed CDTs.  The source said: “Drug busts on the V fleet are rare because the submariners are considered to be the best of the best considering the job they do. “The men would have been celebrating being off the boat for a short time but there’s celebrating and there’s taking Class A drugs while working on a vessel that carries nuclear missiles. “Bosses would have had no choice but to sack them. They knew the risksthey were caught but their carelessness in leaving the packets lying around has raised some eyebrows. “The Royal Navy has a zero-tolerance policy towards drug-taking so anything like that, you’re out.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman carries upstairs housing complaint","story":"NewsWoman who has to carry sister upstairs told shes th in queue for bungalowMaureen Atherton, of Liverpool, cares for her three sisters, including Jeanette who needs round-the-clock care - and wants a bunglow so her family can live under one roofShareCommentsByBrendan McFadden:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who has to carry her disabled sister upstairs to wash her has hit out at a housing association as sheaposs th in a queue for a bungalow.

After applying to Torus for a bungalow just metres away from her home — so her family can live under one roof — she was devastated to find out she is so far back in the queue.    Maureen said: It is just so tiring, I do not know what to do, I donapost know where to turn next. “Itaposs every single day. I get her up at .am, I have to take her up and down the stairs to wash her and then she canapost move for the rest of the day.” Maureenaposs sisters - Mary and Kathleen - live just metres away but -year-old Kathleen suffers from dementia and -year-old Mary has severe agoraphobia.  Kathleenaposs condition means she can’t leave a small area around their home so would not be able to move far away, according to Maureen.    The bungalow next door to Mary and Kathleen, which is also owned by their landlord Torus, is set to become available and would be large enough for all of them to live in.

Maureen said: “We were happy to stay in our house until we realised we couldnapost get a stairlt . “They said I was going to have to go on Property Pool and a medical access list. “We were the first names on the property.” A spokeswoman for Torus said they had to work within the rules of Property Pool, the system for allocating homes in Liverpool.

However, we must work within the parameters of the local choice-based lettings system. “The family are included in Band B High Health welfare with a date of application   .

And they are in no doubt Tory cuts to youth services, soaring inequality, drugs and a lack of neighbourhood police are to blame, leaving many bored teenagers vulnerable to the clutches of gangs.After feeling ignored by politicians, the group has now demanded Boris Johnson tackle the kne crime epidemic sweeping Britain before more lives are lost.They delivered a letter and -point manesto to the PM today, which includes calls for more cash for youth services and tackling the causes of crime such as a lack of housing and jobs.    It came as figures showed kne crime hit a record high in  , up  per cent on the previous year. But research found real-terms spending on youth services by  per cent over the past three years. One of the group, Eden Lunghy, has friends who lost people to stabbings. The -year-old, from Camden, North London, said: “I definitely think budget cuts to youth club services and after school provision has had a big impact. “Before, people felt they could go ­somewhere and do activities and distract themselves from what’s going on.    “But when your youth club is being shut all you can do is hang around your estate with friends. That can lead to young people feeling bored and ­disconnected from society and become a group that causes trouble that ­escalates to rivalry with other groups and leads to fatal stabbings.” Eden also warned Mr Johnson’s pledge to reverse cuts to police forces would not on its own tackle the problem.  Ensuring young people feel safe on the streets is importantthey are to stop carrying knives.  Work needs to be done to challenge the idea that carrying a kne is the norm.  Schools need to provide better support to young people who are at risk of involvement in crime, those excluded from school need a safe place to go.  Investment in youth services and mentors is key to helping young people escape violent lestyles.  We need to tackle the underlying causes of violent crime in communities such as lack of housing and unemployment.  Gangs need to be prevented from using social media as a means of recruiting vulnerable young people.  All media have a responsibility not to perpetuate myths that young people need to carry a kne or contribute towards young people becoming desensitised to violence.  Introduce more community police officers who can build relationship and help prevent crime before it starts.  Tackling the drugs market is a key part of tackling kne crime.  The Government need to provide support to young people who are either already involved or a risk of becoming involved in county lines activity. There needs to be a clear strategy on how to help these victims of exploitation escape involvement with gangs.  Custody should be used as a last resort – often it only serves to help young people become ‘better criminals’.  Rehabilitation, particularly helping young people gain skills and access employment should be central to the youth justice system.   She said: “Just adding more police isn’t going to solve the issue. “The Prime Minister and other organisations need to find the root causes in order to dismantle it and ensure young people aren’t getting stabbed and killed on the street. “It’s heartbreaking to see how one fatal stabbing can cause a broken ­community.  Group member, Zak Hall, told how youngsters were kning people just to get “likes” on social media The -year-old, of Redbridge, East London, revealed his brother was stabbed in January. He said: “He’s okay. He survived. I live in a good part of London, yet my brother was sliced with a kne. My older brother was in an attempted car-jacking by two guys with rusty knives. Somebody I know was murdered on his birthday last August. Social media is partly to blame. Social media, drill music and teenage angst all mixed together causes violence.  When you can track ­popularity by likes, it is going to cause people to do things for likes. People can attack others for likes.” Hamza Taouzzale, , was elected as a Westminster Labour councillor at  in a bid to combat kne crime. And he wants more youngsters to be involved in the battle. Hamza said: “We’re trying to engage more young people and get them to the table. Especially when a lot of ­policies are made for young people, without the input from young people.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man armed rifle ammo walks","story":"NewsMan armed with rle and ammo walks into Walmart days after El Paso shootingThe man filmed the chaos in the Spingfield store as he walked through the entire shop before an off-duty fireman held him at gunpointShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video gun-nut-walks-walmart-carrying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man dressed in tactical gear and armed with  rounds of ammo filmed himself walking into a Walmart store less than a week after the El Paso shooting.

Volunteer Olesya Kutepova heard a bear-like roar and thought the beast had attacked rescuers - but realised it was Anna making noises to try and scare the bear away. “But it wasn’t a bear, it was granny Anna,” Ms Kutepova said. “She was standing up to her chin in water and roaring, scaring away the bear.”  Rescuers arrived and managed to pull the woman free, as the exhausted grandmother muttered bear, bear. She was placed on a makesht stretcher and rushed to hospital. Anna, who is a retired railworker, has lived in the village all her le but claims there is a rise in the number of bear sightings within village grounds as wildfires and floods continue to rise.

But she has never felt any lesser by her unique looks and has been flaunting her beauty with confidence.

Although friendly and confident, she was often asked uncomfortable questions and teased and called names for her condition. But Mariana got confidence to face them from her mother who stood throughout as her biggest strength.

The footprints were discovered near to the isolated resort where Nora Quoirin, , vanished last weekend during a family holiday. Teams have been searching that area without any luck as the hunt for the missing Franco-Irish teen, who has special needs and is vulnerable, entered its sixth day on Friday. Forest trackers have been playing a recording of her mum Meabh pleading Nora darling, Nora I love you, mum is here as they walk through the jungle, hoping she will emerge from behind a tree or rock. Noraaposs family believe she was abducted from the holiday cottage at the Dusun resort, while police have said there is no evidence she was kidnapped and they believe she is still in the tropical rainforest after climbing out of a window.    Police have refused to rule out a criminal element as Noraaposs family remain hopeful she will be found alive during the search in Malaysiaaposs southern Negeri Sembilan state. An official involved in the search told reporters that several footprints believed to belong to Nora were found by a canine unit of the Fire and Rescue Department on Thursday, the New Straits Times reported. Assistant director Ahmad Mukhlis Mokhtar said teams focused on that area but found no further clues. He told reporters: “Previously, our detective canines had spotted footprints, but when we conducted a search there, we couldn’t find her.    Experts are already analysing fingerprints found at an open window in a downstairs hall of the cottage where Nora was staying with her parents, mum Meabh and dad Sebastien, and her two siblings. Deputy police chief Che Zakaria Othman previously said police have received the laboratory results of fingerprint samples taken from the Quoirin familyaposs accommodation. Investigations are still ongoing to identy who the fingerprints belong to. Mr Mukhlis said teams are optimistic Nora is still in the forest and hopeful that she will be found alive soon during a search that remains within four miles of the resort.  He said the operation would also focus on hills in the jungle because Nora could be hiding behind trees or rocks. Missing persons charity the Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting the Quoirin family, put up an urgent appeal for help from people in the capital Kuala Lumpur, about an hour from the resort. It wrote in a Facebook post on Friday: We urgently need flyers printed to distribute in and around Kuala Lumpur. Nora was staying in an upstairs room next to her siblings and was last seen when she went to bed on Saturday night, just hours after the jet-lagged family checked in following their arrival in Malaysia. Her father discovered her missing on Sunday at am, the family say.  Noraaposs mum is originally from Belfast and her father is from France.  The family, including Noraaposs younger brother and sister, live in London, and it is understood the teen was travelling on an Irish passport. The Quoirins were staying in one of the luxury resortaposs seven cottages during a two-week holiday. Mr and Mrs Quoirin believe Nora was abducted. The teen has learning and developmental disabilities, and has been described by family as vulnerable. More than  personnel are involved in the search, which has used drones equipped with thermal imaging technology, helicopters, snfer dogs, ers and local villagers who say the jungle is like their playground.  Teams have also played a recorded message from her mother on loudspeakers, hoping she would hear it and emerge. In the recording, her mum says: Nora darling, Nora I love you, mum is here. Police chief Datuk Mohamad Mat Yusop told The Star that the missing -year-oldaposs family members are not part of the search operations for security reasons. Mr Mohamad said Nora was believed to have climbed out of her resort room window. An able-bodied or normal person would be weak by the fth day, and that is why we need to find the victim as soon as possible, he said.  Photos of Nora have been posted in the area and handed out at roadblocks. Search and rescue units have had to contend with poor weather conditions, including thick fog and torrential rain. Trees were blocking a road following a storm. Jim Gamble, a top child protection officer who investigated the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has been supporting Quoirin family after being contacted this week, it was reported. Celebrities have helped to raise awareness about Noraaposs disappearance and express support for her family. Irish boyband Westle, who performed in Malaysia on Thursday night, made an emotional appeal to their fans to help find the missing schoolgirl.  The Lucie Blackman Trust wrote on Facebook afterwards: We would just like to publicly thank Westle and Nicky Byrne for sharing the appeal at their concert in Kuala Lumpur last night. It is very much appreciated. Malaysian film and TV actress Fasha Sandha, , posted a copy of a missing persons poster on Instagram, where she has four million followers.

The tornado, reported to be of low intensity, surprised residents in the municipality of Fresnillo, in the north-central Mexican state of Zacatecas, and many of them recorded the meteorological phenomenon before sharing the footage online. The videos show the tornado in fields around the town, with a dark dust cloud forming where it hits the ground. It was considered by the Civil Protection as a category EFO, so that it was considered a high-intensity whirlwind or a tornado of low density. According to Civil Protection, the tornado reached speeds ranging from  to  kphbut it did not cause serious damage.  The authorities reported that this natural phenomenon was formed outside Jerez and went to the mountains of the community of Piedras, where it disintegrated. The National Centre of Disasters Prevention explained that the tornado is a funnel formed for two air masses with dferent temperatures, humidity and speed. The centre said: “It originates in the base of a storm cloud when two air masses with dferent temperatures, humidity and speed crash into each other forming a funnel that reaches the land.

She suffered a partially severed tendon in her foot after being bitten by a fish on the same beach which was closed last month after two young children were hurt. The -year-old Spaniard was injured around midday yesterday just moments after her five-year-old son had taken a dip in the sea. Doctors had to put a plaster cast on her leg up to the knee after she went to hospital and she spent the last day of her holiday on crutches. The drama happened at El Rebollo beach in Elche near Alicante, one of three beaches closed in mid-July in the town after a mystery fish bit two young children.    The youngsters, a seven-year-old and a -year-old, were hurt at nearby El Pinet beach but the red flag went up there as well as El Rebollo. The latest incident has been blamed on a bluefish, with town hall officials yesterday announcing they had captured the same type of fish at El Rebollo beach. They confirmed they had not stopped people going in the water after yesterday’s incident but had hoisted the yellow flag recommending bathers use precaution. The husband of the injured woman, who is from Valladolid in northern Spain but has not been named, told local paper Diario Informacion: “She suddenly felt great pain and the yell she let out frightened us all. “The skin on her foot had been torn and she was bleeding heavily. She said she felt like she’d been trapped in a snare.    “They didn’t operate on her but almost. A tendon in her foot was partially severed. “If it had been my five-old-year son or another child instead of my we, they would have lost part of their foot.” In June three beaches were closed temporarily in the Costa Blanca holiday resort of Benidorm after seven people were stung by Portuguese Men O’War and two of the jellyfish-like creatures were spotted. The first was found at Mal Pas beach, a little cove between the town’s main beaches, and the second was found at the popular Levante beach.

We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make. Young Finn Robertson has been excellent so far this campaign but his youthfulness may see him replaced by the more experienced Ness for this one.Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are key players but,Dundee go to a -- that’s likely to see one miss out – or McGowan moved further upfield.On the wings, McDaid and Todd may have done enough to earn their starting spurs.Danny Johnson’s three goals in two matches make him almost certain to start. Less certain is Andrew Nelson’s place after he was replaced at half-time on Friday, however.Injury and illness have hampered Craig Curran lately, though he is expected to be fit for Saturday.McGowan in behind Johnson could be McPake’s pick for this big early-season clash."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-anyone-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-elvis-presley-visits-prestwick-airport-pictures-glasgow-39-s-history","story":"A selection of images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency-services-dash-multi-vehicle-collision-m80-traffic-stops","story":"Partof the M has reopened after a five-vehicle crash ground the northbound route to a halt."},{"url":null,"title":"cake-baked-russian-granny-wins-flour-power","story":"TATIANA Camilleri baked a cake in honour of her Russian grandmother to win last nightrsquos final episode of Flour Power on the new BBC Scotland Channel."},{"url":null,"title":"university-glasgow-cleaners-back-industrial-action-unite-union-ballot","story":"CLEANERS at the University of Glasgow have voted in support of industrial action in an ongoing dispute over working conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"things-glasgow-bloc-party-tequila-tasting-platform-market","story":"Bloc Party, Summer Nights at the Kelvingrove Bandstand, Kelvingrove Park, Tomorrow"},{"url":null,"title":"derek-macdonald-planning-system-focuses-much-past-not-future","story":"Ourcompany is privileged to have been selected to manage a conversion of an exclusive property in the heart of Glasgowrsquos west end into luxury apartments.

The council has empowered and enabled the community at every stage in the design and brought them along with it.“Remarkably that process has been a very positive one and we’ve seen residents and community groups in the area relish the opportunity to shape their next chapter of the community.“Long, long ago, people would have said that Tillydrone doesn’t get the facilities it deserves.“But over the next couple of weeks people will come in by the hundreds,not thousands, and they will tell you something dferent – that this is what Tillydrone deserves and Tillydrone’s actually got it. vw, px\"  “So for me personally as a resident who has lived here for most of my le, but as a councillor as well, it’s super inspiring to see it all come to fruition.”The opening of the hub marks only the beginning for the regeneration of the community, according to its ward councillor.Mr Grant said: “It’s just the first stage in the plans for the area because there is phase two which is wider work to the buildings around about.”The first look was held just two weeks before several days of activities take place to mark the official opening. vw, px\"  These include a fun day for families on Tuesday August , with a programme of activities, taster sessions and information sessions on Wednesday August  and Thursday August .This will conclude with the official opening on Friday August , including singing from Riverbank Primary pupils.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said the hub was going to be a “fabulous facility” for the people of Tillydrone.She added: “It was very important to us when we were making the investment in the building, that they were heavily involved in how that building evolved and the types of services that would be provided in it.“I think we’ve got a wonderful example here of providing both library facilities, nursery facilities, alongside space for activities, classes and learning.“But also it gives people the opportunity to come together in a central location in Tillydrone with the wonderful cafe facilities in the foyer, and meet with friends and family.”Aberdeen City Council has committed £. million towards the complex, while a further £. million grant has been received from the Scottish Government’s Regeneration Capital Grant fund."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust. Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

But they didn#t dampen the spirits of the Scouts who were presented with numerous awards including Bronze, Silver and Gold Chief Scout Awards.The highlight of the evening was the presentation to Martha Payne of her Diamond Chief Scout Award, the second highest award in Scouting.

Ardrishaig Bothy was open and help was on hand to introduce youngsters to riding a bike, or brush up on their cycle control skills. There was also a unique opportunity to join the th Duke of Argyll on a walking tour of the Crinan Canal as he uncovered the Chronicles of Crinan, butthat was too energetic then there was the option of sitting back to be entertained.Mid Argyll Pipe Band took time off from competition to play to the crowds. They joined some local bands who made sure toes were tapping from early morning until the end of the day.Of course, the main event was the ribbon cutting to formally open the Egg Shed and let the crowd who had gathered in Pier Square get a first look at the much-anticipated new building. Scottish Canals Chief Executive Catherine Topley together with Chief Executive of Argyll and Bute Council Cleland Sneddon addressed the crowd before enlisting the help of some young local helpers to help cut the ribbon and allow the first guests to flood in.As well as learning more about ‘Britain’s most beautul shortcut’, and its souvenir shop, the Egg Shed hosts a multi-purpose community space, free for the local community to use, which has a multitude of uses. It currently hosts an exhibition of Crinan Canal paintings by artist Richard Demarko, who when asked how he would describe them said they were: ‘a love letter to the Crinan Canal.’Mid Argyll Councillor Dougie Philand attended the launch and said: #It was a very well organised event and well attended. It sends out the signal that not only Scottish Canals but other partners are interested and are now investing in Ardrishaig. Long may this continue in order to regenerate the village back to the splendour it once enjoyed.#Councillor Donnie Macmillan, who also attended said: #I had a wonderful day at the opening of The Egg Shed. I would like to congratulate everyone who helped to make it a professional and successful day. Everyone involved played their part in a professional manner.#I hope this is an important part of the regeneration of Mid Argyll and I will continue to give them all my support in my duties as a councillor.#The Egg Shed is the latest marker in the regeneration of Ardrishaig Harbour and has already been taken to the community’s heart.

to new Deposit Return scheme.Thousands of plastic bottles and cans could be kept out of the environment in the Scottish Borders due to a pioneering new lsquomoney backrsquo system that will encourage people to recycle more and litter less.Figures published by environmental body Zero Waste Scotland, revealed the scale of plastic bottle dumping in the Scottish Borders.And how it will be reduced by Scotlandrsquos forthcoming depositscheme.Every year, people in the Scottish Borders go through . million plastic bottles.And an estimated , of those plastic bottles are littered around the Borders each year.Under the new scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic, glass bottles, and aluminium or steel cans.People will then get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.That p is hoped to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials mentioned.This would mean nearly , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Scottish Borders each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.Jill Farrell, Chief Operating Officer, Zero Waste Scotland said: ldquoOur new figures reveal how Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Borders.ldquoWe all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches.ldquoAnd the great thing about Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles, take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.ldquoLitter isnrsquot just an eyesore ndash it also pollutes our environment and seas.ldquoAnd for every bottle littered, more plastic must be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions.ldquoWhen you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, yoursquoll not just be getting your p back, yoursquoll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.All types of drinks in containers between  ml and  litres in size are included in the Deposit Return scheme.Across Scotland, wherever people can buy a drink in a container made from one of these materials, they will also be able toit to reclaim the deposit.Online retailers will also be included in the scheme, ensuring

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

students attended for a full day, completing work on the yard, riding lessons, and a small amount of cabin based activities.\"As with every new venture there are teething problems, however our students engaged and worked their way through them.\"Feedback from families and referring agencies commented on the growth of confidence of the young people.\"They developed from a very quiet group of

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march. We bear witness to the huge value of the United Kingdom.  Our #Thin Red Line# stands for everyone who likes being British, who likes the UK, and who wants us to stay together.#A group from Barrowfield at the Campbeltown cross ahead of the march.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

But it also offers a great opportunity for Scottish nationalists,Nicola Sturgeon has the determination to exploit it.Dominic Grieve yesterday told SkyNews that a signicant number of Tory rebels are preparing to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP this autumn in a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnsons government,the PM tries to force a no-deal departure from the EU. They will almost certainly win this vote since Mr Johnson has a majority of only one.:Iain Macwhirter: Brexit will spur decade of change for HolyroodThe PMs controversial consiglieri, Dominic Cummings, has of course seen this coming. Hes told colleagues that the governments response to the vote of no confidence will be to force a general election ndash ldquothe people versus politicians ndash but delay the election date until after the UK has left the EU on st October. That would make a hard Brexit a fait accompli. The health minister, Matt Hancock, says it is now impossible to stop no deal.Oh no it isnt, says Dominic Grieve, a former Attorney General. In that situation, parliament will simply have to ldquoreplace the government. He is proposing a legislative coup, using parliamentary votes to wrest control from Number Ten and request another extension from Brussels. In effect, Britain could have not one, but two governments wrestling for power as the country crashes out of the European Union on Halloween.Remainers are resolute, but the Johnson administration has the power of possession. Parliament is sovereign in our system, but it is hard to see how MPs could prise Boris Johnson out of Number Ten. The idea of parliamentary officers, led by the Sergeant at Arms, ordering the Prime Minister out of his new home at sword-point is a compelling image, but it isnt going to happen.Boris Johnson controls the cabinet: a band of ultra-Brexit ministers who are under oath to carry through Brexit, ldquodo or die, on the st. They will not back down. These Branch Borisians are prepared to go the full Waco and be immolated in the flames of no dealnecessary.So, is Scotland to be consumed also  When Nicola Sturgeon talked about ldquomaterial changes in circumstances justying a second independence referendum she could scarcely have dreamed of this. A Prime Minister, defying the will of the UK parliament, dragging Scotland to disaster.The idea of waiting around for a Section  order, which will certainly be refused, now seems laughable. Nor is it going to be enough for Nicola Sturgeon to repeat vague promises of a new road map to independence sometime in the future.The demand from her party, and the independence movement, will be for resolute action by the Scottish Government to defend Scotland from what will be called a Brexit dictatorship.Increasingly, SNP supporters are asking: what would Alex Salmond do  Well, he wouldnt have started from here, thats for sure. The former SNP leader was a charismatic insurgent, a revolutionary even. He would likely have been leading those rolling independence demonstrations weve been seeing in Scotland over the past  months ndash the largest in Scottish history ndash which Nicola Sturgeon inexplicably disowned.Alex Salmond would have used them as a , Catalan-style, to launch rhetorical missiles at the Brexit government. You can almost hear him:ldquoTheresa May said now is not the time. Well, Scotland says now IS the time to stand against the Johnson Junta in Westminster. Show this Feckless Franco that Scotland will not be driven off the Brexit clf by this demeaning diktat.:Ruth Davidson warns Johnson of threat to Union after swing to YesAs Brexit day approaches he would call for Scots to take to the streets in an unprecedented show of popular resistance. The Scottish parliament would be convened in emergency session to demand a repeat referendum on independence. He would likely argue that, since parliamentary democracy has been suppressed in Westminster, it must be honoured in Scotland. Holyrood is the only parliament left with the democratic authority to hold a referendum, the mandate for which has been in place since .Of course, this could all end in tears. The latest Ashcroft poll indicates that support for independence is now over  per cent, but theres no guarantee that an unauthorised second referendum would be won. Unionists would boycott it and Number Ten would call it meaningless. However, Salmond might be content to see the result rejected peremptorily by this unpopular Tory government. If nothing , it could help win the SNP a landslide in the  elections.But this is to ride the tiger of rebellion, and Nicola Sturgeon does not favour the politics of the street. The First Ministers preference might rather be to lend SNP support to a national coalition government in Westminster, of the kind being proposed by thecolumnist, Polly Toynbee.It is of course theoretically possible for Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Tory rebels and the SNP to put together a crisis administration for the sole purpose of avoiding no deal, or revoking Article . However, it seems unlikely that this unelected national government would fly, eventhe fractious opposition parties could be persuaded to come together long enough to form one.MPs may win votes in parliament, but they do not control the civil administration, cannot table legislation and can only briefly seize the parliamentary timetable. Parliament gives authority to a government, but it cannot rule in its place. That requires a general election. Nor is it clear that Brussels is going to ride to the rescue. Ring us when you see sense, was their response to the UKs latest call to drop the Irish backstop.So, as the Brexit deadline looms, Britain is likely to be in the kind of constitutional turmoil normally associated with unstable African states. Both the Scottish and UK parliaments will be in open revolt against a Prime Minister whose authority rests solely on the strength of his own ego.Nicola Sturgeon is a cautious lawyer who does not like to live dangerously.

The CHP engine generates heat for the public buildings and electricity for the sewage plant and the waste water heat pumps.The heat from waste water technology, provided by SHARC Energy Systems, uses a heat recovery unit to separate liquid and solid waste, which is ed to the treatment process.A heat exchanger transfers the heat from the waste water to the clean water using a closed loop system.A heat pump increases the temperature of the water, which is then delivered to the district heat network.The average temperature of the heat in waste water is between  and  degrees centigrade.The heating network will include the Peak Leisure Centre, Forthbank Stadium, St Modanrsquos High School and organisations such as Zero Waste Scotland and Volunteer Scotland.Scottish Water chief executive Douglas Millican said: ldquoSustainability is vital for homes, businesses and services, and using the energy from waste water is a great example of using resources to their maximum benefit.ldquoThis new scheme in Stirling will go a long way towards helping reduce our carbon footprint and protecting the environment.Leader of Stirling Council, Scott Farmer, said: ldquoMaking Stirling the first place in the UK to harness this mix of cutting-edge renewable technologies shows Stirling Council is determined to lead the way on tackling climate change by reducing our carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.ldquoThis innovative initiative will deliver cost-saving benefits to the council and residents, generate additional income for many years to come and benefit communities in the form of regeneration and jobs in the growing renewables sector.Several public and private sector organisations are working to wean Scotland off gas-only heating.:Prince Charles opens Scotlandrsquos biggest ever offshore wind farmElectric heat pumps ndash essentially reverse fridges ndash are being developed on an industrial scale across the planet.In Clydebank, local authorities hope to use pumps to capitalise on the relative warmth of the local river to heat a new neighbourhood.

Invisibly, some men ndash and presumably some women looking at men ndash are applying this test to everything: is what Irsquom doing man or non-man, girly or non-girly This obviously applies to the subject of crying as well. A few days ago, I was speaking to the historian and writer Alistair Moffat about his new book, To The Island of Tides, and he told me about a little incident in his le that has stuck in my headAlistair was walking on his farm in the Borders with his young granddaughter Grace when they spotted a plane overhead, its undercarriage lit by the low sun. Little Grace looked up at the plane and waved at it and there was something about her action that moved her grandfather to tears.I asked Alistair was it was about that moment that got to him and he wasnrsquot sure. Perhaps, he said, it was something about his granddaughterrsquos innocence or the dference in scale between the tiny toddler and the huge machine in the sky, but what was particularly interesting was what Alistair said about crying more generally. It had taken him a long time to learn how to do it, he said. He grew up on a council estate. He played rugby for Kelso. He was a boy. If you cried, you were told to stop.ldquoJessie was the word that was used, he said. ldquoStop bubbling, yoursquore being a jessie. But you have to unlearn it. You shouldnrsquot choke things down or stle them.I agree with Alistair and have always worried about the influence words like jessiehave had, and continue to have, over Scottish men. Children are taught by the people who stand by their cribs and at the front of their classrooms, consciously or unconsciously, that crying is feminine and that remaining dry-eyed is masculine and, later in le, boys and men apply that test to every other activity.

For years, Scotlandrsquos first minister was Alex Salmond, that alpha among alphas, but take a look too at some of the hyper-masculine language thatrsquos used in the arguments for independence. Take back our freedom! Smash the union! Be brave Scotland! Donrsquot be a jessie Scotland! The results of the  referendum also seem to show, unsurprisingly, that a campaign led by an alpha male and expressed in masculine language is more likely to attract men than women ndash  per cent of men voted yes in , but  per cent of women voted no.Nicola Sturgeon is probably aware she needs to change all of this and readjust the messageshe is to attract more women to her cause, but so far shersquos been unable, or unwilling, to do so. The other problem is that the ways many Scottish men have learned to behaveare hard to change. Those old male traits, the fear of looking feminine, the fear of carrying a reusable shopping bag, are deep down in the subcutaneous layers of their personalities. Good luck with trying to sht them.Perhaps there are a few men who are immune to it all, but not me. Like Alistair Moffat, I was often told as a child to stop crying like a girl, and Irsquove struggled to ignore the advice ever since.But I cry. I cried at the death of my cat Harry, and his brother Samuel. I cried when I read a poem to my friend Elaine at her wedding, and when a Spitfire pilot in his s told me about his experiences in the Battle of Britain. I also cry when Christopher Plummer sings Edelweiss in The Sound of Music and when Tom Baker regenerates in his last episode of Doctor Who.You can call all of that, or some of it, sillyyou like. You can even call me a jessie. But my response would be: I will do my best to resist. I will try to unlearn what Scotland taught me. I will spiralise vegetables. I will use my bag-for-le."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-labour-no-longer-stands-scotland","story":"I am a Scot and a European and I am an internationalist. One of the things internationalism needs is nations.No member of the SNP requires lessons on internationalism from the Labour Party in Scotland, which was founded on the back of a claim for Scottish independence and which has betrayed its claim to internationalism by Tony Blairs wars and its insular protectionism over Europe and now its failure to unequivocally seek to claw down Boris Johnsons dangerous Government with his obvious desire to enrich tax haven friendsat the expense of the British economy.There was a time when I would have been proud to be British but that has long gone, buried in the current English xenophobia and the failure of too many English politicians to realise that \"English\" and \"British\" are not synonyms.There was a time when Labour politicians stood up for the people of Scotland. Now they support Tory Unionism. I can understand the Tory Party in Scotland. Wallace, Bruce and our Thrie Estaitis found out that guile and gold can always buy its portion of the vote. There is, however, no excuse for the Scottish Labour Party, except to assume that its leaders have succumbed to the same venal ambitions as their Tory pals.KM Campbell, Doune.I HAVE just watched a TV clip of the wretched Richard Leonard, leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, relating how he explained to John McDonnell that the people of Scotland do not want a second independence referendum and how the SNP had promised that the first independence referendum would be a \"once in a generation\" event. This is two days after Lord Ashworths poll had indicated that a majority of Scottish voters now favoured independence and this is the same Richard Leonard who, when asked how he would vote in the event of a second EU referendum, replied that he would vote Remain but that he would not campaign for a second EU referendum as he had no right to seek to overturn \"the will of the people\". That from a member of the Scottish Parliament, elected to represent the people of Scotland who had voted overwhelmingly to remain.Nobody should be pigeon-holed on account of their accent or birthplace but his reference to \"the will of the people\" suggests that Mr Leonard, unlike myself and countless others, feels no sense of Scottish nationality. As for the \"once in a generation\" quote ndash that was one remark plucked from thousands of discussions during the referendum campaign by opponents of independence and was never presented as a policy statement by anyone on behalf of the SNP or any other organisation. I dont remember seeing any reference on the ballot paper to a \"once in a generation\" referendum.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WE live in a political age of deliberate ambiguity or more bluntly politicians lying, obfuscating or changing their principles on a Groucho Marx basis ndash \"If my principles dont support my arguments I have others\".We have Scottish Labour working for a second Brexit referendum but opposing a second independence referendum. In a quiet news period John McDonnell stating the obvious about a democratic majority leading to a second referendum makes headlines . The squirming of Ian Murray MPtrying to justy this Janus approach in interviews would make it to comedy on the Fringe.Ruth Davidson has already conceded this mandate for a second independence referendum when she said in June: \"If she [Nicola Sturgeon] puts it in a manesto that shes going to hold another referendum and she wins a majority outright, then she can negotiate with the UK Government in the same way as happened last time.\" Ms Davidsons response to Wednesdays news about Labour supporting her position was that she \"will always stand up for the United Kingdom\". That may play well with ultra-Unionists but less so with the majority of Scottish Conservatives who put Scotlands best interests first but also conclude Scotland benefits most by progressive devolution within the UK.What is apparent is that Scottish branches of both Labour and Conservatives are on a dferent page to their federal organisations and on a path to their own independence. That can only be good for Scotland.James Robb, Helensburgh.IS there room, one must wonder, for another spineless politician or two in Nicola Sturgeonrsquos back pocket  She has already the hapless and obedient Patrick Harvie resident there, but I am sure John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn could be squeezed inshe tried.I am thankful my staunchly Labour and long-dead father did not live to see this day.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.COUNCILLOR Alasdair Rankinrsquos letterhelps to highlight the plight of the less well-off in society, who as Cllr Rankin highlighted, pay taxes in ious ways including  per cent VAT. For low earners this VAT represents a much greater burden on their lower incomes than those with much more disposable wealth. The Scottish Government in introducing \"progressive taxation\" is clearly aiming to tackle the disproportionate burden on the lowest earners by asking higher earners to pay a little more. Progressive taxation is the only way forward for any society aiming to become a socially just society.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.SCANNING the anti-independence correspondence in these Brexit days and months Irsquom a wee bitty confused.Now my late, very late, history teacher made us consider then categorise the reigns of past kings and queens as ldquoGood or Bad Things.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sales will be licensed from August   until October  . This short trial period takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said: #We are delighted to announce Scotland-wide sales of resident greylag goose meat for a short trial period. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. The overall number of geese will be maintained at a healthy, sustainable population.

Understandably, she declared there was “growing urgency” for Scotland to become independent because it faced being “dragged down a political path we don’t want to go”.Cue much licking of SNP lips at thoughts of a No Deal disaster, sweeping gains at a General Election as Scottish Labour’s tailspin turns into a screaming e, victory in a second independence vote next year and,the last prospectus was anything to go by, the  Scottish parliament elections to be for the first independent Scottish legislature. But some pro-independence commentators have begun to question the assumption that Boris Johnson is a gt and a No Deal departure will be the best precursor to separation. It is unquestionably true that the SNP does not want a No Deal exit, but then neither does the UK government, but is a soft Brexit like that agreed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May really a path Ms Sturgeon doesn’t want to do down For the SNP, it could be the best of both worlds: it would still be Brexit, so Scotland will have been “dragged out the EU against its will” but with customs and regulations aligned the UK would have to play by EU rules over which it had no control. Under those circumstances the SNP would argue an independent Scotland back in the EU would give Scotland a say and with no adverse effect on rUK trade.No Deal is the reverse, where an independent Scotland going back into the EU would mean trade barriers, virtual or otherwise, where none currently exist because automatic harmonisation will have ended and the Irish question becomes the Scottish question. With four times as much Scottish trade going to the rest of the UK than to Europe, whatever the economic impact of the UK leaving the EU it would be four times as greatScotland left the UK.These febrile times are leading to a loss of grip and perspective, like Labour’s John McDonnell who promised yesterday that Labour would let the Scottish parliament decide whether there should be a second independence referendum, which it already has, even referring to Westminster as the “English parliament”. In one-garrulous Fringe chat show, Scottish Labour’s election pledge is now for Indyref , much to the dismay of Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray.Even in the parliamentary recess, the momentum towards an autumn election is accelerating because with no sign of European willingness to renegotiate the alternatives are a new parliament and a change of government or a No Deal departure on October .With his working majority down to one, the chances of a No Confidence vote when Westminster reconvenes in September are high, but Mr Johnson is not compelled to call an election and instead has  days to demonstrate he can form a new government which commands a majority. Onlythat fails must an election be called, so it is not unfeasible for an election to be after October  by which time the UK will have left the EU without a deal.The Conservative position of honouring the results of the  and  referenda and opposing re-runs of both has the benefit of consistency and for the sake of the Union Scottish Conservatives have no alternative but to get right behind the UK government and be ready for November .

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"uk teetering on brink of recession as economy shrinks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Gross Domestic Productfell by . per cent between April and June, according to the Office for National Statistics .The economy was weaker than both market expectations and the Bank of Englands latest forecasts, which had pointed to flat growth in the quarter.: Brexit: Boris Johnson to create fast-track visa route for foreign scientistsRob Kent Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: \"GDP contracted in the second quarter for the first time since  after robust growth in the first quarter.\"Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UKs original departure date from the EU.\"The construction sector also weakened after a buoyant beginning to the year, while the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all.\"The contraction compares to . per cent growth in the previous quarter, when the highest quarterly pickup in manufacturing since the s was recorded.The ONS said companies had been building up additional goods in the first quarter in anticipation of a March Brexit.But with the original deadline later called off in favour of an October exit, firms which spent the first three months of the year stockpiling look to have been using up their stores before building up new reserves.: Former head of news at BBC Scotland to chair salmon producersrsquo groupLabour MP David Lammy tweeted: \"Two weeks into Boris Johnsons hard Brexit government and we are now officially halfway towards a recession.

Our . percent budget deficitexceeds EU limits , implying spending cuts tax hikes of around £ billion per year from a total budget of £- billion.We shall face years of austerity, at the end of which we shall adopt the euro and hand over control of our economy and trade, fishing and agriculture to Brussels. ‘Hasta la vista’, independence!Scots will never vote for that.The obvious antidote is to join EFTA, instead of the EU. But that isn’t the policy being peddled to voters. Ms Sturgeon recently confirmed SNP intentions to rejoin the EU on the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show. The policy is unsustainable humbug and it will change before any independence referendum takes place.The problem is Mr Tulloch is you live in a British mindset when it comes to economics and is very much accepting of the present way of government of Scotland .Proactive governments like Norway, Ireland and Iceland run their government and countries a lot dferent from Westminster and have for example a lot higher g.d.ps or bigger economiesthan we have at the moment, Ireland a hundred years ago was an integral part of the British state ,a rural backwater a neo military junta .Today#s economy an open modern European nation is something to be proud of with a g.d.p of  compared to the U.K  or it#s North east of Ireland of dollars.O the JUSTICE of it.Mr Salmond#s  #Declaration of Lerwick# promised new powers for Shetland.

Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland, and the revenue generated from these assets, will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. This will include the Crown Estate’s seabed, urban assets, rural estates, mineral and fishing rights, and the Scottish foreshore for which it is responsible.#. Following this transfer, responsibility for the management of those assets will be further devolved to local authority areas such as Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eilean Siar or other areas who seek such responsibilities…….#Perhaps, Ms Sturgeon will update us on progress, four years on What a great advert for the SNP!!!!# One of the worst education systems according to the international measurement last published.Nicola Sturgeon, albeit unwittingly, chose to wear a Barbour jacket during her brief visit to Shetland.

He was speaking at an NFU meeting in the Lerwick Hotel.Asked about a Tory threat to the minimum wage protection that was in place for agricultural workers, he said he didn’t hold with a minimum wage workers should be free to accept as low a wage as was offered.Their “freedom” was to be exploited.Back then LibDems opposed Labour’s plan to extend the minimum wage on principle. Something to do with their backing from small businesses.Of course they changed their minds once it was clear it was going to happen.A bit like Tavish backing the right of women to join the Royal and Ancient golf club at St. Andrews, after they’d let them in.So the clash between securing the freedom of iniduals and that of business is resolved by sitting on a fence and waiting for a strong wind.What is Liberalism Whose round is it Another classic cock-up from the SNP!

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

annual Féile an Phobail, the visual arts programme continues to attract record numbers through its doors at its base in St Mary’s University College.This year’s programme is packed full of exhibiting artists and groups represented throughout Ireland and worldwide through a range of mediums and topics including paintwork, sculpture and installations.Artists on display range from Aidan Monaghan, Andrew Whitson, Micheál Gallagher, acclaimed music photographer Conor Kerr and David Bell.Féile Operations and Events Co-ordinator Áine McCabe described the week-long event as “one that people don’t want to miss”.“I recently joined Féile, just after Christmas, and it’s been a baptism of fire,” she laughed. “Having been involved with Féile for many years, whether as a participant or volunteer, it’s a completely dferent ball game seeing behind the scenes and what goes in year on year to put the festival on in all its guises.“We have Deirdre Mackel and Micheál Gallagher working for months to bring together the exhibition, to bring together the dferent genres of art and it’s great to see so many repeat artists coming back. It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying.

The Equality Commission has said a portrait of the Queen is not considered by it to be a sensitive item for display in a workplace in its guidelines. However, chief commissioner Michael Wardlow has stressed that the context of how it was displayed was key and could possibly lead to causing offence and disrupting workplace harmony. Lord Maginnis said that unionist public representatives \"would also like to hear from the civil servant who complained and received thousands of pounds in compensation\".The peer added: \"Why was he hurt or offended  What prompted his complaint \"Lord Maginnis said unionists also wanted to knowMr Hegarty was the only person to have been compensated after complaining about the royal portraits. The DUP has voiced its support for Mr Smiths review and has raised the removal of the portraits with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson last week said: \"It is entirely appropriate that as Her Majestys Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, he would see no dficulty with portraits of the Queen being displayed here in Belfast. \"We should ensure that displays such as Her Majesty are able to take place, recognising the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. \"In other embassies and Government buildings across the world, there will be pictures of the head of state on display. \"This is appropriate and such a display should therefore be the same for Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.\""},{"url":null,"title":"administrators allow extra week to explore bids for harland and wolff","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry motocross racer owes great deal air ambulance","story":"A Co. Derry motocross racer is one of many patients who are grateful for the rapid response of the Air Ambulance.Eoghan Kerlin from Dungiven was taking part in a quad motocross event in Cookstown in September  when he required medical assistance. He was out on the track and unfortunately went over a jump at the same time as another competitor and collided at speed.Eoghan came off his quad in the air, landing on his right-hand side as he attempted to clear the jump. His we Kerrie, who was at the event, immediately rang .Due to the nature of this incident and the high index of suspicion for potential injuries, the air desk paramedic who was monitoring this call spoke directly with Kerrie to gain further information. The air desk paramedic dispatched the air ambulance on the knowledge that Eoghan was badly injured and required immediate pre-hospital critical care interventions.A road ambulance was deployed and arrived shortly before the air ambulance. Eoghan had a seizure and was sedated by the HEMS team at the scene before being transferred by the air ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital.The Dungiven man’s injuries were all down the right side and he had an open fracture in his leg, his femur was shattered, and he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.Speaking about the accident, Eoghan’s we Kerrie said: “Standing on the side-lines and watching the accident was one of the worst moments I’ve ever experience, I really thought Eoghan was going to die.“Eoghan had a seizure at the scene which was incredibly frightening but when I saw the air ambulance coming into land my anxiety reduced. Within minutes of the HEMS team arriving, all the craziness seemed to calm, and I just felt so much more at easy as the team were so professional.”As part of his recovery, Eoghan visited the air ambulance base, and the home of the Air Ambulance Northern Irelandcharity, in Lisburn to meet the team who had helped him.He updated them on his recovery, saying: “I’m still undergoing treatment for my injuries and will have to have surgery on my kneecap which has unfortunately been damaged beyond repair. But I’m here and I’m on the road to recovery and every week there is further improvement.“I owe a great deal to all of the medical professionals who helped, and continue to help, me and I’m feeling positive about the future.”Kerrie added: “As a family, we know just how important the air ambulance service is and in recognition of this, we held a fundraiser in November last year and raised £, for the charity. We wanted to extend a heartfelt thanks to every single person who contributed in any way to help.“We are forever grateful for what AANI has done for us and couldn’t imagine what the outcome may have beenthey were not available.”The charity, AANI in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service , provides the Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicefor the region and responds to seriously ill or injured patients, seven days a week, for twelve hours a day.AANI requires £, per day to keep this vital service going, meaning £million must be raised each year.You can support the charity by joining Club AANI, an exclusive members club, for a weekly donation of £.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

But, there is no doubt that your body slows down. My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events. How would it go down with our visitors  Wersquod never done anything like this before.As it turned out, stomach butterflies were swtly replaced with full bellies.ldquoIt sold out very quickly and in the end there were lots of smiling faces and empty plates, Mr Gardiner said. ldquoThe only downside was that the volunteers didnrsquot have any leftovers to enjoy.Mr Gardiner reveals the preparation that went into the event.ldquoWe knew the food would be great. It was freshly prepared by Franck Breacuteteacutecheacute from Mange Tout, who we have worked with before on private charters mdash including my own th birthday party mdash and we were determined that this would look the part.ldquoWe scoured charity shops across the county to give forgotten but beautul old bone china tea sets a new lease of le, including fabricating  new cake stands from scratch using these lovely vintage finds ndash no modern off the shelf crockery for us.ldquoIt also marked an attempt to ersy our offering and attract more people to the railway and the local area than might otherwise come.Paula OrsquoNeill, along with her friends Natasha Mellon and Denise McGuinness, travelled from Ardee in Co Louth and gave the day the thumbs up.ldquoThe gluten free option was excellent mdash great iety and lovely presentation with plenty of options of drinks available. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend.Kim Mullholland, from Groomsport, said: ldquoThe railway team did great. Every one of the staff looked so happy to be attending to everyone which so often isnrsquot the case at these sorts of events. We were with my husbandrsquos parents who both enjoyed the afternoon very much.Danielle Beaver, from Armagh, arranged her visit as an anniversary gt for her husband, John.She said: ldquoWe had a fab time. Lovely atmosphere, great choice of teas and coffees ndash especially as we are tee-total. We didnrsquot feel left out at all. Lovely selection of food and cakes. We will be back.Owing to demand, another afternoon tea event will take place this Sunday at .pm.Tickets cost pound per head which, as well as the afternoon tea and drinks, includes all-day steam train journeys, access to all museum areas, and is inclusive of credit card and booking fees.Places are limited and pre-booking is required.

The group was also taken on a walking tour of Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch.The Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group also organised a charity garden party to enable the visitors to meet their friends from the Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas in an informal setting, which included the councilrsquos deputy chairman, Terry Andrews, and concluded with a rousing performance of La Marseillaise.Cllr Casey welcomed the French delegation with a reception at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch.He said: ldquoThe main objectives of the three-year plan of the twinning arrangement are to organise healthy activities and events, bring generations together in experiencing two fabulous cultures and share our heritage with partners from all over the south of Ireland, west of Scotland, Galacia in Spain, Wales, the Isle of Man and Brittany.ldquoAs part of our councilrsquos strategic objectives, we are striving to become a premier tourism destination on the island of Ireland, and empowering and improving the capacity of our communities.He told the visitors: ldquoThese objectives could not have been achieved without the continued support we have received from initiatives such as twinning arrangements.ldquoFrom visiting the area and investing in our local businesses, to bringing dferent cultural experiences to the citizens of our district through ious projects, I would like to thank you.He added: ldquoOur mission as a council is to lead and serve a district that is prosperous, healthy and sustainable.ldquoI am pleased to have you all here to celebrate the  years of this twinning arrangement.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down. They had a proud tradition and the opening of the new park was the fulfilment of a dream.The new park was blessed by Fr Charles Bready, PP, Loughinisland, Among those also presentwere Gerard McShane, East Down chairman T P Murphy, county secretary Harry McEvoy, Ulster Council delegate and Matt Fitzpatrick, county registrar.LISTOODER mdash Mr Thomas Steenson, who is leaving shortly to live in America, was the recipient of a specially inscribed Bible from Mr James Brownlee, Worshipful Master of Listooder Orange Lodge, at a dance in Listooder on Friday night..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gaelic championship fever erupts  ","story":"CHAMPIONSHIP fever will be sweeping through the county over the next five days.Reputations will be put on the line as all the sparring that has taken place throughout the league campaigns is replaced by an iron resolve to make a mark.The action gets underway tomorrow night with four games down for decision.Most interest will be focused on Pairc Esler with Clonduff taking on Saval in the SFC at pm. A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

Such has been Malachyrsquos dedication that on March  this year he was presented with an award from Newry, Mourne and Down Council for Outstanding Fundraising in aid of MRF.MRF fundraising and support officer Paula Donaghy said: ldquoOn behalf of MRF, I would like to thank Malachy, his family and all his collectors for their commitment and dedication.ldquoMalachy is an amazing man who has quietly organised and coordinated the collection for over  years and we are exceedingly grateful for his support. As a charity, we rely on the generosity and support of the local community to sustain our vital work.ldquoAll money raised will help us to continue to fund cutting-edge research into the prevention, detection and treatment of the disease, raise important awareness of the symptoms and support all those who have been affected.ldquoMalachy has been a fantastic support to the organisation and it is his hope that as he retires someone from the area will take over the coordination of the Annual Street Collection and carry on his legacy.Mrs Donaghy said meningitis was a deadly disease which acts fast and is hard to detect. It can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time.ldquoThe vision at MRF is of a world free from meningitis and septicaemia, she continued. ldquoA world where effective vaccinations can protect everyone. ldquoA world where people who do get the diseases get the most effective diagnosis and treatments possible. A world where people affected, and their families, have the best support and information.ldquoIn , around , people died of meningitis and it is estimated that over one million survived who now have to live with the after effects, such as limb loss or brain injury.ldquoFunds raised through street collections such as this one in Downpatrick go a long way towards helping MRF achieve these goals.Anyone who would like volunteer for the collection in Downpatrick on August  is asked to contact Dominic Doran on  , email dominicdoran@yahoo.For more information on meningitis and septicaemia, or the work of MRF, visit www.meningitis.org or telephone   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10183076.jpg","title":"bandstand usna","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

MagowanThe work undertaken by Portadown based AG Wilson Civil Engineering will see the area transformed to showcase the beautul surroundings of Gilford.And the company this week gave a sneak peak of the work carried out with a stunning video.Spearheaded by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, phase two of the Gilford Riverside Trail was funded with cash from the SOARVillage Renewal Measure.Walkers and cyclists across the Borough will soon have the chance to meander down a picturesque pathway alongside the beautul Bann River in Gilford, thanks to funding of £, from SOAR .Phase  was completed in  at Stramore Park and Phase  will connect these lands to Woodlands Park by the creation of an m riverside walking and cycling trail.The project has involved the creation of a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and the construction of a new footbridge across the millrace linking the trail to Woodlands Park.The route passes over part of the old mill race and land between the river and the in-filled mill pond.Sharing their video on social media AG Wilson said: “As the Gilford Riverside Trail project nears completion, we are excited to share a sneak preview of the works undertaken by AGW on behalf of ABC Council.”Keep up to date with the latest AG Wilson projects via their Facebook page on facebook,com agwilsoncivilsWarning over suspicious

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

While an operator for the hotel has not yet been announced, the group has developed a series of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK and Ireland, as well as Seraphine hotels.

Speaking earlier this year, Brian Kelly, a director at the project’s planning consultants, Turley said: “As part of the master-planning team for Titanic Quarter, Turley is very excited to be part of this exciting project. We are delighted that a leading UK hotel developer has chosen Titanic Quarter as its first location in Northern Ireland. “This major investment will support the area’s successful evolution into a world-class tourism destination, an international exhibition and conferencing location and a hub of local, national and international business and education.” And a spokesman for JMK Group said the project is “about making a strategic investment in Belfast’s tourism sector, meeting the increasing demand from families who see Belfast and Titanic Quarter as a family friendly destination”. “We believe that the growth of the tourist sector in Belfast and Northern Ireland has an exciting future.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/twitter.jpg","title":"ulster business top  northern ireland companies  to be unveiled","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by Ulster Business The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list for  is almost upon us.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
