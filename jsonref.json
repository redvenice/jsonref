Don\u0027t assume someone is mean. It\u0027s easy to demonize people.\u0027Earlier this week, Mr Musk suggested in emails to a BuzzFeed journalist that er Vernon Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027.Musk also claimed, without providing any evidence, that Mr Unsworth had moved to northern Thailand to take \u0027a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u0027The Tesla CEO\u0027s attacks on  Mr Unsworth, whose efforts were considered crucial to the Thai operation, came after the British er criticized a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the cave rescue effort.Mr Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile.

But because of the prices, the returns and the ratio I\u0027ve come out on top and made money from them, which they don\u0027t like.          Mr Sharpe, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, claims he has had his accounts restricted with bet365.com, Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power\u0027Now if I want a selection on the horses and I go for a horse that\u0027s 5-1 and I try and offer bet365 a tenner, the answer is no - maximum stake 33p.\u0027There\u0027s no point in me gambling with them anymore because it\u0027s for pennies and they won\u0027t shut you down completely because they want to show their shareholders that they have this many million users.\u0027Obviously it\u0027s their right to trade with whom they wish but as soon as you start winning, that\u0027s it.\u0027Mr Sharpe opened his account with bet365 closed in June this year, just five months after he opened it. He opened a Paddy Power account online in September only for it to be closed in December. With bet365, he has only won £1,500 over the last year with the single biggest pay-out being a £400 win after he placed £10 on a 33-1 horse.Yet the highest stake he can now place with the bookie is 33p.He believes he is being punished because the company has noticed that he frequently backs the early price for a horse to win before the odds have shortened.By routinely backing horses at 20-1 before the odds shorten, to say 5-1, means that even though he loses more times than he wins, he still makes money in the long-run.          Mr Sharpe is one of a number of punters across the country who have their accounts restricted by bookmakers like Ladbrokes, Coral and others to stop players \u0027who know what they\u0027re doingEstimates suggest that 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted in similar ways. They include members of the House of Lords. The limiting of winning players is such a regular part of sports betting in Las Vegas that professional gamblers will intentionally place wagers at less-advantageous odds to stay off the radar.Operators say scrutinising winners is necessary to help prevent fraud - but critics argue that it is damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. It is now becoming increasingly prominent in the UK and is such a concern that the matter has been debated in Parliament.Mr Sharpe conducted a survey among 150 regular gamblers which found that more than half of them had had their accounts restricted by bet365, Paddy Power and Betfair          Mr Sharpe (pictured) had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racingAnother gambler, Will Tomassi, 39, from Farnham, Surrey, makes an average profit of between £3,500 a month on betting.He had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racing.Mr Tomassi, who works in sales for a medical company, said: \u0027I was going great guns but then they pulled the rug from under me which was extremely annoying.\u0027bet365 are really the only company who offer decent early prices on the dogs and I betted on \u0027match-ups\u0027 which was essentially picking one dog to beat another dog in the race.\u0027I started with a £2 beginning stake, which rose to £15 the more successful I became, but crucially I could roll over my winnings to a second or third race.\u0027So if I did get to a third bet, I could be betting as much as £60.\u0027Since the account was restricted, the most I can place on a bet in match-ups at any one time is £1 so it\u0027s more or less null and void.\u0027I can play a singles game and pick a winner but even then it\u0027s only for small change.\u0027The problem is that if you apply any kind of intelligence or any intent to try and work anything out, they cut you off straight away.\u0027Earlier this year All-Party Parliamentary Betting and Gaming Group held a seminar at the House of Lords to discuss account closures and restrictions by online bookmakers on successful punters.  Estimates suggest that around 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted to maximum bets of 33p - or closed as a result of winning too may bets The group\u0027s chairman Philip Davies MP told MailOnline that at least one member of the Lords had had their account restricted but declined to name who.The group is urging the gambling industry to introduce a minimum bet rule – already in place at racecourse bookies – which would require a betting company to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, typically £500.Mr Davies said: \u0027I accept that it\u0027s impossible for bookmakers to let punters lay anything they want on because they\u0027d probably go bust in no time.\u0027But there\u0027s a big difference in that and restricting someone to bet only a few pence or a few pounds.\u0027This happens to a lot of people, I know of a member of the House of Lords who has had his account restricted, and I\u0027m sure the industry will say it\u0027s a very small proportion of punters\u0027The whole point of gambling, whichever side of the counter you\u0027re on, is that sometimes you\u0027ll win and sometimes you\u0027ll lose.\u0027That\u0027 the nature of it and I think too many gambling companies have become risk averse and if you want to be risk averse you shouldn\u0027t be in the gambling industry.\u0027Bookmakers have been far too restrictive in the past but credit where credit\u0027s due, they are starting to wake up and are slowly but surely moving in the right direction.\u0027bet365 has yet to make comment however a spokesman for Ladbrokes and Coral, which merged in November 2016, admitted that a small number of their accounts were restricted.A spokesman said: \u0027Over a million people bet regularly with Ladbrokes and Coral in our betting shops, online and via mobile apps, and over 99 per cent of bets are laid as requested.\u0027Only a small minority of our customers experience restrictions on certain bets for risk management purposes, as is the case with all bookmakers. We close very few accounts and a high proportion of these are for responsible gambling or anti-money laundering grounds or because they are duplicate accounts, rather than for trading reasons.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/17/05EF2233000007D0-6143751-image-a-78_1536336547059.jpg","title":"How Nike worth","story":"      Nike\u0027s 30th anniversary Just Do It advert features San Francisco 49er Colin KaepernickNikeFounded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, Nike started out as a distributor for the Japanese shoemaker Onitsuka Tiger, now known as Acics, before officially becoming Nike Inc in 1971. The company was founded by track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman and a middle-distance runner Phil Knight, from Portland.Business Insider reported that while Knight had planned to call the company Dimension 6, the name Nike was thought of by their first employee Jeff Johnson and comes from the Greek goddess of victory\u0027s name. 1971 was also the year that Bowerman had his first eureka moment while he was making waffles with his wife. Seeing the waffle iron sparked an idea for grooved patterns on the sole of trainers to help athletes grip the tracks while running and it was referred to as the Nike Waffle Trainer, patented in 1974.In addition to this, the iconic Nike swoosh logo was designed by Portland State student Carolyn Davidson for just $35, more than $200 in today’s currency, but she was later given stock that is now worth over $640,000.The Just Do It slogan was inspired by serial killer Gary Gilmore who had said ‘let’s do it’ before he was executed in 1977 by a firing squad. 11 years later, the first Just Do It campaign was launched, featuring Walt Stack, an 80-year-old runner.Nike was also the first company to use a Beatles song  in a TV commercial, their track Revolution featuring in the sporting giant’s 1987 ad for the Air Max shoes.            Colin Kaepernick kneels during the national anthem before an NFL game against the SeahawksNike adAs reported by Time, many have wondered how much Kaepernick’s deal with Nike could be worth, with some sports agents claiming it could be  millions of dollars a year, which would be a unique development considering he does not currently play for a team in the NFL.The Nike ad features the former player with a caption reading: ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt.’ Despite having signed Colin in 2011, Nike had not used him in over two years and the company agreed to an eight-year extension of the deal with the league in March.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s Vice President of Brand for North America said: \u0027We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation. We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce Just Do It to a new generation of athletes,’ adding  the campaign was aimed at those who were between 15 and 17.The full advert, which features Kaepernick for 20 seconds, concludes with the quarterback saying: \u0027So don\u0027t just ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they\u0027re crazy enough.\u0027 The caption at the end flashes: \u0027It\u0027s only crazy until you do it. Just do it.\u0027Nike boycottAfter the Nike advert was released, protesters on social media called for people to burn their Nike sneakers and boycott the retailer after choosing Kaepernick for its signature Just Do It campaign, with shares in the company initially plummeting.In addition to a number of social media users, actor James Woods joined the many who criticised Nike on Twitter, tweeting that he emailed his wealth manager asking him to sell all of his  shares.\u0027Please est my portfolio of all Nike stock in my personal account in and the plan. Henceforth never buy Nike stock for me again.\u0027 He followed up by tweeting out a meme mocking the Nike slogan, saying, \u0027Nike: Just Sold It.\u0027Nike stockDespite Nike stock having an uptick now, after the company released their 30th anniversary Just Do It campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, shares fell by two percent to $79.01 but have since recovered to $81.13 per share as of approximately 11:26am EST on Friday, September 7.According to CNBC calculations, if one invested $1,000 in 2008, it would now be worth $6,131.47.While it is not clear whether Kaepernick’s inclusion in the advert would affect Nike’s stock in the long term, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, said: ‘While Nike has been doing relatively well in a sports market that is under pressure, it cannot afford to make bad decisions.‘Anything which has the potential to damage market share, such as overtly political campaigns, should be avoided.’ However, Host of Mad Money Jim Cramer, pointed out that ‘if people think Colin Kaepernick is cool,’ then ‘it’s a win for Nike.’It is estimated that Nike generated $43 million in free advertising through media coverage when the campaign collaboration with Kaepernick was first revealed at the start of the week, despite the backlash.Nike worthAccording to Statista, Nike’s global net income in 2018 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is a significant drop from $4.2 billion last year and what seemed to be a steady growth from 2009 onwards.Forbes reported that Nike was the world\u0027s leading athletic apparel maker and has a brand value of $15.9 billion. In addition to this, it increased its revenue to $24 billion from $16 billion in five years.Nike\u0027s share of the footwear market rose from 14 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period and expanded its presence in international football, as well as professional and college sports.  Prince Harry has worn the same bracelet for 20 years and this is whyFortnite Monopoly: When is it released and how is it different from the traditional board game?Who is Joe Rogan?

I decided to put this into practice with patients referred to me by care homes, and I was astounded by the response of some of them.After only a few days of regular paracetamol, I was able stop all the anti-psychotic drugs prescribed for one lady. Paracetamol became my first-line treatment for agitation in elderly patients.But paracetamol isn’t the answer for everyone. Skilled nursing care is the missing factor in the tragic plight of so many dementia patients.Just because someone is unable to articulate how they are feeling or what is wrong, doesn’t mean they are not communicating.Non-verbal communication and subtle changes in demeanour can provide a wealth of information about the patient — but it takes experience and time spent with them to pick up on this.I was once called to see an elderly man with dementia in a nursing home. ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there’s a problem,’ his nurse said. He knelt down and gently took the man’s hand. ‘You can tell from his face. See . . .?’All I saw was an elderly man with his mouth wide open and expressionless eyes, utterly shut off from the world. Then his lip curled very slightly.‘There,’ the nurse said triumphantly. ‘He does that now and again when he’s hungry or thirsty, but he’s been doing it a lot for a few days now’.I wasn’t convinced, but realised the nurse knew his patient so well that he recognised minute, idiosyncratic changes in facial expression indicating a problem.However, after examining the patient I could find nothing wrong. The nurse continued to insist the opposite was true, so I arranged for the man to be admitted to hospital for a full investigation.He was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that had spread to his kidneys — and which must have been causing him acute pain. But thanks to his relationship with an empathetic nurse he didn’t have to sit there and suffer for long.Sadly, this type of patientnurse relationship is all too rare in the modern NHS and even in many care homes because of staff shortages, high turnover and a pressured environment.As a result society’s most vulnerable must suffer in silence.    DUMBING DOWN JUST WON\u0027T WORKThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has had a brainwave! Patients would be more engaged in their treatment if they were written to in language that avoided medical terminology — rather than copied in on a letter to their GP — after a specialist consultation.I tried it a few years ago but it wasn’t a success. It doubled my workload because I still had to record everything formally in the medical notes rather than rely on a letter to cover everything adequately. Nor did my patients like it. Quite rightly, they seemed to prefer medical professionals communicating with each other about their health, rather than via them in a dumbed-down letter that risked missing key details.Medical terminology and jargon is a language that’s evolved to communicate precise, complex things in as clear and unambiguous way as possible to others who speak that language.Most patients realise receiving a copy of such a letter is a courtesy, but it isn’t intended to explain things to them. That should be done face to face by the doctor during the appointment, and the patient encouraged to ask questions or seek clarification.To me, this interaction is the bedrock of good doctor-patient relationships. Firing off patronising missives to our patients is no substitute.   OLD AGE, NEW TAX!The crisis in social care is not going away. Latest figures from the charity Age UK show 1,000 elderly people are admitted to hospital every day simply due to a lack of adequate social care.I know too well how patients can languish on medical wards, waiting for the social care to be put in place so they can return to their own homes, or for a care home place to be found.It is grossly unfair on patients and puts them at risk of infections and a general deterioration in health: increasingly immobile and lacking the mental stimulation of a non- hospital environment.It is also a shameful waste of much-needed NHS beds. Calling the old and frail ‘bed blockers’ is distasteful, but through no fault of their own that’s what they are. The Government’s social care green paper this autumn will set out plans for addressing this escalating crisis. But the harsh truth is ministers have few options. The system desperately needs more cash and I’m afraid tax-payers must cough up.The alternative is a social care system not fit for purpose, that compromises the efficient functioning of the NHS, denies many the medical care they need and lets down the elderly.I dislike the idea of extra tax, but I dislike even more the idea of inadequate care when I’m old and infirm.A social care tax — ring-fenced so it isn’t subsumed by other expenditure — would let us start building the sort of 21st-century care system expected of the world’s sixth largest economy.If we don’t, then as former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said (albeit in a very different context): ‘I warn you not to grow old’   WHY DOES THE STIGMA OF HIV STILL LINGER?New cases of HIV are at their lowest level for nearly 20 years. This is in large part due to new therapies, including drugs that prevent someone who is HIV positive passing on the virus.It’s also thanks to PrEp (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a combination of two anti-HIV medicines that are taken daily and which protect someone who may be at high risk of exposure to HIV.It’s a truly seismic shift in the management of a disease that, when I started training to be a doctor in the late Nineties, was still considered a death sentence. Now, men and women infected with HIV and who have access to the best medication can expect to live as long as someone without the virus.Unfortunately, there has been no accompanying shift in public perception of the disease.We still make moral judgments about those who are HIV positive. We still regard infection as some sort of retribution for a debauched or hedonistic life.This contributes to the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and I believe it’s a factor in the significantly higher rates of mental health problems in HIV positive iniduals.For many newly-diagnosed, fear of being ostracised haunts them. So it’s no wonder rates of depression among the HIV positive are nearly ten times higher than in the general public.How sad that, despite incredible scientific advances that have enabled us to conquer HIV, we’ve reached the stage where it is society’s attitude rather than the virus itself that ensures HIV remains a feared diagnosis.  One in four student nurses quits before their course ends, according to new figures. Yet we face a shortfall of 40,000 nurses. It’s an absolute crisis. Nurses are frontline deliverers of care. Without enough, the NHS will collapse. This cannot continue. We can recruit more nurses from overseas — but we also need home-grown nurses, and there IS a simple solution. Abolish tuition fees for nursing degrees, and reinstate the student nurse grant. It would send a clear message that we value our nurses and are grateful for their vocation. If retention rates don’t improve, I fear we will live to regret it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/01/4FDBE4F200000578-0-image-a-18_1536365042407.jpg","title":"Facebook issues apology removing nude Cosmo photos Burt Reynolds tribute posts","story":"    Facebook issued an apology after the above photo from Burt Reynolds\u0027 Cosmo centerfold was removed from tribute posts           Facebook users complained that they were told the image violated community standards on nudity           Facebook automatically flagged the image and then removed it saying it was under review           One user called out Marc Zuckerberg for censoring the Reynold photo but not doing the same for hate speech          The social networking site said in a statement that the photos were mistakenly removed and were being restored On Thursday and Friday, several Facebook users posted status updates venting about the site flagging the image and then removing it from their tribute posts.  \u0027Last night I posted a goodbye post to Burt Reynolds.

Don\u0027t assume someone is mean. It\u0027s easy to demonize people.\u0027Earlier this week, Mr Musk suggested in emails to a BuzzFeed journalist that er Vernon Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027.Musk also claimed, without providing any evidence, that Mr Unsworth had moved to northern Thailand to take \u0027a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u0027The Tesla CEO\u0027s attacks on  Mr Unsworth, whose efforts were considered crucial to the Thai operation, came after the British er criticized a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the cave rescue effort.Mr Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile. He then apologised for this, before repeating the claims this week.During the podcast, Musk was asked what percentage of his interactions with other people on Twitter was a good idea, with Rogan suggesting \u0027ten per cent\u0027.          Shocking: Musk called Vernon Unsworth a paedophile after the British er criticized the Tesla CEOs submarineMusk replied that \u0027it\u0027s on balance more good than bad, but there is definitely some bad\u0027. He later added: \u0027It\u0027s way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person.\u0027  Mr Unsworth, from St Albans in Hertfordshire has, through his lawyer, made it clear that he will be suing Musk over his comments.\u0027Elon Musk´s ongoing campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr. Unsworth is outrageous,\u0027 Unsworth\u0027s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, said in an email to Reuters.\u0027Musk has publicly and clearly stated that he `hopes´ to be sued. Let me be equally clear in response - Musk will be sued - not because of his hopes, but because he deserves to be sued,\u0027 Wood said. Musk\u0027s renewed attack on Mr Unsworth, his appearance on the show and his top accountant resigning on Friday saw Tesla\u0027s stock and bond prices drop even further today.During the podcast, Musk revealed that the one thing that keeps him up at night is his electrical car company.\u0027Its quite hard to run companies. Especially car companies. It\u0027s quite challenging. Space X is no walk in the park, but it\u0027s very difficult to keep a car company alive.\u0027There is only two car companies in the history of American car companies  that haven\u0027t gone bankrupt and that\u0027s Ford and Tesla. That\u0027s it. We barely survived.Rogan asked him how close Tesla had gotten to \u0027folding\u0027, to which Musk admitted it had been \u0027very close\u0027.  The $1.8 billion high-yield bond Tesla issued a year ago hit a record low price on Wednesday. It also became more expensive to insure Tesla\u0027s bonds against default.Tesla\u0027s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since August 7, when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding for a previously undisclosed plan to take Tesla private.Musk on  abandoned that plan on August 24, but he faces lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of his tweet that funding for the deal was \u0027secured.\u0027The incident is weighing on investor confidence and has hurt the credibility of Musk, long viewed by Tesla supporters as its most valuable asset.A lawsuit was filed on Thursday accusing  Musk of trying to \u0027burn\u0027 short-sellers through his false tweet  that funding had been secured to take Tesla private.\u0027This appears to be a textbook case of fraud,\u0027  Michael Canty of law firm Labaton Sucharow said in a press release.\u0027We believe Musk attempted to manipulate the price of Tesla securities with false and misleading tweets, in a directed effort to harm short-sellers.\u0027Labaton Sucharow is asking for class action status to represent anyone who bought or sold Tesla shares between August 7 and August 17. Musk has described the infamous privatization tweet - including his assurance that funding for going private was secured - as an attempt to be transparent. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/09/4FD22D6B00000578-6142257-image-a-18_1536308906232.jpg","title":"Britains biggest puppy Family adopts Great Dane 95lbs stands 6ft tall","story":"     Arnie the Great Dane is only five months old and already tips the scales at 43kg (95lbs) - and is still growing          The canine, who was adopted by Julie (right) and Colin Reid and their son Josh from Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire, is the biggest the team at Dogs Trust in Glasgow have ever cared for          After receiving a call from someone at Dogs Trust, the family went to see the canine and fell in love with himAfter falling in love with the dog, the family decided to adopt him - even though he dwarfs all of them when he stands  on his hind legs.Julie said: \u0027I received a call from someone at Dogs Trust saying Arnie had come in and that he was a Great Dane.Snake catcher teaches her adorable Jack Russell puppy named...Puppy love: lion, tiger and hyena cubs are reared by a...Share this article\u0027We didn\u0027t have a specific breed in mind when looking for a pet but Arnie is the perfect companion.\u0027When we went in to have a look at him and it was just love at first sight.\u0027He is gentle, loving and so playful he will definitely fit in at home, we are just relieved we have a big enough home to accommodate our new baby hippo.

But because of the prices, the returns and the ratio I\u0027ve come out on top and made money from them, which they don\u0027t like.          Mr Sharpe, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, claims he has had his accounts restricted with bet365.com, Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power\u0027Now if I want a selection on the horses and I go for a horse that\u0027s 5-1 and I try and offer bet365 a tenner, the answer is no - maximum stake 33p.\u0027There\u0027s no point in me gambling with them anymore because it\u0027s for pennies and they won\u0027t shut you down completely because they want to show their shareholders that they have this many million users.\u0027Obviously it\u0027s their right to trade with whom they wish but as soon as you start winning, that\u0027s it.\u0027Mr Sharpe opened his account with bet365 closed in June this year, just five months after he opened it. He opened a Paddy Power account online in September only for it to be closed in December. With bet365, he has only won £1,500 over the last year with the single biggest pay-out being a £400 win after he placed £10 on a 33-1 horse.Yet the highest stake he can now place with the bookie is 33p.He believes he is being punished because the company has noticed that he frequently backs the early price for a horse to win before the odds have shortened.By routinely backing horses at 20-1 before the odds shorten, to say 5-1, means that even though he loses more times than he wins, he still makes money in the long-run.          Mr Sharpe is one of a number of punters across the country who have their accounts restricted by bookmakers like Ladbrokes, Coral and others to stop players \u0027who know what they\u0027re doingEstimates suggest that 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted in similar ways. They include members of the House of Lords. The limiting of winning players is such a regular part of sports betting in Las Vegas that professional gamblers will intentionally place wagers at less-advantageous odds to stay off the radar.Operators say scrutinising winners is necessary to help prevent fraud - but critics argue that it is damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. It is now becoming increasingly prominent in the UK and is such a concern that the matter has been debated in Parliament.Mr Sharpe conducted a survey among 150 regular gamblers which found that more than half of them had had their accounts restricted by bet365, Paddy Power and Betfair          Mr Sharpe (pictured) had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racingAnother gambler, Will Tomassi, 39, from Farnham, Surrey, makes an average profit of between £3,500 a month on betting.He had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racing.Mr Tomassi, who works in sales for a medical company, said: \u0027I was going great guns but then they pulled the rug from under me which was extremely annoying.\u0027bet365 are really the only company who offer decent early prices on the dogs and I betted on \u0027match-ups\u0027 which was essentially picking one dog to beat another dog in the race.\u0027I started with a £2 beginning stake, which rose to £15 the more successful I became, but crucially I could roll over my winnings to a second or third race.\u0027So if I did get to a third bet, I could be betting as much as £60.\u0027Since the account was restricted, the most I can place on a bet in match-ups at any one time is £1 so it\u0027s more or less null and void.\u0027I can play a singles game and pick a winner but even then it\u0027s only for small change.\u0027The problem is that if you apply any kind of intelligence or any intent to try and work anything out, they cut you off straight away.\u0027Earlier this year All-Party Parliamentary Betting and Gaming Group held a seminar at the House of Lords to discuss account closures and restrictions by online bookmakers on successful punters.  Estimates suggest that around 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted to maximum bets of 33p - or closed as a result of winning too may bets The group\u0027s chairman Philip Davies MP told MailOnline that at least one member of the Lords had had their account restricted but declined to name who.The group is urging the gambling industry to introduce a minimum bet rule – already in place at racecourse bookies – which would require a betting company to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, typically £500.Mr Davies said: \u0027I accept that it\u0027s impossible for bookmakers to let punters lay anything they want on because they\u0027d probably go bust in no time.\u0027But there\u0027s a big difference in that and restricting someone to bet only a few pence or a few pounds.\u0027This happens to a lot of people, I know of a member of the House of Lords who has had his account restricted, and I\u0027m sure the industry will say it\u0027s a very small proportion of punters\u0027The whole point of gambling, whichever side of the counter you\u0027re on, is that sometimes you\u0027ll win and sometimes you\u0027ll lose.\u0027That\u0027 the nature of it and I think too many gambling companies have become risk averse and if you want to be risk averse you shouldn\u0027t be in the gambling industry.\u0027Bookmakers have been far too restrictive in the past but credit where credit\u0027s due, they are starting to wake up and are slowly but surely moving in the right direction.\u0027bet365 has yet to make comment however a spokesman for Ladbrokes and Coral, which merged in November 2016, admitted that a small number of their accounts were restricted.A spokesman said: \u0027Over a million people bet regularly with Ladbrokes and Coral in our betting shops, online and via mobile apps, and over 99 per cent of bets are laid as requested.\u0027Only a small minority of our customers experience restrictions on certain bets for risk management purposes, as is the case with all bookmakers.

I decided to put this into practice with patients referred to me by care homes, and I was astounded by the response of some of them.After only a few days of regular paracetamol, I was able stop all the anti-psychotic drugs prescribed for one lady. Paracetamol became my first-line treatment for agitation in elderly patients.But paracetamol isn’t the answer for everyone. Skilled nursing care is the missing factor in the tragic plight of so many dementia patients.Just because someone is unable to articulate how they are feeling or what is wrong, doesn’t mean they are not communicating.Non-verbal communication and subtle changes in demeanour can provide a wealth of information about the patient — but it takes experience and time spent with them to pick up on this.I was once called to see an elderly man with dementia in a nursing home. ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there’s a problem,’ his nurse said. He knelt down and gently took the man’s hand. ‘You can tell from his face. See . . .?’All I saw was an elderly man with his mouth wide open and expressionless eyes, utterly shut off from the world. Then his lip curled very slightly.‘There,’ the nurse said triumphantly. ‘He does that now and again when he’s hungry or thirsty, but he’s been doing it a lot for a few days now’.I wasn’t convinced, but realised the nurse knew his patient so well that he recognised minute, idiosyncratic changes in facial expression indicating a problem.However, after examining the patient I could find nothing wrong. The nurse continued to insist the opposite was true, so I arranged for the man to be admitted to hospital for a full investigation.He was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that had spread to his kidneys — and which must have been causing him acute pain. But thanks to his relationship with an empathetic nurse he didn’t have to sit there and suffer for long.Sadly, this type of patientnurse relationship is all too rare in the modern NHS and even in many care homes because of staff shortages, high turnover and a pressured environment.As a result society’s most vulnerable must suffer in silence.    DUMBING DOWN JUST WON\u0027T WORKThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has had a brainwave! Patients would be more engaged in their treatment if they were written to in language that avoided medical terminology — rather than copied in on a letter to their GP — after a specialist consultation.I tried it a few years ago but it wasn’t a success. It doubled my workload because I still had to record everything formally in the medical notes rather than rely on a letter to cover everything adequately. Nor did my patients like it. Quite rightly, they seemed to prefer medical professionals communicating with each other about their health, rather than via them in a dumbed-down letter that risked missing key details.Medical terminology and jargon is a language that’s evolved to communicate precise, complex things in as clear and unambiguous way as possible to others who speak that language.Most patients realise receiving a copy of such a letter is a courtesy, but it isn’t intended to explain things to them. That should be done face to face by the doctor during the appointment, and the patient encouraged to ask questions or seek clarification.To me, this interaction is the bedrock of good doctor-patient relationships. Firing off patronising missives to our patients is no substitute.   OLD AGE, NEW TAX!The crisis in social care is not going away. Latest figures from the charity Age UK show 1,000 elderly people are admitted to hospital every day simply due to a lack of adequate social care.I know too well how patients can languish on medical wards, waiting for the social care to be put in place so they can return to their own homes, or for a care home place to be found.It is grossly unfair on patients and puts them at risk of infections and a general deterioration in health: increasingly immobile and lacking the mental stimulation of a non- hospital environment.It is also a shameful waste of much-needed NHS beds. Calling the old and frail ‘bed blockers’ is distasteful, but through no fault of their own that’s what they are. The Government’s social care green paper this autumn will set out plans for addressing this escalating crisis. But the harsh truth is ministers have few options. The system desperately needs more cash and I’m afraid tax-payers must cough up.The alternative is a social care system not fit for purpose, that compromises the efficient functioning of the NHS, denies many the medical care they need and lets down the elderly.I dislike the idea of extra tax, but I dislike even more the idea of inadequate care when I’m old and infirm.A social care tax — ring-fenced so it isn’t subsumed by other expenditure — would let us start building the sort of 21st-century care system expected of the world’s sixth largest economy.If we don’t, then as former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said (albeit in a very different context): ‘I warn you not to grow old’   WHY DOES THE STIGMA OF HIV STILL LINGER?New cases of HIV are at their lowest level for nearly 20 years. This is in large part due to new therapies, including drugs that prevent someone who is HIV positive passing on the virus.It’s also thanks to PrEp (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a combination of two anti-HIV medicines that are taken daily and which protect someone who may be at high risk of exposure to HIV.It’s a truly seismic shift in the management of a disease that, when I started training to be a doctor in the late Nineties, was still considered a death sentence. Now, men and women infected with HIV and who have access to the best medication can expect to live as long as someone without the virus.Unfortunately, there has been no accompanying shift in public perception of the disease.We still make moral judgments about those who are HIV positive. We still regard infection as some sort of retribution for a debauched or hedonistic life.This contributes to the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and I believe it’s a factor in the significantly higher rates of mental health problems in HIV positive iniduals.For many newly-diagnosed, fear of being ostracised haunts them. So it’s no wonder rates of depression among the HIV positive are nearly ten times higher than in the general public.How sad that, despite incredible scientific advances that have enabled us to conquer HIV, we’ve reached the stage where it is society’s attitude rather than the virus itself that ensures HIV remains a feared diagnosis.  One in four student nurses quits before their course ends, according to new figures. Yet we face a shortfall of 40,000 nurses. It’s an absolute crisis. Nurses are frontline deliverers of care. Without enough, the NHS will collapse. This cannot continue. We can recruit more nurses from overseas — but we also need home-grown nurses, and there IS a simple solution. Abolish tuition fees for nursing degrees, and reinstate the student nurse grant. It would send a clear message that we value our nurses and are grateful for their vocation. If retention rates don’t improve, I fear we will live to regret it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/01/4FDBE4F200000578-0-image-a-18_1536365042407.jpg","title":"Facebook issues apology removing nude Cosmo photos Burt Reynolds tribute posts","story":"    Facebook issued an apology after the above photo from Burt Reynolds\u0027 Cosmo centerfold was removed from tribute posts           Facebook users complained that they were told the image violated community standards on nudity           Facebook automatically flagged the image and then removed it saying it was under review           One user called out Marc Zuckerberg for censoring the Reynold photo but not doing the same for hate speech          The social networking site said in a statement that the photos were mistakenly removed and were being restored On Thursday and Friday, several Facebook users posted status updates venting about the site flagging the image and then removing it from their tribute posts.  \u0027Last night I posted a goodbye post to Burt Reynolds.

Following Adolf Hitler\u0027s rise to power in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most prominently the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and people deemed \u0027undesirable\u0027. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other detention sites were established.The deportation of Jews to the ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \u0027Final Solution to the Jewish Question\u0027, discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces captured territories in the East, all anti-Jewish measures were radicalised.           Pictured are a few of the thousands of wedding rings the Nazis removed from their victims to salvage the gold, in a cave near the Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany. U.S. troops found rings, watches, precious stones, eyeglasses, and gold fillings extracted from inmates on 5 May 1945          Prisioner no. 40472 of the Auschwitz concentration-extermination camp, identified as Michaø Liborski. Other sources point Liborskiís number as 20909, and tell us he was born in Czernice on 14 September 1914, and died on 15 April 1942, thus being younger than 28 years old when these pictures were taken by Wilhelm Brasse. Brasse was ordered by SS staff to photograph the prisoners for their files, taking up to 50,000 identity pictures between 1940 and 1945          Executions of Jews by German army mobile killing units, the Einsatzgruppen, after they had dug their own graves, near Ivangorod, Ukraine, 1942. This photo was mailed from the Eastern Front to Germany and intercepted at a Warsaw post office by a member of the Polish resistance collecting documentation on Nazi war crimesUnder the coordination of the SS, with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party, killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout German-occupied Europe, and across all territories controlled by the Axis powers.Paramilitary units called Einsatzgruppen murdered around 1.3 million Jews in mass shootings between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942, victims were being deported from the ghettos in sealed freight trains to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, they were killed in gas chambers. The killing continued until the end of World War II in Europe in April-May 1945.\u0027These are a tiny sample of the brutality and death that the Nazi regime unleashed between 1939 and 1945,\u0027 added Joel.\u0027The images are hard, but they must be seen to understand what happened in those years so close to us.\u0027I tried to show each of the aspects of the Holocaust. Not very well-known aspects are represented, such as the mobile platoons, who were responsible for an immense percentage of the Shoah, the sub-camps, or the theft of rings extracted to the prisoners.\u0027Even so, many minorities are missing, such as the disabled, homosexuals, or Spanish Republican exiles.\u0027I have no personal or family relationship with the Holocaust, but I believe both the dead as the murderers were united by a same thing, that is, that we all are human beings and this helps me to understand that at any moment we can and we have passed from victims to executioners.\u0027The Holocaust and the Second World War have taught us many morals, but we have refused to listen to them, and now we keep wandering through the deserts of barbarism hitting us again and again.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/13/4FE0F4B700000578-6145357-Local_residents_find_shelter_at_a_school_gymnasium_in_Abira_Hokk-m-60_1536409681187.jpg","title":"Japan toll rises 30 powerful quake","story":"    Rescuers search for missing people at the site of a landslide triggered by Thursday\u0027s earthquake in Atsuma, Hokkaido, northern Japan.

Oxford Circus underground station was evacuated, producing a crush of people as they made for the exits. Reports circulated of shots being fired, and photos and video appeared online of crowds fleeing the area, with heavily armed police officers heading in the opposite direction. Amid the panic, it was unclear where exactly the threat was emanating from, or whether there might be a number of attacks going on simultaneously, as had occurred in Paris two years earlier. Armed police stormed Selfridges department store, while shoppers were instructed to evacuate the building. Inside the shop at the time was the pop star Olly Murs, who tweeted to nearly 8 million followers: “Fuck everyone get out of Selfridge now gun shots!!” As shoppers in the store made for the exits, others were rushing in at the same time, producing a stampede.Smartphones and social media meant that this whole event was recorded, shared and discussed in real time. The police attempted to quell the panic using their own Twitter feed, but this was more than offset by the sense of alarm that was engulfing other observers. Far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson tweeted that this “looks like another jihad attack in London”. The Daily Mail unearthed an innocent tweet from 10 days earlier, which had described a “lorry stopped on a pavement in Oxford Street”, and used this as a basis on which to tweet “Gunshots fired” as armed police officers surrounded Oxford Circus station after “lorry ploughs into pedestrians”. The media were not so much reporting facts, as serving to synchronise attention and emotion across a watching public.Around an hour after the initial evacuation of Oxford Circus, the police put out a statement that “to date police have not located any trace of any suspects, evidence of shots fired or casualties”. It subsequently emerged that nine people required treatment in hospital for injuries sustained in the panic, but nothing more serious had yet been discovered. A few minutes later, the London Underground authority tweeted that stations had reopened and trains were running normally. There were no guns and no terrorists.What had caused this event? The police had received numerous calls from members of the public reporting gunshots on the underground and at street level, and had arrived within six minutes ready to respond. But the only violence that anyone had witnessed with their eyes was a scuffle on an overcrowded rush-hour platform, as two men bumped into each other, and a punch or two was thrown. While it remained unclear what had caused the impression of shots being fired, the scuffle had been enough to lead the surrounding crowd to retreat suddenly in fear, producing a wave of rapid movement that was then amplified as it spread along the busy platform and through the station. Given that there had been terrorist attacks in London earlier in the year and others reportedly foiled by the police, it is not hard to understand how panic might have spread in such confined spaces. Nobody would expect people to act in accordance with the facts in the heat of the moment, as a mass of bodies are hurtling and screaming around them. Where rapid response is essential, bodily instinct takes hold.Following the Oxford Circus incident, local shopkeepers demanded the installation of a “Tokyo-style” loudspeaker system in the surrounding streets to allow the police to communicate with entire crowds all at once. The idea gained little traction but did partly diagnose the problem. Where events are unfolding rapidly and emotions are riding high, there is a sudden absence of any authoritative perspective on reality. In the digital age, that vacuum of hard knowledge becomes rapidly filled by rumours, fantasy and guesswork, some of which is quickly twisted and exaggerated to suit a preferred narrative. Fear of violence can be just as disruptive a force as actual violence, and it can be difficult to quell once it is at large.Given sufficient speed, virality can generate fear and conflict out of thin air. Research recently published by Warwick University showed a correlation between anti-refugee hate crimes in Germany and levels of Facebook use, indicating the danger and paranoia that rapid peer-to-peer information transmission can manufacture. Facebook has also been implicated in ethnic violence in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India, due to online rumours triggering physical mobilisations and confrontations.Events such as these distil something about the times in which we live, when speed of reaction often takes precedence over slower and more cautious assessments. As we become more attuned to “real time” media, we inevitably end up placing more trust in sensation and emotion than in evidence. Knowledge becomes more valued for its speed and impact than for its cold objectivity, and – as studies of Twitter content have confirmed – emotive falsehood often travels faster than fact. In situations of physical danger, where time is of the essence, rapid reaction makes sense. But the influence of “real time” data now extends well beyond matters of security. News, financial markets, friendships and work engage us in a constant flow of information, making it harder to stand back and construct a more reliable or consensual portrait of any of them. The threat lurking in this is that otherwise peaceful situations can come to feel dangerous, until eventually they really are.In the context of rising populism, and the accompanying syndromes denounced as “post-truth” and “tribalism”, it is common to blame political turbulence on voters giving vent to their feelings. But telling people to keep their emotions in check, and bow down before their more rational superiors, is scarcely an appealing or effective message. To criticise populists and their supporters in these terms is to avoid confronting the much larger question of why feeling might have become a more important navigational aid in the 21st century. Rather than criticise people for a lack of self-control, how might we understand the historical transition that has turned feeling into such a potent political force?This question returns us to some foundational philosophical issues. The modern world was founded on two fundamental distinctions, both inaugurated in the mid-17th century: between mind and body, and between war and peace. These binaries have been gradually weakening for more than 100 years. The rise of psychology and psychiatry in the late 19th century brought mind and body into closer proximity to each other, demonstrating how our thoughts are influenced by nervous impulses and feelings. The invention of aerial bombing in the early 20th century meant that war came to include techniques for terrifying and policing civilian populations.These two distinctions – between mind and body, and war and peace – now appear to have lost credibility altogether, with the result that we experience conflict intruding into everyday life with increasing regularity. Since the 1990s, rapid advances in neuroscience have elevated the brain over the mind as the main way by which we understand ourselves, demonstrating the importance of emotion and physiology to all decision making. Meanwhile, new forms of violence have emerged, in which states are attacked by non-state groups (such as Islamic State), interstate conflicts are fought using nonmilitary means (such as cyberwarfare), and the distinction between policing and military intervention becomes blurred. Our condition is one of nervous states, with iniduals and governments existing in a state of constant and heightened alertness, relying increasingly on feeling rather than fact.When we speak of feeling something, this can mean two different things. First, there is physical sensation, including pleasure and pain, which is crucial for navigating our environment. Our nervous system receives sensations from the outside world that are used to coordinate our bodies and instinctive movements. The brilliance of our neurological network is that it facilitates immediate response to new information, whether that be from our physical circumstances or our internal organs. The brain manages sensory impressions extremely rapidly, offering among other things a crucial defence against external threats. Inidual sensations may not count as knowledge or facts, but they are an indispensable form of data, which we rely on almost constantly.Second, there are feelings in the sense of emotions. These are experiences that we are capable of consciously reflecting on and articulating. We have a wide vocabulary for naming and expressing these feelings. We communicate them physically in our facial expressions and body language. They tell us important things about our relationships, lifestyles, desires and identities. Feelings of this sort present themselves to our conscious selves, such that we actually notice them, even if we can’t control them. Emotions can now be captured and algorithmically analysed (“sentiment analysis”) thanks to the behavioural data that digital technologies collect. And yet feelings of this sort are not welcome everywhere. In many contexts, an accusation of being “emotional” carries the implication that someone has lost objectivity and given way to irrational forces.Feelings are how we orient ourselves, while also providing a reminder of shared humanity. Our capacity to feel pain, empathy and love is fundamental to how and why we care about each other. But as examples such as the Oxford Circus panic demonstrate, survival instincts and nerves are not always reliable. The information feelings convey in the moment can conflict starkly with the facts that are subsequently established. The crucial quality of feelings – their immediacy – is also what makes them potentially misleading, spawning overreactions and fear. Unscrupulous politicians and businesses have long exploited our instincts and emotions to convince us to believe or buy things that, on more careful reflection, we needn’t have done. Real-time media, available via mobile technologies, exacerbate this potential, meaning that we spend more of our time immersed in a stream of images and sensations, with less time for reflection or dispassionate analysis. If politics and public debate have become more emotional, as so many observers have claimed, this is as much a reflection on the speed and relentlessness of current media technologies as anything else.During the 17th century, a number of European scholars produced ideas and institutions that aimed to regulate feelings, on the basis that they were untrustworthy and possibly dangerous. The French philosopher René Descartes treated physical sensations with great suspicion, in contrast to rational principles belonging to the mind. The English political theorist Thomas Hobbes argued that the central purpose of the state was to eradicate feelings of mutual fear and suspicion that could otherwise trigger violence. In the same era, pioneering communities of merchants and scientists introduced strict new rules for how their impressions should be recorded and spoken of, to avoid exaggeration and distortion, using numbers and public record-keeping. They would later become known as experts, and their ability to keep personal feelings separate from their observations was one of their distinguishing traits.This era produced the intellectual building blocks of the modern age. Contemporary notions of truth, scientific expertise, public administration, experimental evidence and progress are all legacies of the 17th century. The elevation of reason above feeling was hugely productive, indeed world-changing in its implications. And yet it wasn’t simply knowledge that was being sought it was also peace. To this day, much of the value of objectivity in public life, as manifest in statistics or news reports, is that it provides a basis for agreement among people who otherwise have little in common. A society that recognises the authority of facts must also establish certain professions and institutions that are beyond the fray of politics, sentiment or opinion.That 17th-century project has run aground, with the results we see around us today. Those very same professions on which the modern technocratic edifice was first built are now lumped together as a “liberal elite”. Experts and facts no longer seem capable of settling arguments to the extent that they once did, while trust in the media in particular is in free fall. Objective claims about the economy, society, the human body and even nature can no longer be so successfully insulated from emotions and identities, whether on the left or the right. Consequently, the governmental institutions of the EU and Washington, DC are widely viewed as centres of elite privilege, which serve themselves rather than the public.Events such as the “March for Science” which took place in March 2017 to defend science against political attacks showcase experts engaged in their own form of political mobilisation, appealing to public sentiment like any other movement. When technocrats do attempt to remain dispassionate, they run the risk of looking smug or aloof. This indicates that the politics of feeling is now unavoidable, whether one likes that or not.Some feelings have greater political potency than others. Feelings of nostalgia, resentment, anger and fear have disrupted the status quo. Populist uprisings, as manifest in the victories of Donald Trump, the Brexit campaign and nationalist surges across Europe, are cases of this, and have been widely criticised for their denigration of expertise and harnessing of emotional discontents. But these are symptoms of a problem and not a cause. Inidual leaders and campaigns will come and go, but the conditions that enabled them will endure. Rather than simply hurl more facts at these disturbances, we would do better to understand their underlying drivers. It’s no good simply declaring that experts are in possession of truth, and must therefore be obeyed. We need to understand why the ideal of expertise has lost credibility.The aspiration to “objectivity” is in particular trouble in the economic realm. But there are good reasons why this is so. Objective indicators of progress, such as GDP growth, conceal deep fractures within society. In the US, for example, half of the population has experienced no real income growth since the 1970s, making the very notion of economic “growth” a lie. Unemployment is falling across much of Europe and the US at the moment, but this much-celebrated fact conceals the rising number of people who are being eliminated (or absenting themselves) from the labour market for reasons of ill-health, exhaustion and addiction, or taking jobs that are far inferior to ones they held in the past.The resentment that has been directed against “liberal elites” living in major cities is not simply irrational but reflects some basic realities about how people experience inequality as a moral force, indeed a judgment. The economy isn’t just a domain for the satisfaction of objective needs and demands (as economists see it) but also one where we acquire status and self-respect. This is true the whole way across the income spectrum. Feelings of resentment or anger are not the preserve of some mythical white working class.Yet certain demographics clearly experience far greater cultural and emotional distance from “liberal elites” than others. As party politics becomes more professionalised, it becomes harder to see any marked difference between elected representatives and their expert advisers the state looks to many like a game being played by insiders.Feelings of disenfranchisement are not merely economic, but have acquired a bodily and existential dimension: people’s lives are being shaped by ergent health, life expectancy and encounters with physical and psychological pain. Pessimism emanates most strongly from bodies that are ageing faster and suffering more – further evidence that we cannot tidily separate how things appear to our minds from how they feel to our bodies.One could leave the story there, and simply lament the decline of modern reason, as if emotions have overwhelmed the citadel of truth like barbarians. The most vehement defenders of scientific rationality claim that alien forces – liars, demagogues, Kremlin trolls, “postmodernists” or the uneducated public – have been granted too much power, and need to be eliminated from politics all over again.In addition to its naivety regarding the roots of populism, this response ignores a second pivotal historical development that is no less important for shaping the modern world. The desire to harness emotions and physical instincts for political purposes also has a long history, producing its own centres of elite control, but with one crucial difference: it operates in the service of conflict rather than of peace. At the height of the Enlightenment, as reason appeared to be triumphing once and for all, the French Revolution demonstrated the immense military power that could be unleashed by popular sentiment.Modern warfare creates miasmas of emotion, information, misinformation, deception and secrecy. It mobilises infrastructure, civilian populations, industry and intelligence services in innovative ways. The rise of aerial warfare meant that problems of civilian morale and real-time decision making acquired greater urgency, producing new techniques for gauging and managing popular sentiment and sensing incoming threats. It was this paranoia that led to the invention of the digital computer and later the internet. During wartime, information becomes valued for its speed and impact as much as its public credibility. One of the principle justifications that the George W Bush administration gave for water-boarding was that information needed to be extracted from prisoners quickly, before it was too late. This is a whole new way of handling the question of truth, which often runs entirely counter to the original scientific ideal of reason and expertise.Recently this spirit of warfare has been fed into civilian life as the emphasis on “real time” knowledge has become a feature of the business world, of the financial sector and the big Silicon Valley companies. The speed of knowledge and decision making becomes crucial, and public agreement is sidelined in the process. Rather than trusting experts, on the basis that they are neutral and outside the fray, we have come to rely on services that are fast, but whose public status is unclear.The ideology of entrepreneurship is a contributory factor here. Since the 1970s, organisations have been exhorted to become more “agile” in the face of change, while business “disruptors” focus on seeking to exploit new knowledge and ideas before their rivals. Speed is of the essence. Among traders, whose skill lies in exploiting minuscule price movements, sometimes just fractions of a second before others. Marketing analysts aim at detecting trends as early as possible. These are exercises in feeling and sensing, rather than of reasoning. And yet nobody ever accused an advertising agency of being “post-truth”.The promise of expertise, first made in the 17th century, is to provide us with a version of reality that we can all agree on. The promise of digital computingis to maximise sensitivity to a changing environment. Timing becomes everything. Experts produce facts Google and Twitter offer trends. As the objective view of the world recedes, it is replaced by intuition as to which way things are heading now. This nervous state offers more emotional stimulation and sensitivity, but for the same reason it is unsettling and disruptive of peaceful situations. Meanwhile the question of who might be seeking to trigger specific feelings and why lurks in the background.The ultimate danger of this condition is the one identified by Hobbes in the 17th century. Telling people that they are secure is of limited value if they sense that they are in situations of danger. The spread of post-traumatic stress disorder (a syndrome first associated with war) is one example of how symptoms of combat are becoming features of civilian life. Symptoms arise due to threats that are constant and overpowering, which can just as easily mean school bullying or controlling relationships. Wherever one stands on debates surrounding “free speech”, “trigger warnings” or “safe spaces”, it is unarguable that the boundary between “civil” and “violent” conduct has become much harder to draw – an effect of neuroscientific progress as much as of identity politics. The sudden appearance of “weaponisation” as a concept (for instance that Facebook has been “weaponised” by political campaigns) shows that once-peaceful relations are being reconceived as violent. And as the metaphor of “war” spreads (as in the “war on drugs”, “culture war” or “information war”), so trust in the institutions that make up civil society deteriorates. For those intent on sabotage, this is entirely the point.When reason itself is in peril, there is an understandable instinct to try to revive or rescue something from the past. It has become a cliche to celebrate the rugged inidualism, cold rationality and truth-seeking courage of the scientific pioneers. But in our current age, when intelligence and calculation are performed faster and more accurately by machines than by people, an alternative ideal is needed. Perhaps the great virtue of the scientific method is not that it is smart (which is now an attribute of phones, cities and fridges) but that it is slow and careful. Maybe it is not more intelligence that we need right now, but less speed and more care, both in our thinking and our feeling. After all, emotions (including anger) can be eminently reasonable, if they are granted the time to be articulated and heard. Conversely, advanced intelligence can be entirely unreasonable, when it moves at such speed as to defy any possibility of dialogue.Democracies are being transformed by the power of feeling in ways that cannot be ignored or reversed. Separating rationality from emotion is no longer possible. This is our reality now. We can’t reverse history, and nor can we circumvent it this new era needs to be traversed with unusual judgment and care. Rather than denigrate the influence of feelings in politics today, we might need to get better at listening to and learning from them •• Nervous Statesis published by Cape on 20 September.

I lived there until I left for university at 18. Those were my formative years, both in a sense of day-to-day experience, and in an overarching existential sense of being raised determinedly middle class surrounded by an infrastructure and a culture created entirely by the skilled working class.Birmingham was amazingly prosperous in those early years. Factories were humming, and workers were well paid. I remember my grandma visiting from Yorkshire for Christmas in the early 1960s and helping my mother with some last-minute shopping. She came home trembling with excitement. For the first time in her life she had seen an ordinary person holding a five-pound note.I remember huge workforces would pour out of factories at the end of their shifts – men on foot or on bicycles, heading home. I remember glossy firms making complex components out of unpronounceable alloys. I remember tiny two- or three-man workshops with lathes and drill presses set on lumpy earth floors. A friend’s dad worked in one. We would visit him every other Saturday lunchtime. If he had to work overtime, I would get his season ticket to the football. One Saturday we found him stamping out fake ancient Greek coins. They had been ordered by the tourist board in Crete, to bury in the sand around Knossos, for visitors to find.The feeling was that anything could be made, on time and on budget, with no fuss or drama. That was the Birmingham way. I absorbed the lesson, probably to my detriment. I am permanently overcommitted, because if I say “no” to something, I see a phantom Brummie from 60 years ago, sneering at me, thinking: “Bloody prima donna.”There were other downsides. Pollution was insane. Rivers would catch fire. We had a patch of mud with two sickly trees, which with yearning irony we called Bluebell Woods. Except the mud was bubbling oil waste. If it got on your clothes they were ruined, and if it got on your skin you had to run home and clean it off with lighter fluid. I remember pea soup fogs. I was a kid, and therefore short, but I couldn’t see my feet. We put wet towels against windows and doors, but after three days the fog was as thick inside as outside.I learned artistic lessons, too. Birmingham was a car town above all else, and the first Ford Cortina – made in Dagenham – prompted a lot of comment. The story was the steering wheel had been redesigned over and over to save a penny in manufacture. Every Brummie knew why – a million steering wheels is a million pennies, which were worth saving – but some non-Brummies regretted that art was compromised by commerce. I felt they could be the same thing. I still do. If I write a book, but no one reads it, have I actually written a book at all?The biggest gift of those 14 formative years was reading. At first there was nothing else to do. I haunted the library. We ran a Chicago system for getting extra library tickets. Every visitor to our house was signed up. Even our dog had a library ticket. I read constantly. Later there were other things to do – in Birmingham the 60s finally kicked in about 1969 – but I kept on reading. When I started writing I had tens of thousands of books in my head – plus the Brummie attitude: no fuss, no drama, just get it done, and well, with a little quiet pride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/771267cbf259eec10bfa2f138a4694f5dfb16ae1/175_364_3276_1967/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d866876936c28cbbe20e97f464fcc867","title":"ryanair crew consider biggest strikes in companys history","story":"Unions representing cabin staff threaten to extend summer of industrial action into the autumnRyanair cabin crew have said they are considering the biggest strikes in the airline’s history unless it agrees to improved working conditions.The Dublin-based airline suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, as action by pilots and cabin crew forced it to cancel flights, including to major holiday destinations such as Italy, Portugal and Spain.It secured a breakthrough in August after reaching a deal with striking Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could secure deals in other markets. But on Friday unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands threatened in a joint letter to extend the summer of industrial action into the autumn.Unions locked in a long-running battle with the airline said they would hold “the biggest strike action the company has ever seen” unless changes were made to their conditions. After a meeting in Rome, unions demanded that staff were given local contracts under local law rather than Irish contracts, which Ryanair uses across its European workforce.They said the strike would take place in the last week of September and that a decision on whether to go ahead would be made by 13 September.“We want to solve this. We don’t want to strike,” said Fernando Gandra, director at Portuguese union SNPVAC. He said the two Italian unions also had pilot members and that the unions would invite pilots and ground staff across Europe to join their cabin crew colleagues in the strike.“The board and management of Ryanair are committed to union recognition, and working constructively with our people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter Ryanair’s low-cost model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers,” Ryanair’s chief people officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement on the Dublin fleet plans.The airline said it had informed 300 pilots and cabin crew in Dublin that their jobs were now safe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68cb0f97ca513dd02a2699ac20a9b8698b04523/0_203_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7332d5b095f4b5f52fbcfc63d4f37dc","title":"alibaba co founder jack ma to retire say reports","story":"Ma, who has a net worth of $36.6bn, says retirement is the beginning of an era as he focuses on philanthropyAlibaba’s co-founder and executive chairman Jack Ma will reportedly retire from the e-commerce company on Monday, as the former English teacher seeks to focus on philanthropy in education.Ma, one of China’s best known corporate leaders, will remain on the company’s board of directors and continue to mentor its management, the New York Times said on Friday.Ma, who founded Alibaba in 1999, stepped down as chief executive in 2013. He currently serves as the company’s international face at top political and business events.Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment, but said in a social media posting on Saturday that Ma had met visiting African leaders and business partners in recent days.Ma, China’s third richest person with a net worth of $36.6b according to Forbes magazine, was quoted as saying his retirement was not the end of an era, but the beginning of one.While Ma‘s retirement from a formal role is a milestone, analysts and industry professionals say it is unlikely his involvement will change significantly. “I don’t think it means that much, frankly. He stepped back from the CEO role about four or five years ago and very specifically made a comment about wanting the younger people to lead the company,” said Kevin Carter, founder of The Emerging Markets Internet exchange-trade fund.Ma, who turns 54 on Monday, oversees a number of charitable projects in education and environmental fields. He is a cult figure in China’s internet industry and has attracted a big following among entrepreneurs and in pop culture.At events, he is often met with screaming fans. Ma maintains a prominent international profile, frequently inviting global leaders to the company’s Hangzhou headquarters. Last year, he met Donald Trump, who described him as “smart” and “open minded”. Alibaba was founded by 18 people led by Ma. China’s biggest e-commerce firm, it now has more than 66,000 full-time employees, according to the company’s latest annual filing.The company had a market value of about $420bn. Ma also controls Ant Financial, which was valued at about $150b after a recent fundraising round.Ma is stepping back at a tricky time for Chinese tech firms.Authorities have increasingly sought to regulate the industry where Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd are fighting a fierce battle for consumers.Trade tensions also present a new challenge for Chinese tech firms, especially those such as Alibaba which are expanding overseas rapidly.This year, regulators shot down a $1.2bn bid for money transfer service Moneygram International Inc by Ant Financial on national security grounds, which the company said was related to “geopolitical” changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deaf09a3b270f36206f0c50fcbebeebbed86c78b/269_426_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b24c7c2f0e7663f152bee16a2a6c76e","title":"karen bradley northern ireland secretary tories","story":"The Northern Ireland secretary’s ignorance of the most sensitive region of the UK takes the cabinet beyond shamePay attention, entrails-pickers: this dead government has yielded up a new sign. She is Karen Bradley, actual secretary of state for actual Northern Ireland, and she has granted an interview to Parliament’s The House magazine. “I freely admit,” Karen freely admitted, “that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland. I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland – people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa.”For me, I think that quote may be the equivalent of the death blow in Kill Bill. Do you know the one? You get hit just with fingertips, “and then he lets you walk away. But once you’ve taken five steps, your heart explodes in your body, and you fall to the floor, dead.” So with the Northern Ireland secretary’s hot take on Northern Ireland. My mechanism might be shot for good after reading it. I may well be typing my last five steps here.Clearly, it is not simply the initial imbecility of having no clue about the central facts of Northern Irish politics and history, even though you were 28 (TWENTY EIGHT) when the Good Friday agreement was signed. It is also the second imbecility of thinking you should ever mention that in public, much less as delightedly, as Karen did. “It’s when you realise that,” burbled the secretary of state, “that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”I mean ... ideally, you would start understanding these things some decades before you were the cabinet minister with operational responsibility for arguably the most highly sensitive region of the United Kingdom. Instead, Karen’s breezy “My Learning Curve” speech casts high office as a remedial scheme for the unreachable outliers of Family Fortunes survey respondents. “We asked 100 people what they imagined were the Ladybird-level facts about Northern Ireland …”Karen’s answer is the type of WTF-ery that allows even Vernon Kay (VERNON KAY) to mug to camera with the practised eyebrow-raise that says: where do they find these quarterwits? It was previously thought that any challenge to Andrea Leadsom’s position as stupidest cabinet minister would have to hail from the mineral or at least vegetable kingdoms. Or be Chris Grayling. But this is quite sensational from Karen, who places herself in the IDS class at a stroke. Theresa May’s decision to appoint her to this government of all the talentless underscores exactly where we are. If you hadn’t already swallowed the red pill, you may safely consider Karen’s interview as your dose. No going back now. The answer to the question “How low is the bar?” is: the bar is in another hemisphere. The bar is orbiting Jupiter. There is no bar.Any bright spots? Well, I see Arron Banks has once again had his bid to sign for the Conservatives knocked back. At this rate, he’s going to notch up more failed medicals than John Hartson.But darker portents attend Karen’s predecessor as the cabinet minister most wantonly and insouciantly unsuited to their job. It’s been a mixed week for Boris Johnson. On the downside for us, Boris has been explicitly backed for the leadership by cruelly miscast kingmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg. On the upside, Johnson’s statement announcing his orce from his wife tees up a series of malarial Love Actually plotlines for when he later – or sooner – gets the keys to No 10. (And if you’re still doubting the heart-exploding inevitability of that scenario, you must have been watching the global upsets of the past two years on tape delay. Everything that can go wrong does. Buy shares in distilleries today.)As for the coveted endorsement from someone Boris would unquestionably have pitied mercilessly at school (they missed being Eton contemporaries by a year), it came in an LBC interview. “Two years ago, in the Conservative party leadership campaign, I supported Boris Johnson, because I thought he would deliver Brexit extraordinarily well,” Rees-Mogg intoned, suggesting he has inherited all his father’s gifts of prophecy. “I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to change my mind on that.” Not anything?! Should have gone to MonocleSavers.Yet Boris is undeniably back. He has never been more back. Perhaps the most striking feature of the immediate period is how people decisively written off as wrong-’uns in the very recent past are emerging again as comparatively attractive prospects. Two years ago, Michael Gove had been deservedly downgraded to a mere Brutus emoji now he’s apparently a leadership contender once more. Outside Westminster, what a pleasure to see Mervyn King given so much airtime this week to sniff about Brexit “chaos”. Is this the same Mervyn King who, as governor of the Bank of England, presided over the first run on a British bank since the 1860s?Perhaps the preposterous inadequates of the past do all seem like elder statespeople now. Others appear so inspired by their accelerated rehabilitation that they are trying to pull off something similar instantly. Take David Davis, who announced this week that he would attend a Leave Means Leave rally in Bolton “as a matter of principle, to ensure Brexit is delivered”.What can you say? Until about 10 minutes ago, David had spent two years as the cabinet minister literally in charge of delivering it. This is like setting fire to a building, running away, then standing outside telling the emergency services how you’d be handling the rescue differently.Expect plenty more auditions for the role of Captain Hindsight in the weeks and months ahead. First the government and its renegades were post-truth now they are post-shame. And that about wraps up this week’s roundup. Try not to choke on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876d0c15df68a6e76d1d34b988634eecc127267d/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c082af3f52d3d3a354392fcf6a11969","title":"scientists get ready to begin great pacific garbage patch cleanup","story":"Ambitious project will involve a massive floating barrier that aims to collect up to five tonnes of plastics every month A team of scientists and engineers will on Saturday begin an ambitious cleanup of plastics in the Pacific Ocean targeting a stretch of water three times the size of France known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.A 600m-long floating barrier will be launched off the coast of San Francisco and, powered by currents, waves and wind, will aim to collect five tonnes of plastic debris each month.The marine apparatus known as System 001 is the brainchild of the Dutch inventor Boyan Slat who founded The Ocean Cleanup at the age of 18 in 2013.Along with 70 staff he has spent the last five years testing 273 models and six different prototypes as part of the $20m (£15.5m) Netherlands-based project before arriving at the current design – nicknamed “Wilson” in reference to the famous volleyball from the film Castaway.The structure comprises 60 adjoining units forming a giant C-shaped tube attached to a three-metre deep impenetrable skirt which will collect plastic waste of 1cm diameter and larger, as well as discarded fishing nets, as it skims the ocean’s surface.The cleanup system will be towed out past Alcatraz and beneath the Golden Gate Bridge into the Pacific Ocean where it will undergo two weeks of operational testing at around 250 nautical miles (463km) offshore before starting its mission. The system will be equipped with location-broadcasting technology in order to stop vessels from running into it.The team expects to remove the accumulated debris every six weeks using a support vessel before transferring the plastic waste to the Netherlands to be recycled.A recent study found 1.8tn pieces of plastic weighing 80,000 metric tonnes are currently afloat in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – a stretch of ocean running between California and Hawaii covering 1.6m sq km.Rick Stafford, professor of marine biology and conservation at Bournemouth University, said: “It could remove a lot of large plastics from the ocean, which is positive as long as it will not harm sea life.”The barrier was designed not to entangle fish and sea mammals which can swim under the skirt but Stafford said there would undoubtedly be a degree of bycatch.“Fish such as tuna could get caught up in the debris. Or if turtles get pushed up into the skirt there is a chance they will end up eating the plastic.”He also raised concerns about how the device might be cleaned and the possible use of toxic anti-fouling coatings that could leach into the sea.But he added: “My biggest concern is that providing a potential technological solution could make us feel like we have dealt with the plastics problem – whereas in reality we need strong policy and legislation to ban disposable plastics.”Sue Kinsey, pollution policy officer at the Marine Conservation Society, agreed.“While we understand the desire and passion behind this project, we feel more time and energy must be invested to stop litter entering our oceans in the first place.“Additionally we have serious concerns that wildlife will be affected, especially the smaller floating plankton that many creatures depend on for food and those organisms that float passively.She added: “Litter is distributed throughout the water column and this device will only pick up the first few metres of material and miss much of the microscopic waste that is impossible to collect and recycle.”The Ocean Cleanup published an independent environmental impact assessment in July to address such concerns.Chief operating officer, Lonneke Holierhoek said: “Plankton and different types of marine life are already affected by the floating debris out there. We will work with the knowledge we gain to minimise any impact.”She added: “We feel a sense of urgency to start cleaning up and to learn how our ideas will work in reality. But this is by no means the end of the process. We believe we can scale up pretty quickly and have a full fleet of systems in the north Pacific by 2021.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c32323a555eb4ace170552f8e35c0eef9f09852/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=724508d98492094b80794db7c2d3e471 1760w","title":"best skin serums any age skin type sali hughes","story":"Hyaluronic acid and vitamin C can benefit everyone, whatever your skin concernIf you buy only one serum your whole life (and I use the word as the common cosmetics term for thin, viscous skincare treatments, never in the altogether different biological sense), make it a combination of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C.

So why are we still stuck with polite social realism and sniggery classism?Billy Liar always was a great night out. “A brand new kind of escapist entertainment,” the trailer blared when the film was released in 1963. But the escape it most literally concerned – one in which a northern funeral clerk might jump on a train and make it as a London scriptwriter – wasn’t then so far fetched. Adapted from his own novel by Keith Waterhouse, it arrived in a Britain giddy on the Beatles and grammar school upstarts like Billy. Social mobility brought the film to life. While director John Schlesinger was solidly Hampstead, Waterhouse was a dropout from Osmondthorpe Council School, Leeds, and star Tom Courtenay the son of a Hull dockworker. As the box office boomed, a daydreamer might have conjured up a British film industry filled with working-class actors and writers, maybe even directors and producers, too.Of course – spoiler warning – Billy never caught the train. The apparent golden age of social mobility would quickly sputter out. And the idea of this class calling the shots in British cinema? Rarely more than fantasy. Now, the mood is darker. In 2018, it can be hard finding working-class talent exerting any influence in the creative space of British film.Even the actors are vanishing. “We have got a big problem,” Equity president Maureen Beattie said recently of the lack of opportunities for working-class performers. Actors including Maxine Peake and Lesley Manville appeared at the BFI this spring to publicly highlight the crisis. Drama has been cut from the classroom, young actors priced out of training, a glum contest among those who remain for dwindling roles as gang members and sex workers.But actors are just part of an ecosystem. They can only play roles created by writers for films made by directors. And the story of working- class screenwriters is another with a glorious future behind it – the postwar era that produced Waterhouse also witnessed the black precision of Harold Pinter and the singular vision of Shelagh Delaney, writer of A Taste of Honey, finder of wonder in back streets and bedsits. It’s worth pausing just to consider how unlikely it would now be for a major British film to be written by a young woman from Salford with no university education.Feel free to start counting. Of course, British directors from working-class backgrounds make high‑profile films. Just not many – and these success stories tend to come with caveats. Danny Boyle made his first feature, Shallow Grave, nearly 25 years ago. Steve McQueen will open the London film festival in October with his much-anticipated thriller Widows, but his route from the London suburb of Hanwell to the red carpet came via the art world, which, like theatre, is more meritocratic than British film. And then there is Lynne Ramsay. For a director in a landscape of limited chances, the reward can be whispering campaigns. Ramsay, whose mother was a cleaner in Glasgow, acquired a reputation as difficult and volatile and all the other codewords used for working-class women who have an opinion. Her last film, the astonishing crime drama You Were Never Really Here, was wildly praised. It was also only her fourth feature film in nearly two decades.Move through the ranks of the business – past the actors, writers and directors – and eventually you reach the producers, development executives, the heads of production companies and funding bodies. Here at last are the decision-makers who shape everything British you see on a cinema screen. Socio-economically, it is a group drawn from the same pool as so many of our MPs, lawyers and journalists.It was ever thus and the 1960s didn’t change it. Legally, class is not a “protected characteristic” in the labour market – but then film is mostly lawless anyway, filled with opaque hiring practices and internships for those whose bills are paid by other means. From script readers up, the result has been a highly specialised gatekeeper class taking charge of endless safety-first development streams. Presented with working-class experiences, its members might just as well be listening to Finnish. The issue is not only people having a fair shot at the top jobs in British film also at stake are the films that never get made.A defining feature of the 60s working-class moment was youth – Delaney co-wrote the screenplay for A Taste of Honey at 22. The tradition endured: Ramsay was 29 when she made her first feature Ratcatcher, Shane Meadows 23 at the time of his, Small Time. Now, the industry’s risk aversion would slow any young film-maker – but the particular discomfort with these kinds of voices means an extra long spell in limbo. Director Deborah Haywood was 47 before she made her debut feature, this summer’s brilliantly off-kilter portrait of smalltown England, Pin Cushion. Colin O’Toole, winner of the 2018 Bafta for best British short with the tightly wound Cowboy Dave, is already 40 with a string of other shorts behind him. Meadows, by the way, effectively left British film in favour of TV 10 years ago.While it felt reasonable to hope that iPhones and YouTube – or at least cheap cameras and Vimeo – would provide cinema with a new generation of ordinary hotshots, the reality has been patchy. Gifted young directors have appeared online, many either working class or dealing with working-class life – Cecile Emeke, Aaron Dunleavy, Kibwe Tavares, Emma Gilbertson. But a well‑signposted bridge has yet to open between online creativity (nimble, democratic) and British cinema (nervous, arthritic).In 2018, class definitions are works in progress, old touchstones such as university degrees less meaningful, race and gender recognised as central. But to get lower-class characters on to a big screen, the safest bet remains being Ken Loach. Thank God for him – few directors have his heft, or could have made a film as vital as I, Daniel Blake. Things only get tricky when the industry sees Loach as a ticked box, apparently believing working-class people exist in a state of gritty social realism the way children think Victorians lived in black and white.Loach has always been more subtle than that. But what are missing are emotionally complex films about people who just happen to work in call centres – one exception that proves the rule is Debbie Tucker Green’s Second Coming, about a working-class black family touched by metaphysics. Most working-class people are neither thugs nor saints but as mixed-up as the average executive – and the best films hold two thoughts at once. Billy Liar was an absurdist frolic with a brutal punchline Ramsay’s eponymous Morvern Callar a blank young raver from a Scottish supermarket who became the heart of a shimmering Spanish road movie.But it is hard to contain multitudes when working-class lives are treated as a niche. It also defies demographics. With class, the situation has never been one in which a small group of people have been shut out of British film rather, a small group of people have shut themselves inside it. The consequences ripple through everything from the sniggery classism of Matthew Vaughn’s Kingsman movies to the British Board of Film Classification awarding a 15 certificate to the recent documentary A Northern Soul (too many “fucks” in the wrong accent) to the very cinemas in which prestige British films typically play, the expanding boutique chains Everyman, Picturehouse and Curzon.Economically, short-term salvation lies in the middle-class pound that extends to wine and gourmet popcorn. But the exclusion of the young, skint and state educated from a mass market art form is a shame – and flatly suicidal in the age of Netflix. If the problem is vast, a mirror of the whole British class system, it is also deceptively simple. People like to see people like themselves on screen and be able to afford a ticket.

Last spring’s League Cup winners should be enhanced by the gifted Scotland midfielder Kim Little’s recovery from a serious knee injury. They possess significant talent in England midfielder Jordan Nobbs and the fast-maturing striker Beth Mead and can only benefit from the recruitment of the tempo-controlling Switzerland midfielder Lia Walti from Turbine Potsdam. Can they really better last season’s third-place finish, though?Marc Skinner’s side play an attractive, possession game and have the advantage of being able to deploy the England striker Ellen White at centre‑forward. Skinner looks to have made a good signing in Lucy Staniforth, a midfielder who has just broken into the England squad. Further forward, the England Under-20s forward Charlie Wellings can trouble the best defences. Despite key players suffering injuries and illness, Birmingham finished fifth last season but they will miss Jess Carter, a talented defender snapped up by Chelsea.Hope Powell’s side finished runners‑up in the second tier last season behind Doncaster Belles but were awarded a top-flight licence in the restructured WSL by the FA. Now Powell, a former England coach, must prove they deserve it. Much may hinge on Ini Umotong, a prolific Nigerian striker who averaged a goal every other game last season, reprising that form at the highest level. She will be supported by Ellie Brazil, daughter of Alan and newly arrived from Fiorentina. Powell possesses some bright young prospects, including Chloe Peplow, but has added useful experience in the shape of the imposing former Sunderland defender Victoria Williams and Wales’s former Yeovil utility player Kayleigh Green.Bristol finished a modest eighth but much has changed during the summer. Willie Kirk, the former manager, has left to assist Casey Stoney at Manchester United and Tanya Oxtoby is now in charge. The 36-year-old Australian holds an MA in sports psychology and arrives from Birmingham where, as Marc Skinner’s assistant, she concentrated on out‑of‑possession coaching. Oxtoby has refreshed the squad, making some interesting signings, most notably the Wales left-back Gemma Evans, previously of Yeovil, the New Zealand striker Katie Rood, who has joined following a frustrating season at Juventus, and Scotland’s former Hibernian midfielder Lucy Graham.Can last season’s champions and FA Cup winners repeat that feat while also enjoying Champions League success? Emma Hayes is combining management with motherhood after giving birth to a son in May, the inspirational captain Katie Chapman has retired and Claire Rafferty, Eni Aluko and Gilly Flaherty have moved on. While much will once again depend on Fran Kirby’s goals and brilliance at playing between the lines, Jess Carter looks a good defensive signing from Birmingham. Ditto Ali Riley, the New Zealand captain, acquired from Rosengard in Sweden. Hayes’s team appear formidably strong in every area of the pitch.Andy Spence is hoping for a significant improvement from his team following last season’s disappointing ninth place. Inessa Kaagman, a Dutch midfielder with an eye for goal, should prove a dynamic acquisition from Ajax and will play alongside her compatriot Dominique Bruinenberg, recruited from Sunderland, in a revamped engine room. The key defender is Gabby George, a cousin of Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard, who last year made history by becoming Everton’s first female player to turn fully professional. She will aim to continue her progress and secure a place in England’s World Cup squad.Neil Redfearn, Liverpool’s new manager, has arguably the best CV in the domestic women’s game. The first former coach of a Football League club to work in the WSL, he managed Leeds and Rotherham in the Championship and played Premier League football for Barnsley, Charlton and Bradford. Last season the 53‑year‑old, who has appointed the former England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland to his coaching staff, led Doncaster Belles to the second tier title but he has inherited a club in turmoil. Unhappiness under Scott Rogers prompted a summer exodus of 12 of the squad who finished sixth, with several defecting to Casey Stoney’s Manchester United. Redfearn has made 10 signings, including the vastly experienced defender and former Doncaster captain Leandra Little.Nick Cushing’s passing, technically assuredside finished second and narrowly missed out on all the other big prizes last season and are keen to atone for that unscheduled lack of silverware. While the striker Lauren Hemp, the PFA young player of the year, is an exciting acquisition from Bristol City, the midfielder Izzy Christiansen’s departure for Lyon – where she joins her much-missed former City teammate Lucy Bronze – is a blow. A squad packed with England internationals are embellished by two new forwards: Canada’s Janine Beckie, signed from Sky Blue FC, and Belgium’s Tessa Wullaert, previously of Wolfsburg. With so many players World Cup-bound next summer, Cushing must somehow find a way to avoid the fatigue that afflicted his England contingent so badly last spring.Kelly Chambers led her team to a deserved fourth place in May and that standing reflects the presence of some very good and extremely experienced players, including Jo Potter, Jade Moore, Natasha Harding and the wonderful Fara Williams. There is also emerging talent, most notably the forward Lauren Bruton, who has just broken into Phil Neville’s England squad. While the loss of the Lionesses’ goalkeeper Mary Earps to Wolfsburg was regrettable, Chambers has replaced her with the excellent Rachael Laws from Sunderland, while the acquisition of the former Chelsea winger Gemma Davison appears astute. Another strong campaign surely beckons for a team well capable of ruffling the feathers of the elite.Catapulted from the third tier of the English game to the top flight after the FA controversially awarded them a licence, ambitious West Ham have hired a leading coach in Matt Beard. Most recently in charge of the now defunct Boston Breakers in the United States, Beard won two WSL titles during a stint at Liverpool and has recruited 15 new players this summer, including the experienced former Chelsea defenders Claire Rafferty and Gilly Flaherty and the former Manchester City striker Jane Ross. It never quite worked out for the Scotland star at City but Ross could prove pivotal for West Ham. Like Liverpool, though, this team will take time to gel.Bottom-place Yeovil collected only two league points and scored just two goals - during a late season renaissance - last season but somehow persuaded the FA to offer them a place in the revamped WSL. Unusually, they are a self-sustaining club, receiving no help from the men’s team they share a name with, and it took a crowdfunding initiative to raise sufficient money to win that FA licence. With the new rules precluding the former manager Jamie Sherwood combining coaching with a teaching job, the highly regarded Lee Burch has been hired from Millwall Lionesses. Burch has reshuffled the squad but, crucially, Megan Walsh, a damage-limiting hero in goal last season, remains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60d4e698b774234219e27ae56fe5606f8457c585/0_346_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4fcd67d302f32af20da9d3ad81065e4","title":"peter taylor dagenham and redbridge football reality check","story":"The man who made David Beckham England captain is now relishing the challenge of managing cash-strapped Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge in English football’s fifth tierPeter Taylor, the one-time England manager, is fighting for survival at the foot of the National League with Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge. The reaction to the latest stop in the 65-year-old’s itinerant career has been consistent. Wow! And also, why?This is not the sort of move former England managers make. Who could envisage, say, Sven-Göran Eriksson – the man for whom Taylor kept the England seat warm on a caretaker basis in 2000 – at Braintree or Boreham Wood? “Ha. No, definitely not,” Taylor says, with a smile.He is a natural teller of stories, warm and engaging company even if his tough streak is easy to discern and he brings up one about an encounter he had on returning to his native Essex in 2012 after his time with Bahrain. “I’d gone for a walk with my wife and a fella stopped me and said: ‘Peter Taylor, isn’t it?’” he says. “I said: ‘Yeah,’ and he said: ‘You’ll never die wondering, will you?’ I thought to myself: ‘That’s a good title for my autobiography.’”Taylor’s 32 years in management have seen him take charge of 15 clubs, with three separate spells at Gillingham. The most far-flung destination was in India, with Kerala Blasters. At international level, there was Bahrain, two stints with the England Under-21s, one with the Under-20s, and, of course, that single game at the helm of the senior team. A 1-0 friendly defeat against Italy in Turin was memorable for Taylor’s decision to hand the captaincy to a bloke called David Beckham. To complete the picture, Taylor has been the assistant manager at Watford and the New Zealand national team, when he was based in England.Taylor went into Dagenham over the summer with his eyes wide open. He knew about the financial problems created when the then majority shareholder, Glyn Hopkin, withdrew his funding – which was compensating for an overspend – at the end of last year. Hopkin would resign as a director in February.From the turn of the year to the end of last season, Dagenham were £250,000 short of meeting their commitments. It has been a fraught period, in which they have battled to stay afloat by offloading players. West Ham helped them out by visiting for a friendly at Victoria Road in March while Hopkin made a substantial donation in order to help them pay the wage bill. The reality of the constraints on Taylor have nevertheless been bracing. He has operated on a budget one third the size of last season’s and there is the clear sense every penny is accounted for.Dagenham no longer even feed their players after training. The squad bring in their own food, which they heat in the microwave at the clubhouse. “We give them a breakfast,” Taylor says. “It’s cereals, toast, fruit. The lady here does marvellous. I think the maximum it costs her for all the players is £30 a week. They bring their own stuff for lunches.“Steve Thompson, the managing director, told me they had fed the players last season and it cost a few bob. I said: ‘If I do away with that, can I have a fitness coach to come in twice a week?’ Steve said yes.”The travel arrangements for away matches have been affected. The club have asked the players to drive themselves to stadiums that are less than 100 miles away while overnight accommodation for longer trips has been done away with. Last seasonthey stayed over before the Barrow game but for Saturday’s visit to the Cumbrian club, they were on the 8.30am train from Euston to Lancaster, before a 70-minute coach ride to Barrow-in-Furness. And again, the players take packed lunches.Taylor has leaned heavily on his contacts, pulling in favours to get players in on loan for nothing. The key to those deals was a promise that they would play, with the prospect of improving under Taylor an added benefit. He says that some of his other squad members are on £200 a week.“I’ve had a load of people trying to trial or come and train with us and I say: ‘You realise I’ve got no money?’” Taylor says. “They probably think: ‘Yeah, he’s got some money.’ But we’ve got no money. A scout wants to do some work for us and I say: ‘We’ve got no money. We can’t give you 40p a mile.’ It’s been a bit embarrassing in some ways.“I’m doing an after-dinner speech on 28 September and it’s to help pay for the goalie coach. Talk about singing for your supper. I’ll just talk about my experiences – like when I was a Tottenham player with the Argentinians, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa. They didn’t understand English if it meant running up and down but they understood English easy enough if it meant getting £250 to open a sports shop.”Taylor won four caps for England as a winger but is no stranger to life at the other end of the spectrum. He finished his playing career with spells at Maidstone, Heybridge Swifts, Chelmsford and Dartford – he was the player-manager at the last of these – while he has worked as a manager at Enfield, Hendon, Dover and Stevenage when they were a non-league club.Taylor has even seen the upside to Dagenham’s lack of money. It has meant the squad are packed with young players – more senior ones are unaffordable – and he has always enjoyed working with youngsters. For his one England game, he famously called up a host of under-21s.The downside is young players make mistakes and Dagenham have been punished this season. They had to wait until Tuesday for their first victory – a 1-0 home win over Braintree. Yet Taylor’s glass is resolutely half full and not only because the club are in advanced talks with a consortium of American investors who promise financial stability.“I’ve had good friends ring me up and I think they’re expecting me to be all down,” Taylor says. “But I’m the opposite. They’ve said: ‘Blimey, we didn’t expect you to be so upbeat.’ That’s the romance of it all, I suppose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108dd69db0f5d66ef648a28032d6bc16a34f6bc1/472_44_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2908c9e5ca425385256e4b1458565c1","title":"nations league northern ireland bosnia herzegovina","story":"32 min: Another Northern Ireland corner. The ball’s swung in to the Bosnia penalty area, where the referee spots an infringement on Ervin Zukanovic and awards a free-kick. Bosnia clear their lines.31 min: Miralem Pjanic is booked for a trip on George Saville, moments after Dzeko had fired straight at Northern Ireland goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell.29 min: Another good cross from Conor McLoughlin, who tries to pick out Kyle Lafferty near the penalty spot. The ball’s put out for a corner by Toni Sunjic and Lafferty gives his provider a thumbs-up. 27 min: With almost a third of the match gone, it’s difficult to understand how Northern Ireland aren’t in front. They’ve completely outplayed their visitors, whose full-backs look extremely vulnerable indeed. Bosnia are struggling to get the ball out of their own half and Edin Dzeko has barely had a touch.27 min: Kyle Lafferty wins a corner for Northern Ireland, but the ensuing inswinger is cleared at the near post.26 min: At the other end of the field, Besic runs the ball out of play and clatters into an advertising hoarding. The fans nearby are predictably sympathetic. 24 min: Dallas releases Jamal Lewis with a clever pass down the left wing, but Muhamed Besic is able to get back and put a stop to the midfielder’s gallop. 23 min: Now Steven Davis tries his luck, shooting high and wide from the edge of the Bosnia penalty area. 22 min: Stuart Dallas shoots high and wide from distance. The score remains 0-0, but Bosnia are getting slaughtered here. 20 min: Relentless pressure from Northern Ireland. This time, Conor McLaughlin sends in a cross and George Saville comes this close to sliding it home from the edge of the six-yard box.17 min: Niall McGinn is absolutely roasting Civic down the right wing. He beats him for speed again and gets in a cross, which is headed clear. The ball comes back towards McGinn and he drives towards the penalty area and unleashes a diagonal rasper that Ibrahim Sehic can only parry clear. 16 min: Already on a yellow card, Civic sarcastically applauds the referee after being correctly penalised for barging into Craig Cathcart. The word’s “disciplinary” and “tightrope” spring to mind. 14 min: Niall McGinn makes an over-lapping run down the right flank and picks up the ball from Steven Davis. He takes it past Civic and sends in a cross, but it’s too high for Kyle Lafferty.12 min: Bosnia get forward with Miralem Pjanic on the ball. He plays it to Haris Duljevic on the left flank, but the winger controls the ball with his hand under pressure from a green shirt. Northern Ireland are doing very well here.10 min: Bosnia left-back Eldar Civic gets yellow card for a bad tackle on Steven Davis. It was late and high and the Sparta Prague man is perhaps lucky he didn’t get sent off. Remember, Bosnia have no defensive cover on their bench. Roberet Prosinecki only brought four fit defenders and found out yesterday that one of them is suspended. 8 min: Bosnia are struggling to settle here, their players apparently rattled by Northern Ireland’s intense, in-your-face approach. The visitors have already abandoned their plan to play the ball out from the back and goalkeeper Ibrahim Sehic is now lumping the ball forward with gay abandon. 7 min: Bosnia win a free-kick wide on the left, halfway inside the Northern Ireland half. Miralem Pjanic’s whipped cross from deep bounces straight through to Bailey Peacock-Farrell in the Northern Ireland goal.5 min: Gojko Cimirot handles the ball a few yards outside his own penalty area, giving Northern Ireland a free-kick in a good position. Oliver Norwood shoots over the bar.4 min: It’s been a lively start and Northern Ireland have roared out of the traps, buoyed by the enthusiasm of their vocal home support. Northern Ireland have clearly opted to target Muhamed Besic, who is looking uncomfortable in his unfamiliar role as a makeshift right-back.1 min: There’s an early shout for a penalty as George Saville goes down under a challenge from Ervin Zukanovic in the Bosnia penalty area. The referee isn’t having it and waves play on. Replays suggest that Northern Ireland’s incensed fans have every right to be annoyed. 1 min: Following a minute’s applause for the late Northern Ireland and Burnley legend Jimmy McIlroy, play gets under way. Northern Ireland kick off, playing in green shirts, white shorts and green socks. Bosnia – with apologies to “Herzegovina” – play in white shirts, blue shorts and white socks.Not long now: The teams march out on to the pitch to a warm round of applause from what looks like a full house. Bosnia and Herzegovina have brought around 300 fans for today’s contest. A handful of them appear to be wearing military style camouflage jackets and sunglasses, which is quite a bold fashion statement given the location. A presentation: Steven Davis is making his 102nd appearance for Northern Ireland today. The Southampton midfielder was presented with a commemorative cap pitch-side before the game, to mark his century.A weird nugget of trivia from Sky Sports: For unexplained reasons, Robert Prosinecki has only brought four defenders to Belfast and one of them is – you won’t believe this – suspended from his time in the under-21s. Hence the presence of midfielder Muhamed Besic at right-back. Bosnia and Herzegovina: Sehic, Civic, Besic, Sunjic, Zukanovic, Pjanic, Cimirot, Saric, Visca, Duljevic, DzekoLeeds goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell gets the nod to make his first competitive start for Northern Ireland. The 21-year-old, whose only previous appearance came as a substitute in the goalless friendly with Panama in May, was preferred ahead of Michael McGovern and Trevor Carson. Captain Steven Davis returned after missing the trip to Central America through injury. Josh Magennis misses out through injury, while Kyle Lafferty starts up front.Bosnia coach Robert Prosinecki includes captain Edin Dzeko and Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic in his line-up. Middlesbrough midfielder Muhamed Besic, on loan from Everton, will line up at right-back with Darko Todorovic suspended.“This is an interesting tournament because it is a chance to go to the European Championship,” said Bosnia and Herzegovina’s manager. “It’s more interesting than friendly matches: we’ve got good opponents with several top class players. It’s going to be a good test for us. We believe in the squad, they have shown that they can play, and we will play to win against Northern Ireland. We are preparing well.”League A, Group 1: Germany 0-0 FranceB1: Czech Republic 1-2 UkraineB4: Wales 4-1 Republic of IrelandC3: Slovenia 1-2 Bulgaria, Norway 2-0 CyprusD1: Kazakhstan 0-2 Georgia, Latvia 0-0 AndorraD4: Armenia 2-1 Liechtenstein, Gibraltar 0-2 Macedonia“It will be a tough game, there is no doubt about that,” said Northern Ireland’s manager in the build-up to today’s game. “They were unlucky to miss out on a play-off spot for the World Cup finals, like ourselves. They lost one game really - it was Cyprus that cost them. “They have Miralem Pjanic, who is one of the top midfielders in Europe, and Edin Dzeko, a renowned European striker as well. I think they will provide a tough, tough game for us with Robert Prosinecki coming in for his first competitive game - they will prove a very stiff challenge.” Hearts defender Aaron Hughes has been ruled out with a calf injury and has returned to Edinburgh for treatment, while Bolton Wanderers striker Josh Magennis is also in doubt after missing training with a calf niggle of his own yesterday. Magennis, Kyle Lafferty, Liam Boyce and Will Grigg are all vying for starting positions up front, while manager Michael O’Neill must choose his goalkeeper from the trio of Trevor Carson, Bailey Peacock-Farrell and Michael McGovern. Bosnia and Herzogovina are managed by one-time Portsmouth legend Robert Prosinecki and number Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic among the star players they have brought to Belfast. Bojan Nastic, Ermin Bicakcica and Ognjen Vranjes have all been ruled out through injury, while left-back Eldar Civic is a major doubt.Still struggling to get to grips with the competition’s format?

The almost 20-year friendship has been strong, with Kesolei saying “every Palauan has a story” of interaction with Taiwan, whether travelling there for a holiday, education or medical treatment.But Taiwan’s allies are slowly being chipped away, as China puts the pressure on and seeks to penalise those that recognise self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers a Chinese territory. El Salvador switched its allegiance last month, and Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic severed ties with Taiwan earlier this year.Those countries that continue to recognise Taiwan – particularly the six Taiwanese allies located in the Pacific, where China is seeking to increase its influence – are feeling the pressure.In November 2017, the Chinese government ordered tour operators to stop selling package tours to Palau, with reports that doing so could lead to fines.Some insist Palau has always been a blacklisted destination but that until recently the Chinese government turned a blind eye.Evan Rees, Asia-Pacific analyst at Stratfor, says China uses such bans – as well as the granting and withholding of Approved Destination Status (ADS) to countries – as “part of a larger toolkit for compelling behaviour”.Last year, South Korea was the subject of such a travel ban, after a row over its deployment of a US missile defence system, which had a devastating impact on tourism to the country during the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. One Palauan-based Chinese businessman said the word “Palau” had also been blocked as an internet search term in China.The impact of the ban on Palau has been stark.The number of tourists from China has plummeted so dramatically that one airline flying charter flights between China and Palau stopped flights at the end of August, because “the Chinese government made Palau an illegal tour destination possibly and most likely due to lack of diplomatic status”.Palauan tour operators and government officials bridle at suggestions the ban has brought Palau to its knees – there were still 9,000 visitor arrivals in July – but occupancy rates at hotels have dropped and businesses are hurting.At Elilai restuarant, which is heavily promoted as the “best restaurant in Palau” on billboards all over the island, I am the sole diner in a restaurant that could comfortably accommodate 50.Waitress Donita Rose Cagaoan-Tipay is apologetic about the empty room, saying it was the result of a “ban from China”, though she says she doesn’t know much more about it than that.“I asked my friend who is a Chinese tour guide, he said Palau and China, the governments are having a fight,” she explains.The empty restaurants are a far cry from 2014 and 2015, when charter flights from China began landing every day each carrying hundreds of tourists.Leilani Reklai says the impact on the island was overwhelming. “Guys were running around town buying land, getting cash in suitcases and buying everything in sight,” says Reklai, who is the president of Palau’s tourism association.Reklai owned two boats that took tour groups to the Rock Islands, the most famous of Palau’s tourist attractions, which before the Chinese boom would go out four days a week during peak season.“But for almost one year my guys were going out seven days a week” she says.“Some people were saying ‘This is the Chinese strategy, this is what they do, they are going to pour a lot of money in here, and get you addicted like it’s Coke and then turn off the faucet’. But of course, money was louder so people weren’t listening,” says Reklai.At 70, Francis Toribiong has had almost every job in the tourism business. He says the dip hurt “everybody”. Toribiong has been forced to sell a 25-bed hostel but says he got off relatively lightly.“There are so many young men who went to the development bank and borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy boats,” he says. Now, demand has dropped so much that they are lucky if they are able to make enough to cover fuel and the loan repayments.Despite the pain, most people agree the boom was unsustainable.At its peak in 2015, 169,000 tourists arrived in Palau and the country’s power, water and sewage systems struggled to cope. There was huge inflation, and the price of food and rent skyrocketed.Kevin Mesebeluu, director of the bureau of tourism, says the China ban may be “a blessing in disguise”, giving Palau a chance to reevaluate its approach to tourism.“The president has been very clear about the direction,” he said. “High-value, low-impact sustainable tourism.”Indeed, the country was heading down this path before the ban came into effect. In 2015, Palau’s president, Tommy Remengesau, announced a reduction in the number of charter flights between China and Palau, in response to environmental and social concerns.Reklani thinks this decision, which came into effect gradually, means Palau escaped much more serious financial trouble. “We definitely got out in time, this pain we’re going through, it would have been so much worse,” she says.Since the China ban, Remengesau has reiterated his commitment to Taiwan, telling the Nikkei Asian Review that while China was an “important partner” Palau had “more in common with Taiwan”.A statement from his spokesperson was even more defiant, suggesting Palau would not bow to pressure: “Palau is a country of laws, it is a democracy and we make our own decisions.”However, there are others who would not mind seeing Palau switch diplomatic horses.“It’s about time that we focus our interests and views towards the People’s Republic of China,” said Senate president Hokkons Baules in July at the groundbreaking ceremony for a Chinese-backed resort, according to the Island Times.The China-Taiwan question is expected to be a key issue at the next presidential election in 2020. But the Taiwanese ambassador to Palau, Wallace Chow, says he is not worried about the relationship, saying it is “very solid”.Speaking to  during an event for 25 Taiwanese youth ambassadors who are spending several days in Palau as part of a “soft power” mission, Chow says it is this “down-to-earth, to the people, for the people” approach that will keep Palau onside.But Palauans may also be persuaded by the more than $10m in aid provided by Taiwan to the country each year, reminders of which are dotted around the island as signs announce that road or building projects are funded by Taiwanese grant money.“I’m very confident that the Palauan people know who is their true partner and which side their bread is buttered,” said Chow.Under the slowly moving fans, Kesolei says he does not expect a diplomatic switch anytime soon. “It’s part of our culture that we are very loyal to our friends,” he says.Palauans also like the image of themselves as a country that is standing up to a superpower."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289c288ede69e2e8b85a37244a2db9406187502/0_545_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a884829a07c5ae29ce8dc7ddf9b4ae","title":"should i limit the amount of time my child spends with their mobile phone","story":"Children and parents may not agree on how much screen time is acceptable, but some ground rules about usage and online security will make for a more harmonious householdIt’s an argument virtually every modern parent has had with their child: the battle to prise them away from the mobile phone they’re glued to. For children, a smartphone is a window to games, videos and constant interaction with their friends. But for parents, it can feel like a minefield, raising questions about whether their access should be restricted and how to keep them safe as they learn to navigate the digital world. But who’s in the right?First, it’s worth bearing in mind that screen time can be beneficial. Peter Twining, professor of education (futures) at the Open University, conducted research between 2015 and 2017 into mobile phone use among five- to 11-year-olds, and his findings about what children use phones to access may surprise parents who assume they’re just playing games. “We tend not to recognise the value of what they do on their mobile devices, but they often use them to extend an interest – for instance, if they’re interested in gymnastics, they’ll watch videos of routines and try to learn from them,” he says.This difference in understanding of children’s mobile phone usage may help to explain the substantial disparity in opinion between children and parents about how much screen time is acceptable. According to a survey of 1,000 adults and 1,000 children aged nine to 15 conducted by Tesco Mobile, the mean amount of screen time that adults thought appropriate for children was 1.75 hours, with children believing it to be 3.34 hours.But at least both parties do recognise that there should be limits. However, recent research suggests that instead of setting specific time limits for usage, such as a maximum of two hours per day, it’s actually the nature of the screen time that matters. For instance, passively flicking through social media posts is less beneficial than actively playing games, which can improve problem-solving skills and persistence. A study conducted by the University of Michigan on four to 11-year-olds found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction.”Twining agrees, saying: “I’m less concerned about screen time than about the nature of the interactions around the screen. The screen should become a shared focal point for interaction within the family rather than an inidual activity. The screen shouldn’t be an alternative to socialising with your child, it should be an enhancement to it.”Some experts believe that rather than setting concrete limits to screen time, it may be more useful to establish general house rules about the context of phone use. “Many families find a unified screen time approach beneficial,” says chartered psychologist Dr Sarah Kuppen, author of Little Kids, Big Dilemmas: Your parenting problems solved by science.“A media plan sets limits on screen usage to ensure children access a wide range of daily activities. Restrictions sometimes include screen-free zones, screen-free times or device curfews. However, these should be adapted and updated over time.”According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – these family guidelines are crucial. “You need to set a good example with your own device and any rules you create, be careful not to break them yourself. For instance, we never have our phones at the dinner table so we can all interact together offline.”Other suggestions from Papadopoulos include only letting children have their phones after their homework, and never allowing them to sleep with the device. She advises explaining the reasons behind these rules. “We know it’s a bad idea to use the phone just before bed because it causes sleep disturbance, so they need to get off it at least a couple of hours before. Equally, we know if a child is studying and their phone is pinging next to them, they won’t consolidate memory, so the chapter they’re reading will take twice as long to absorb. The more kids understand why you’re making these rules, the more they’ll live by them.“And if you still feel they’re using their phones too much, technology can actually help – there are apps where children are rewarded for taking time away from their tech.”Twining believes that parents know what’s appropriate, so they should trust their instincts. “They’re sometimes nervous about exercising it, but parents usually have really good common sense,” he says. “If children are on their phone all the time, clearly that’s too much – you want them to do other activities, too. The key is finding a balance.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274848e4e0be4abbac76fb3a11e637550fbba17/0_22_6303_3783/master/6303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd0a7880d017df9dc47418a0d5aa086e 620w","title":"knickers truth about trying open relationship","story":"Non-monogamy seems to be having a moment. Would it work for us?Sam and I have been together for almost a year now, and I don’t think he took me seriously when I first, briefly, mentioned that perhaps monogamy wasn’t for me (“I thought it was just one of your affectations,” he said). But as time has worn on, we’ve butted up against my resolve like rubber ducks against an iceberg. “I feel like you’re doing it because it’s…” he looks disgusted… “trendy.”Non-monogamy seems to be having a moment. An umbrella term, it encompasses the range of relationship configurations that can come about if you decide that “one for life” isn’t quite for you.“We’re finally rejecting old binaries,” says the comedian Rosie Wilby, author of Is Monogamy Dead? “As we think in a more sophisticated way about gender and gender identity, and about sexuality, it’s natural that we’ve also begun to question the structure of our relationships. All those conversations feed into one another.”I’ve never been a hardline monogamist. In my last (monogamous) relationship, I always contended that if my partner slept with someone else, it wouldn’t necessarily mean that it was, y’know, done. It seemed reductive to boil down the suppers, red-wine-stained kisses, whispered secrets, adventures and grievances and confidences we shared, the sheer everything of a relationship, to a shag. If our relationship existed on so many levels – friends, teammates, confidantes, lovers – then it couldn’t be undone by one act and that’s quite a noble thought, isn’t it? Polyamory has been getting a lot of press. It basically means having concurrent relationships with more than one person. You might have one primary, but everyone you choose to be with is more or less equal in your affections. My preferred configuration isn’t actually that radical: ethical non-monogamy is basically a good old-fashioned open relationship. There would only ever be two of us in it, but I’d like to trust that person so implicitly, and value them so wholeheartedly, that if they slept with someone else it wouldn’t damage us. I’d like for the other person to trust and value me just as much so that if I did the same, we’d be able to look at it for what it is: a banal act that is fun or weird or intimate or exciting, but ultimately not a threat to our harmony.“A sort of flexitarian approach to relationships,” I said to Sam. “You have a primary partner, and they’re the important one… ” He rolled his eyes, and I told him he was being too middle class about it. “Me just wanting a normal relationship, where you don’t sleep with other people? I’m not sure that’s quite Volvo territory,” he replied.Finally, he admitted to me: “Maybe because of the traditional expectations that are put on men, it’s more difficult for us to be open about it. There’s something a bit embarrassing about the woman you’re dating wanting to sleep with other people as if maybe you’re inadequate.”Earlier this year we’d reached something of an impasse, so I took Sam to a talk that Wilby was giving above a pub in London. Soon enough, we were packed in with 83 others – mainly slightly older couples and groups of female friends.“It’s quite a scary concept,” Wilby said. “Because we don’t like the idea of our partner being with someone else. But generally, it’s because we’ve been taught to believe this means that our partner will leave us. Of course,” she continued, “the key point of non-monogamy is that even though your partner might be with another lover, they’re actually coming back to you. And that extra joy and love and happiness might even fuel and rekindle the relationship they have with you. We’ve been conditioned to believe other people are a threat to our relationships, but what if they aren’t?”I soon put this to the test, when Sam failed to meet me one night as promised and instead went home with another woman. I felt perturbed: “But you said you might come and meet me.”He sighed. “Am I meant to apologise? You said it was fine as long as we’re honest.”I sat sulkily for a while. “Well as long as you had fun, Sam.”A little scab developed over the wound of not being chosen over a nameless woman in a shitty bar. Still, I eventually wriggled into a comfortable emotional spot about this one, too. “I’m totally fine about it now,” I said a few weeks later.The truth is, of course, that it’s incredibly tricky, and not something you can just foist on someone if they’re not keen. As Wilby points out, though: “Having the conversation, instead of just tacitly accepting monogamy as the only option, is really half the battle.” And we have had the conversation, over and over with each other, but also with others – incredulous friends who can’t quite believe that it’s “a thing”. We field the questions in turn: no, it’s not perfect yes, we do row sometimes yes, there are rules no, we don’t know how long it’ll last. But it is “a thing” – although, after almost a year together, not in the way that I thought it would be. Sam has slept with more people than I have. Despite pushing for it, when the opportunities have arisen I’ve found it oddly difficult to switch into the necessary head space. There’s still a faint feeling of betrayal and I wonder whether the deed will be worth the emotional cost. More often than not, I realise it won’t be. I’m not sure he feels it in quite the same way. And, yes, sometimes I get tense and irritable when we sit down to eat and he’s too tired to talk because he spent half the night with someone else.Still, I prefer it this way. We can be really, brutally honest with one another without the fear of damaging our relationship. As far as I’m concerned, hardline monogamy is a recipe for disappointment, because even if you manage it (according to a poll by YouGov about one in five of us has had an affair, and a third of us consider it), there will always be a part of you – that bit that has crushes on colleagues, and fantasises about handsome strangers – that your partner cannot share. There will always be secrets.To me, ethical non-monogamy isn’t about sex, or rather, not just about sex to me, it’s more about radical compassion – accepting that if you plan to spend a lifetime together, you or your partner or both of you will have those urges and fantasies, but, despite that, you’ll be there for each other. You’ll love each other, no matter who or what else comes along. Back in the pub, towards the end of Wilby’s talk, we learned about relationship anarchy a woman in the audience was trying it out. A relationship anarchist rejects any rules or constraints, they have multiple partners but no one is more important than another, and sexual, romantic or platonic relationships are all given equal weight. Basically, different partners respond to different needs. “If me and my best friend don’t fit sexually, but know that we’d make great co-parents, then why shouldn’t that be OK?” asked the woman. Six months on, I’m still quite taken with this idea.Maybe we should just burn them all down, these narrow streets that we’ve paved so that our desires move in straight lines. I have grieved, really grieved, over the loss of old relationships. I think of the heartbreak when Wilby says, “One of the key issues with the traditional format of exclusive, romantic relationships is that there’s an assumption that unless it lasts for ever, it is a failed relationship – when it might have been good for 10 or 20 years, when it might still be good, but for a change in one element.”Maybe it’s not committed relationships that non-monogamists are rejecting, but the idea that those relationships have to end when the romantic part does. And isn’t that desire – to keep those crucial people in your life – deeply romantic in its own way?Non-monogamy might not be the answer to any of this, but at least it’s asking the question.

I thought I\u0026nbsphad this horrible foreign sounding name when I was young because there was so much hostility towards “foreigners” after the war. The kids at school used to call me things like Albert or Albatross.My mother taught me to be a rebel. She would always point out inequality and did far more to make me a punk than those spotty boys I met afterwards in bands. By the time I got my period I was a ball of fury because I was a woman and knew life was going to be harder for me. My mother gave me the bottle to pick up a guitar when not many other girls dared to.Being in a punk band was very, very hard work. It wasn’t like going to festivals and hanging out and having a\u0026nbsplovely sunny time. You constantly felt the pressure of other people you respected watching and criticising what you did.I could easily be a hermit. It’s an effort to leave the house. I’m a natural introvert everything that’s offered me I want to say no to. It’s almost easier to deal with an anonymous audience or readership than people I’m close to. When I write books it’s like ripping out my insides, but I want to tear apart any illusion of myself so young women can read an honest life of failure, dumping, sacking – and know they can be creative, too.Vivienne Westwood was my first role model. She was an extremely rigorous thinker and it mattered to us what she thought. I don’t think she is given enough credit for this, but she very much set the tone for what became known as punk.Being an older mother gave me a bit more wisdom. If I had done it younger, I might have been more stifling. I think you have to stand back and let your child grow into who they are. My mother filled me with adventurousness and anger and sometimes I wonder if I really was a rebel or whether she imposed it upon me.I feel horror at the thought of another relationship. In the west we force people to be teenagers all their lives. It’s horrible. My mind is beginning to clear of believing in romance and fairy-tale endings. When you unchain yourself from your sexual drive and your drive to have an ideal partner, the space you’re left with doesn’t stay empty, it fills up with creativity.It’s a weakness to want to be adored. People who have rediscovered the Slits come up to me and say, “Viv, you’re a\u0026nbsplegend!” and I think, “I’m not a fucking legend, my God”.

Stag dos and hen parties in Las Vegas or Ibiza or Amsterdam, glitzy foreign and “multi-day” weddings, multiple outfits to avoid being photographed in the same dress or suit ... some twenty- and thirtysomethings say they are wiping out their savings and building up debts as a result of attending costly events.Take the case of Georgina Childs. In the space of just four years, the PR consultant attended 15 hen dos and 21 weddings, all of which set her back a staggering £10,000.“When I first started going to weddings in 2014, I lived at home with my parents,” says Childs, who is 30. “So without having a bulky amount of London rent to pay, it was easier to pay out for weddings. I bought new outfits, stayed in nice B\u0026ampBs with my friends and was generous with my wedding gifts.“At the time, I don’t think I realised quite how many weddings I would attend in the next four years and how much I would spend.”One wedding in Lake Garda in northern Italy cost Childs more than £650 once she had shelled out for transport, accommodation and a dress, while a hen do in Granada in Spain set her back a similar amount.“Retrospectively, I couldn’t really afford it and shouldn’t have gone,” she admits. By the end of 2017, she had racked up £2,000 on a credit card and was forced to move back in with her parents.In hindsight she wishes she had been more frugal from the start. “I could perhaps have looked at using the money as a flat deposit or even for travelling the world. Having said that, I have many memories with many friends.”According to two surveys this year, from planning website Bridebook and Brides magazine, the cost of the average “full” wedding has hit £30,000. However, the price is also spiralling out of control for guests, with those attending the nuptials splashing out an average of £1,015, according to a recent survey from loan provider Provident.“New outfits, wedding presents, travel and often accommodation costs all mean that a busy wedding season can end up being extremely costly for guests,” says Jack Duckett, senior consumer lifestyles analyst at Mintel. “While in the past guests may have recycled wedding garments, the omnipresence of social media arguably adds pressure to create new looks for every wedding, for fear of being photographed in the same outfit at multiple events.”When Gemma Robinson’s brother-in-law chose to get married in Cyprus last year, she had no idea it would end up costing an eye-watering £8,000 and “wipe out” their savings.“We had to go for a week because of the way the flights worked out,” says Robinson, from Manchester. The costs piled up after her husband and son were asked to be groomsmen, and her daughter a flower girl.“I assumed they would pay for their outfits, but they didn’t, so that meant my husband’s suit cost £200, and because she wanted the little boys to wear matching Hugo Boss shirts, that cost £70, and then we had to pay for Sarah’s flower girl dress, which cost £70, plus shoes which were £30.”The couple had already splashed out on an expensive family trip to the US just the month before, which they had already paid for. “We had to use money we’d received for our own wedding to pay for it. We were absolutely skint from it.”Jade Beer, editor of Condé Nast Brides magazine and author of The Almost Wife, also says that weddings today are becoming increasingly extravagant – and expensive. “In 2018, they can easily extend over more than two days and have an itinerary of activities that guests need to dress for, and which may require them to travel to different locations for different events. This is a huge personal investment before they’ve even thought about buying the couple a gift.”Jenna Harrison has attended upwards of 30 weddings and 15 hen dos in locations such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, New York and the Greek island of Mykonos over the past three years, costing her in the region of £30,000.She says there are additional costs because of the pressure to wear new outfits, which might cost about £250 each.“I mostly always buy something new to wear, partly because I work in fashion and partly because I don’t want to wear the same thing twice,” she says. “Often I will need two things because it’s become quite a trend to do something on the Friday night, too, like a drinks or welcome dinner, particularly for destination weddings.”With plenty of disposable income, Harrison says she has no regrets when it comes to spending such a large sum. “It would be nice to have extra money in the bank to put towards our new home but, truthfully, my husband and I love weddings so much. It’s money well spent in my mind.”But today, celebrating isn’t just tied to the nuptials themselves – many are encouraged to join extravagant hen and stag parties, which can cost guests an average of £164 each, according to Mintel.“The rising cost of stag and hen parties can be largely attributed to the increasing breadth of activities that groups look to include in their celebration, ranging from afternoon tea and wine tasting experiences to spa weekends away in foreign countries,” says Duckett.“This ties in with an overarching shift in consumer behaviour, which has seen people put greater emphasis on products and services that will offer unique experiences they will remember and that they can tell their friends about.”However, for some, spiralling wedding costs are just too much to bear. Chloe Minette, 22, from Bedford, admits she was forced to bow out of being maid of honour at her friend’s wedding after the costs kept creeping up. “She wanted to get married in Spain, but the bridesmaids had to pay to go over and were expected to be in Spain for a week. I started to panic as I’d just bought a house and couldn’t afford to go away for a week to Spain.”There was also talk of a hen do in Ibiza. “I texted her to explain calmly that financially I couldn’t do it ... we’ve not spoken since.”Like Minette, if you can’t afford the outlay, it’s best to be honest rather than getting yourself into debt. There are, of course, plenty of excuses you can use.“If you have children, blame them,” says Beer. “If you have a demanding boss, they can be your excuse. Dwindling holiday allowance, or having to attend solo due to a partner’s clashing diary requirements, are all acceptable.”If you aren’t going to attend, perhaps invite the couple to dinner post-honeymoon so they can tell you all about it, advises Beer.If you do decide to attend but are on a budget, you could cut costs by checking out Airbnbs, just staying over on the night of the wedding, and travelling together in a group.Kate Beavis, founder of the creative wedding blog Magpie Wedding, says guests can save money by creating their own gift or giving the gift of time – such as offering babysitting vouchers. “Some people may think this odd, but really, any good friend would understand and actually appreciate it. Don’t feel you have to buy a new outfit, either. Change the accessories or hat – or maybe you could borrow some.”When that invite lands on the doormat, Beer advises recipients to “press pause on any dramatic reactions until you’ve had time to process it all and decide what you’re in for – and what you’re not”.* Some names and places have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a1de7d5a3dfbefbe489543f089249ff90539854/0_0_4280_2567/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e439a223903be9b666b8f507f37314ba","title":"in transit eight of the best audiobooks for long journeys","story":"That hefty tome you’ve been meaning to read for years?

Simon Sebag Montefiore’s look at the history of the Romanovs – the dynasty of tsars and tsarinas who ruled Russia and its empire from the 17th century up until the revolutions of 1917 and the death of Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 – was well reviewed, but is a heavy book to carry around and get through. Simon Russell Beale, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in films The Death of Stalin and Into the Woods, reads it all for you, which makes it much easier to sort your tsarinas from your Tatianas and your Alexanders from your, er, other Alexanders.Ulysses by James Joyce, read by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan27 hrs 16 mins, equivalent to flying from London to WellingtonThis is probably one of those books you always thought you ought to manage if only you could summon the wherewithal.

Originally created by Ian Fleming and named after the author of a book on birds in the Caribbean, Bond has captured the imagination of writers, from Anthony Horowitz and John Gardner, to Kingsley Amis and Sebastian Faulks. This extraordinary, leviathan series – with readers including Bill Nighy, David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Bonneville – encompasses almost all of them.Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, read by Scott Brick35 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to cycling from Madrid to BarcelonaIt’s the musical that’s become a phenomenon: it’s been used to subtweet President Trump by the American Civil Liberties Union been poignantly performed in parts in front of Barack Obama in his last days of office and had its every line obsessed over by legions of fans across the world.

McCartney said he wondered “What’s the coolest station we could think of?” and settled on Grand Central. His band set up under a chandelier and in front of a giant clock, by the 42nd Street entrance.The 76-year-old performed hits like Let it Be, Can’t Buy Me Love, A Hard Day’s Night and Lady Madonna. He also dug deeper into his songbook for I’ve Got a Feeling, Hi Hi Hi and 1985.While he played three songs from his new album, McCartney did more from the 50-year-old White Album in front of a sweaty, dancing crowd.Seemingly nervous as he stood on a riser in the middle of the audience with an acoustic guitar for one song, he flubbed the words to Blackbird twice, starting over both times. Surrounding fans, famous and non-famous, knew all the lyrics and coaxed him on.“I know this song,” he said in frustration. “I wrote it.”Before singing the Beatles’ first single, Love Me Do, McCartney told of his nerves singing the chorus and said he can still hear it in his voice when he hears the recording.He also talked about a writing session with Kanye West. After a few days in the studio, he wasn’t sure they even had a song. A few months later, West sent him a copy of FourFiveSeconds, with Rihanna on lead vocals.“I rang him up and asked: ‘Am I on this song?”’ McCartney said. West said it included his guitar. At Grand Central, McCartney reclaimed it.Some members of the Beatles’ extended family were present. Sean Lennon, the son of McCartney’s late songwriting partner, was in the audience, as was McCartney’s wife, Nancy Shevell: he dedicated the song My Valentine to her. Giles Martin, son of longtime Beatles producer George Martin, was handling the concert’s sound.For a new song about bullying, McCartney invited two women from the audience to tell their stories about being treated poorly.“I got made fun of for being a Beatles fan,” one of them said. It earned her a hug.

In 2016, their report showed that the wealthiest 62 iniduals owned the same amount as the bottom half of the world’s population. This year, that number had dropped to 42: three-and-half-dozen people with as much stuff as three-and-a-half billion.This yearly ritual has become part of the news cycle, and the inequality it exposes has ceased to shock us. The very rich getting very much richer is now part of life, like the procession of the seasons. But we should be extremely concerned: their increased wealth gives them ever-greater control of our politics and of our media. Countries that were once democracies are becoming plutocracies plutocracies are becoming oligarchies oligarchies are becoming kleptocracies.Things were not always this way. In the years after the second world war, the trend was in the opposite direction: the poor were getting richer we were all getting more equal. To understand how and why that changed, we need to go back to the dying days of the conflict, to a resort in New Hampshire, where a group of economists set out to secure humanity’s future.This is the story of how their dream failed and how a London banker’s bright idea broke the world.In the years after the first world war, money flowed between countries pretty much however its owners wished, destabilising currencies and economies in pursuit of profit. Many of the wealthy grew wealthier even while economies fell apart. The chaos led to the election of extremist governments in Germany and elsewhere, to competitive devaluations and beggar-my-neighbour tariffs, to trade wars and, ultimately, to the horrors of the second world war.The allies wanted to prevent this ever happening again. So, at a meeting at the Bretton Woods resort in New Hampshire in 1944, they negotiated the details of an economic architecture that would – in perpetuity – stop uncontrolled money flows. This, they hoped, would keep governments from using trade as a weapon with which to bully neighbours, and create a stable system that would help secure peace and prosperity.Under the new system, all currencies would be pegged to the dollar, which would in turn be pegged to gold. An ounce of gold cost $35 (that’s about $500£394 today). In other words, the US Treasury pledged that, if a foreign government turned up with $35, it could always buy an ounce of gold. The United States was promising to keep everyone supplied with enough dollars to fund international trade, as well as to maintain sufficient gold reserves for those dollars to be inherently valuable.To prevent speculators trying to attack these fixed currencies, cross-border money flows were severely constrained. Money could move overseas, but only in the form of long-term investments, not to speculate short term against currencies or bonds.To understand how this system worked, imagine an oil tanker. If it has just one huge tank, then the oil can slosh backwards and forwards in ever greater waves, until it destabilises the vessel, which overturns and sinks. At the Bretton Woods conference, the oil was ided between smaller tanks, one for each country. The liquid could slosh back and forth within its little compartments, but would be unable to achieve enough momentum to damage the integrity of the vessel.Strangely, one of the best evocations of this long-gone system is Goldfinger, the James Bond book. The film of the same name has a slightly different plot, but they both feature an attempt to undermine the west’s financial system by interfering with its gold reserves. “Gold and currencies backed by gold are the foundations of our international credit,” a Bank of England official named Colonel Smithers explains to 007.The villain Auric Goldfinger’s cunning scheme is to own pawnbrokers all over Britain, buy up gold jewellery and trinkets from ordinary Brits in need of a bit of cash, then melt them down into plates, attach the plates to his Rolls-Royce, drive them to Switzerland, reprocess them and fly them to India. By doing so, Goldfinger will not only undermine the British currency and economy, but also earn profits he could use to fund communists and other miscreants. Hundreds of Bank of England employees are engaged in trying to stop this kind of scam from happening, Smithers tells 007, but Goldfinger is too clever for them. He has secretly become Britain’s richest man, and has £5m-worth of gold bars sitting in the vaults of a bank in the Bahamas.“We are asking you to bring Mr Goldfinger to book, Mr Bond, and get that gold back,” says Smithers. “You know about the currency crisis and the high Bank rate? Of course. Well, England needs that gold, badly – and the quicker the better.”By modern standards, Goldfinger wasn’t doing anything wrong, apart perhaps from dodging some taxes. He was buying up gold at a price people were prepared to pay for it, then selling it in another market, where people were prepared to pay more. It was his money. It was his gold. So what was the problem? He was oiling the wheels of commerce, efficiently allocating capital where it could best be used, no?No, because that wasn’t how Bretton Woods worked. Colonel Smithers considered the gold to belong not only to Goldfinger, but also to Great Britain. The system didn’t consider the owner of money to be the only person with a say in what happened to it. According to the carefully crafted rules, the nations that created and guaranteed the value of money had rights to that money, too. They restricted the rights of money-owners in the interests of everybody else. At Bretton Woods, the allies – desperate to avoid a repeat of the horrors of the inter-war depression and the second world war – decided that, when it came to international trade, society’s rights trumped those of money-owners.All this is hard to imagine for anyone who has only experienced the world since the 1980s, because the system now is so different. Money flows ceaselessly between countries, nosing out investment opportunities in China, Brazil, Russia or wherever. If a currency is overvalued, investors sense the weakness and gang up on it like sharks around a sickly whale. In times of global crisis, the money retreats into the safety of gold or US government bonds. In boom times, it pumps up share prices elsewhere in its restless quest for a good return. These waves of liquid capital have such power that they can wash away all but the strongest governments. The prolonged speculative attacks on the euro, the rouble or the pound, which have been such a feature of the past few decades, would have been impossible under the Bretton Woods system, which was specifically designed to stop them happening.One reason Baring hated the restrictions was that they were killing the City of London. “It was like driving a powerful car at 20 miles an hour,” lamented one banker, of his spell in charge of a major British bank. “The banks were anaesthetised. It was a kind of dream life.” In those days, bankers arrived at work late, left early and frittered away much of the time in between having boozy lunches. No one particularly cared, because there wasn’t much to do anyway.Today, looking over its glass-and-steel skyline, it is hard to imagine that the City of London once almost died as a financial centre. In the 1950s and 1960s, the City played little part in the national conversation. Yet, although few books about the swinging 60s even mention the City, something very significant was brewing there – something that would change the world far more than the Beatles or Mary Quant or David Hockney ever did, something that would shatter the high-minded strictures of the Bretton Woods system.By the time Ian Fleming published Goldfinger in 1959, there were already some leaks in the compartments of the oil tanker. The problem was that not all foreign governments trusted the US to honour its commitment to use the dollar as an impartial international currency and they were not unreasonable in doing so, since Washington did not always act as a fair umpire. In the immediate post-second-world-war years, the US government had sequestered communist Yugoslavia’s gold reserves. The rattled eastern bloc countries then made a habit of keeping their dollars in European banks rather than in New York.Similarly, when Britain and France attempted to regain control of the Suez canal in 1956, a disapproving Washington froze their access to dollars and doomed the venture. These were not the actions of a neutral arbiter. Britain at the time was staggering from one crisis to another. In 1957, it raised interest rates and stopped banks using sterling to finance trade in an attempt to keep the pound strong (this was the “currency crisis and the high bank rate” that Smithers told Bond about).City banks, which could no longer use sterling in the way they were accustomed, began to use dollars instead, and they obtained those dollars from the Soviet Union, which was keeping them in London and Paris so as to avoid becoming vulnerable to American pressure. This turned out to be a profitable thing to do. In the US, there were limits on how much interest banks could charge on dollar loans – but not so in London.This market – the bankers called the dollars “eurodollars” – gave a bit of life to the City of London in the late 1950s, but not much. The big bond issues were still taking place in New York, a fact which annoyed many bankers in London. After all, many of the companies borrowing the money were European, yet it was American banks that were earning the fat commissions.One banker in particular was not prepared to tolerate this: Siegmund Warburg. Warburg was an outsider in the cosy world of the City. For one thing, he was German. For another, he hadn’t given up on the idea that a City banker’s job was to hustle for business. In 1962, Warburg learned from a friend at the World Bank that some $3bn was circulating outside the US – sloshing around and ready to be put to use. Warburg had been a banker in Germany in the 1920s and remembered arranging bond deals in foreign currencies. Why couldn’t his bankers do something similar again?For the City’s most ambitious financiers, this was tantalising: there was all this money squirrelled away, doing nothing much, and it was exactly what they needed in their quest to start selling bonds again. As Warburg saw it, if he could somehow access the money, package it up and lend it, he would be in business. Surely, Warburg thought, he could persuade the people who were paying Swiss bankers to look after their money that they would rather earn an income from it by buying his bonds? And surely he could persuade European companies that they would rather borrow this money from him and avoid paying the steep fees demanded in New York?It was a great idea, but there was a problem: the compartments of the oil tanker were in the way. It was impossible for Warburg to move that money from Switzerland via London to clients who wanted to borrow it. But he took two of his best men and told them to get it done anyway.They began their efforts in October 1962, the same month that the Beatles released Love Me Do. The bankers finalised their deal on 1 July the following year, the same day that the Fab Four recorded She Loves You, the song that sparked global Beatlemania. That extraordinary nine months not only revolutionised pop music, but also geopolitics, since they included the Cuban missile crisis and John F Kennedy’s Ich bin ein Berliner speech. Under the circumstances, it is understandable that a simultaneous revolution in global finance passed little remarked.Warburg’s new bond issue – these bonds became known as “eurobonds”, after the example set by eurodollars – was led by Ian Fraser, a Scottish war hero turned journalist turned banker. He and his colleague Peter Spira had to find ways to defang the taxes and controls designed to prevent hot money flowing across borders, and to find ways to pick and choose different aspects of different countries’ regulations for the various elements of their creation.The cumulative effect of this game of jurisdictional Twister was that Fraser created a bond paying a good rate of interest, on which no one had to pay tax of any kind, and which could be turned back into cash anywhere. These were what are known as bearer bonds. Whoever possessed the bond owned them there was no register of ownership or any obligation to record your holding, which was not written down anywhere.Fraser’s eurobonds were like magic. Before eurobonds, hidden wealth in Switzerland couldn’t really do much but now it could buy these fantastic pieces of paper, which could be carried anywhere, redeemed anywhere and all the while paid interest to their owners, tax free. Dodge taxes and make a profit, worldwide.So, who was buying Fraser’s magical invention? Who was providing the money he was lending to IRI, via Autostrade? “The main buyers of these bonds were iniduals, usually from eastern Europe but often also from Latin America, who wanted to have part of their fortune in mobile form so that if they had to leave they could leave quickly with their bonds in a small suitcase,” Fraser wrote in his autobiography. “There was still a mass migration of the surviving Jewish populations of central Europe heading for Israel and the west. To this was added the normal migration of fallen South American dictators heading east. Switzerland was where all this money was stashed away.”Later, historians tried to downplay Fraser’s account a little, and to claim that corrupt politicians – those fallen South American dictators – made up just a fifth or so of the demand for these early bond issues. As for the remaining four-fifths of the money that bought up the bonds, this came from standard tax dodgers – “Belgian dentists”, the bankers called them – high-earning professionals who steered a chunk of their earnings to Luxembourg or Geneva, and who welcomed this lovely new investment.The eurobonds set wealth free and were the first step towards creating the virtual country of the rich that I call Moneyland. Moneyland includes offshore finance, but is much broader than that, since it protects every aspect of a rich person’s life from scrutiny, not just their money. The same money-making dynamic that enticed Fraser to defang capital controls on behalf of his clients, entices his modern-day counterparts to find ways for the world’s richest people to avoid visa controls, journalistic scrutiny, legal liability and much more. Moneyland is a place where, if you are rich enough, whoever you are, wherever your money comes from, the laws do not apply to you.This is the dirty secret at the heart of the City’s rebirth, the beginning of the process that eventually led to today’s stratospheric inequality. It was all made possible by modern communications – the telegram, the phone, the telex, the fax, the email – and it allowed the world’s richest people to avoid the responsibilities of citizenshipThat first deal was for $15m. But once the way to sidestep the obstacles that stopped cash flowing offshore had been identified, there was nothing to stop more money following behind. In the second half of 1963, $35m of eurobonds were sold. In 1964, the market was $510m. In 1967, the total passed $1bn for the first time, and it is now one of the biggest markets in the world.The result was that, over time, the system created at Bretton Woods fell apart. More and more dollars were escaping offshore, where they avoided the regulations and taxes imposed upon them by the US government. But they were still dollars, and thus 35 of them were still worth an ounce of gold.The trouble that followed stemmed from the fact that dollars don’t just sit around doing nothing. They multiply. If you put a dollar in a bank, the bank uses it as security for the money it lends to someone else, meaning there are more dollars – your dollar, and the dollars someone else has borrowed. And if that person puts the money in another bank, and that bank lends it, there are now even more dollars, and so on.And since every one of those dollars was nominally worth a fixed amount of gold, the US would have needed to keep buying ever more gold to satisfy the potential demand. If the US did that, however, it would have to have bought that gold with dollars, meaning yet more dollars would exist, which would multiply in turn, meaning more gold purchases, and more dollars, until the system would eventually collapse under the weight of the fact that it didn’t make sense it couldn’t cope with offshore.The US government tried to defend the dollargold price, but every restriction it put on dollar movements just made it more profitable to keep your dollars in London, leading more money to leak offshore, and thus more pressure to build on the dollargold price. And where the dollars went, the bankers followed. The City had looser regulations and more accommodating politicians than Wall Street, and the banks loved it. In 1964, 11 US banks had branches in the City of London. In 1975, 58 did.The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who administered the federal banking system, opened a permanent office in London to inspect what the British branches of American banks were up to. But the Americans had no power in the UK and got no help from the locals. “It doesn’t matter to me,” said Jim Keogh, the Bank of England official responsible for monitoring these banks, “whether Citibank is evading American regulations in London”.By that time, however, Washington had bowed to the inevitable and stopped promising to redeem dollars for gold at $35 an ounce. It was the first step in a steady dismantling of all the safeguards created at Bretton Woods. The philosophical question over who really owned money – the person who earned it, or the country that created it – had been answered.If you had money, thanks to the accommodating bankers of London and Switzerland, you could now do what you wanted with it and governments could not stop you. As long as one country tolerated offshore, as Britain did, then the efforts of all the others came to nothing. If regulations stop at a country’s borders, but the money can flow wherever it wishes, its owners can outwit any regulators they choose.The developments that began with Warburg did not stop with simple eurobonds. The basic pattern was endlessly replicable. Identify a line of business that might make you and your clients money. Look around the world for a jurisdiction with the right rules for that business – Liechtenstein, the Cook Islands, Jersey – and use it as a nominal base.If you couldn’t find a jurisdiction with the right kind of rules, then you threatened or flattered one until it changed its rules to accommodate you. Warburg himself started this off, by explaining to the Bank of England that if Britain did not make its rules competitive and its taxes lower, then he would take his bank elsewhere, perhaps to Luxembourg.Hey presto, the rules were changed, and the tax – in this case, stamp duty on bearer bonds – was abolished. The world’s response to these developments has been entirely predictable as well. Time after time, countries have chased after the business they have lost offshore (as the US did by abolishing the regulations the banks were dodging when they moved to London), thus making the onshore world ever more similar to the offshore piratical world that Warburg’s bankers created.Taxes have fallen, regulations have relaxed, politicians have become friendlier, all in an effort to entice the restless money to settle in one jurisdiction rather than another. The reason for this is simple. Once one jurisdiction lets you do what you want, the business flows there and other jurisdictions have to rush to change, too. It is the Moneyland ratchet, always loosening regulations for the benefit of those with money to move around, and never tightening them.“It’s very easy for oligarchs of developing countries, non-democratic countries, to hide their wealth. That provides them with huge incentives to loot their countries, and there’s no oversight,” says Zucman.Come January, we will get another update of how much more of the world’s wealth these oligarchs have taken for themselves: the only surprise will be the precise volume of their new acquisition, and how little they have left for the rest of us. But we shouldn’t wait until then to grasp the urgency of the situation.We need to act now to shine a light on their wealth, on the dark matter whose gravitational power is bending the fabric of our societies. We may have been ignoring Moneyland, but its nomad citizens have not been ignoring us. If we wish to take back control of our economies, and our democracies, we need to act now. Every day that we wait, more money is stacked against us.Adapted from Moneyland: Why Thieves \u0026amp Crooks Now Rule The World \u0026amp How to Take It Back by Oliver Bullough, published by Profile Books• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a9ca05fbccdf560f6c14a9de547581906915ac/0_447_1904_1142/master/1904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589f67786ee67495c3865af45d8b0f98","title":"john mcdonnell seeks to banish labour woes with speaking tour","story":"Shadow chancellor hopes to shift agenda to Tory cuts and away from antisemitism row John McDonnell will this weekend seek to draw a line under the bitter infighting that has gripped his party over the summer by kicking off an anti-austerity speaking tour in Conservative MP Anna Soubry’s Nottinghamshire constituency of Broxtowe.The shadow chancellor, whose profile has increased significantly in recent months, plans to visit a constituency every few weeks until the next general election on what he is calling the “road to rebuilding the economy tour”.Labour has struggled to get its message across in recent weeks, during the ongoing row over antisemitism, but McDonnell hopes to wrest the agenda back to the safer territory of rejecting Tory spending cuts.“In Broxtowe and across the length and breadth of Britain, Labour will set out its plans to revive the economy and create jobs,” McDonnell said. Soubry, who has been critical of the prime minister’s Brexit stance, held Broxtowe with a majority of just 863 at last year’s general election.As McDonnell’s nationwide tour begins, however, there is little sign of the two sides in Labour’s civil war being reconciled.Chuka Umunna, the Streatham MP who was recently forced to deny that he was planning to leave Labour and set up a rival party, will give a speech in London on Saturday, urging the leadership to “call off the dogs” from MPs critical of Jeremy Corbyn, several of whom are facing motions of no confidence from their local parties.He will say: “Having only been re-elected by their constituents last year, already centre-left MPs are being targeted systematically with motions against them for standing up for these values – for demanding we have a zero tolerance of racism in our party. More motions such as this are expected by colleagues.“My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this, so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most erse communities in the nation, demands we do without equivocation: fight this Tory Brexit. That is where all our efforts should be.”Labour activists called for a party inquiry on Friday after an Iranian state-backed broadcaster streamed footage of the Enfield North MP, Joan Ryan, losing a confidence vote.The Press TV footage, which appeared to have been filmed inside the meeting, was carried on the station’s Twitter feed and referred to Ryan, who chairs Labour Friends of Israel, as a “pro-Israel MP”. It included the hashtag #WeAreEnfieldNorth.The local party chairman, Siddo Dwyer, said that filming was not allowed in the room and he would be making a formal complaint to the channel. “Warnings were issued about filming, including a direct warning to the member in question,” he wrote on Twitter. “It didn’t occur to any of us at the time that they were from a state broadcaster.”But Roshan Salih, a journalist at Press TV, disputed that account. He told the : “No general warnings issued, no posters, no approach to person we obtained footage from.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Filming of local Labour party meetings is not permitted and Enfield North will be reminded of this fact.”Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the filming made a farce of the proceedings and “is not how the modern Labour party should conduct its affairs”.Ryan was critical of Corbyn over his stance on antisemitismduring the row that has preoccupied the party for much of the summer.The no-confidence motion, which is not binding, accused Ryan of “smearing” the Labour leader’s character, “without him having the right to a fair and balanced defence”.Another MP critical of Corbyn’s leadership, Gavin Shuker, who represents Luton South, was also the subject of a vote of no confidence from his constituency party on Thursday night, but he said he would continue to serve his constituents.Labour’s unrest was further inflamed on Friday by remarks from the former prime minister Tony Blair, who said the party had “profoundly changed” under Corbyn’s leadership.“It is a different type of Labour party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know,” he said on the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast.The Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, a member of Labour’s national executive committee and staunch backer of Corbyn, shot back that Blair was “never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in Labour”.Momentum is keen for grassroots party members to play more of a role in selecting and removing Labour’s candidates for parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cba4b5fa59fe43c58d85529839ecbbcb714a420/0_269_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1bbd65e4be2c2be4906966ec31cdf2f","title":"you can have a voice political festivals on rise uk","story":"Return of Tory-led Big Tent Ideas festival is part of a growing trend so far dominated by the leftIt was mercilessly lampooned last summer as the “Tory Glastonbury” – a paddock of largely male Conservative supporters in red chinos who could only dream of aping the adulation Jeremy Corbyn received from young fans at the music festival months earlier.The vision behind the Big Tent Ideas festival, brainchild of the Tory MP George Freeman, was to to connect the party with young people and build a centre-right movement to propel it forward. One year on, however, the festival has returned with a new strategy.“It’s totally different.

An event that is, when all is said and done, an attempt at detoxification and brand revival of the Tory party, particularly with young people.”Saturday’s gatherings inside eight tents at Babraham Research Campus in Cambridge, with speakers on topics ranging from “Tax and State” to “Millennials – Maybe They Are More Libertarian Than We Think?”, reflect a growing appetite for “political festivalism”.The trend has largely been powered by the left, and has been mocked in some quarters as a “Jezfest”. In June, despite a slow start on ticket sales, Labour Live attracted 13,000 people to a park in north London to hear Corbyn give a speech on policy and listen to musical acts including the Magic Numbers.There have also been regional spin-offs of the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group’s The World Transformed (TWT), a parallel event to Labour’s annual conference that has become popular with many young, and not so young, leftwingers. Derby, Southwark in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Durham have all hosted TWT-style political events over the past year.A desire to meet in person to engage in political discussion rather than in social media echo chambers might be one reason for the popularity of such events. The writer Maya Goodfellow, a Labour supporter, said it also derived from a notion that politics and culture should not be separate.Goodfellow said of her experience as a speaker at Labour Live: “The thing I really enjoyed was that people came up to me afterwards and wanted to continue with the discussion after the event had officially ended, and we were able to do that.“These sort of events have always been around – take Rock Against Racism – but I would argue that they’re also related to the fallout from the financial crash and the idea that they are a product of people being told ‘you can have a voice’.”Away from party politics, other recent events seen as part of the trend include the Byline festival in East Sussex, billed as promoting independent journalism and free speech, which took place for a second year this summer.Meanwhile, “festivals of ideas” have become part of the university landscape. Joan Concannon, the director of one such festival in York – styled as a partnership between the university and cultural, social and business organisations in the city, said its aim was to demonstrate that the institution was “not an ivory tower” and break down barriers with other communities.“We find that people are very engaged – particularly when we have done things around, for example, the refugee crisis,” she said.“People are genuinely concerned and, personally, I think that they like engaging more directly with speakers because they often just don’t feel they are listened to by political decision makers.”Freeman said events like the Big Tent Ideas festival were important because “for a generation under 40 the traditional party conference is as dead as a dodo”.“Travelling and spending days in a remote city under high security in a corporate setting is just not attractive to them,” he said.“Secondly, I think that Brexit has created a huge frustration for young people and there is a demand for discussion about ideas. I have always insisted that there is a cultural element to politics. The left has actually been a bit better at recognising that but we are changing that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ccf1943b5b7344bb826edcfdd3579f","title":"feline hungry an expert guide to feeding cats","story":"Your cat may act like it can look after itself but, like a teenager, it’s definitely underselling how much it needs you – especially when it comes to nutrition. Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

Nishikori had to save four break points before dropping his serve at the first time of asking. He gave what he had but Djokovic was pulling away at the end, winning 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. It took him two hours and 23 minutes – only 22 minutes longer than Nadal kept Del Potro interested, before an emotional withdrawal in the first semi-final.“I came out of the blocks with great intensity and focus,” Djokovic said immediately afterwards.A couple of times during the heatwave that gripped this tournament in the first 10 days or so, he has looked to be suffering badly. But in the cooler conditions at the end, he has prospered again.Djokovic has now beaten the gifted but physically fragile Japanese player 14 times in a row since losing to him in the semi-finals here in 2014, when Nishikori went on to lose to Marin Cilic in the final. Nishikori beat the Croatian in their rematch in the quarter-finals this time.Djokovic’s most recent win over Nishikori was in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon this summer, on his way to winning the title.It took Nishikori more than a quarter of an hour to get on the board on Friday, but, on a night when injury was the talking point, he pulled up dramatically mid-point in the ninth game, grabbing at his right leg, before holding to keep the set alive at 3-5. If there was a trophy for injuries, Nishikori and Nadal would probably make the final every time.Djokovic looked well in command taking the first set before they then settled down to a string of close rallies until he broke again in the fifth game of the second, serving out the frame. Yet this was Nishikori’s best stretch: winning the point on 14 of 15 visits to the net and hitting 12 clean winners. It still wasn’t enough, and Djokovic finished it style, hitting a remarkable backhand winner into the corner from well out of court.If Djokovic beats Del Potro to win his 14th slam, he moves alongside Sampras and will sit three behind Nadal and six behind Federer. After losing the first three matches of his comeback this year, he has gone on to reach the quarter-finals at Roland Garros, lose to Nadal in the semi-finals in Rome and in the Queen’s final to Cilic, before beating Kevin Anderson in the Wimbledon final.He has resurrected his career impressively after minor surgery on his long-term elbow injury, which kept him out of the game for six months last year. This is not vintage Djokovic just yet, but he is still good enough to win at the highest level."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53988578cd96b5c0dfc906a5221c43055f334f40/0_109_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7964c8ff943fd4432331fdb11c471d","title":"wallabies edge hard fought springboks rugby championship clash","story":"They were more lucky than good but the Wallabies were delighted to lift the gloom permeating Australian rugby as they edged the Springboks 23-18 at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.The Springboks dominated the first half, only for a freakish Matt Toomua try to keep them within touching distance at the interval, before desperate defence saw them hold out in the closing stages in front of a disappointing crowd of 27,849.It appeared a third consecutive tie between the sides could be on the cards when Francois Louw was awarded a try with two minutes on the clock but the TMO adjudged a double knock-on from Kurtley Beale and Malcolm Marx in the lead up to the try.Ultimately, two second-half penalties from man-of-the match Toomua, after flying back for a final game for the Leicester Tigers last week, decided the game in the Wallabies’ favour.As is so often the case for the Wallabies, the key antidote to ending doom and gloom was to play anyone but the All Blacks.After back-to-back humblings and a horror 24 hours before the game, where key trio David Pocock, Israel Folau and Adam Coleman were ruled out, Michael Cheika’s side had enough excuses not to deliver against the Springboks but they showed real resilience to edge home.The Wallabies’ fortunes improved immediately from the first whistle and Michael Hooper opened the scoring in the second minute.\u0026nbspKurtley Beale, moved into fly-half at the expense of Bernard Foley, sparked immediately breaking the line and feeding Lukhan Tui to race down the left touchline to put them within touching distance of the try-line and eleven phases later the skipper ed over for his 16th Test try.After the try, the Springboks dominated the next 15 minutes. Their tactic was clear, to utilise Bongi Mbonambi’s pinpoint line out delivery to set up mauls which Australia struggled to contain. From this tactic Mbonambi eased over to score the Springboks’ first try.Australia’s line-out woes again haunted them when Genia could not take a feed back cleanly and was tackled in the in-goal area.Soon afterwards, a smart pass wide from Faf de Klerk to Makazole Mapimpi saw him e over for a try to extend the lead.What the line-out gods took they gaveth back when Mbonambi’s errant throw cleared his Springbok jumpers, and skidded across the field in front of the posts where Toomua ed on the ball and glided over the try-line.Despite a massive disparity in possession and territory statistics, a massive 53-yard metre penalty from ‘super-boot’ Reece Hodge brought the Wallabies within a point at half time.The Wallabies came out for the second half the sharper and a moment of inspiration from Will Genia running down the left touchline almost resulted in a try after which the Wallabies camped in the Springboks’ 22.Some desperate tackling plus Rob Simmons dropped a ball with the try-line gaping and Marika Koroibete’s ill-judged attempted off-load saw them hold on to their narrow advantage.\u0026nbspToomua’s two kicks was the only second half change to the scoreboard with South Africa left to rue handling errors - Willie le Roux the key culprit with three knock ons - as the Wallabies prevailed in an increasingly feisty encounter to keep hold of the Nelson Mandela Plate.The Wallabies next face Argentina while the Springboks face a trip across the Tasman to face the All Blacks.An experimental New Zealand team was forced to dig deep on Saturday to beat underdogs Argentina 46-24 at Trafalgar Park in Nelson.Argentina have not beaten New Zealand in 26 previous Tests but, boosted by their recent win over South Africa, they scored the first try in each half to keep the All Blacks under constant pressure.New Zealand held an unconvincing 18-14 lead after 50 minutes but a try-scoring double by scrum-half TJ Perenara, and tries from returning winger Nehe Milner-Skudder, captain Kieran Read, Shannon Frizell and Jack Goodhue allowed the All Blacks to escape and retain their unbeaten record in this year’s Championship.The ball-carrying by Frizell and other forwards such as Scott Barrett and Codie Taylor was the best part of an otherwise disjointed All Black performance. For the Pumas, Ramiro Moyano scored the early try, while fly-half Nicolás Sánchez scored a try, penalty and three conversions to overtake Felipe Contepomi as Argentina’s leading scorer for Argentina in Tests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f5c67a1a2ba025a64360ba3d914b1b7d238e73c/0_248_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01364e8e1fb81ba8bb5868707c4cf427","title":"nfl stadium food 2018","story":"With the National Football League season kicking off this week, here’s a sampling of what the fans will be eating in the stands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e88068fead1323e48466627d492aa667e7e925c/0_26_3711_2226/master/3711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=720068b8767ce259ff32ed5981519081","title":"england v india fifth test day two live","story":"2nd over: India 6-1 (Rahul 3, Pujara 0) Dhawan would have been out even if he had been able to review, as the point of contact with the pad was umpire’s call. Broad starts with a wicket maiden. After a difficult 2017, he is quietly having an excellent year. Stuart Broad strikes with his first ball! Dhawan played defensively outside the line of a delivery that angled in to hit the pad. I thought he might have been outside the line of off stump as well. Dhawan wanted to review it but was told by the umpires he had taken too long.1st over: India 6-0 (Rahul 3, Dhawan 3) KL Rahul drives Jimmy Anderson’s first ball confidently for three, and then Dhawan gets off the mark with a nice cut stroke for two. A quiet first over from Anderson. The ball didn’t swing for India until it was 20-30 overs old yesterday, so England may have to be patient.“Has Jimmy been not out more often than any other batsman in Test history?” asks Peter Hulme. “If so, it would be a batting award to set alongside his many bowling ones, and maybe we could call him an all-rounder?”He certainly has. It’s interesting to note the proper batsmen who are high on that list.There will be no birthday century for Buttler. He falls 11 short, edging Jadeja to Rahane at slip, but walks off to a standing ovation for another fine innings: 89 from 133 balls with six fours and two sixes. It took a while for him to work it all out, but he’s a fully fledged Test batsman now.121st over: England 330-9 (Buttler 87, Anderson 0) Breaking news: Jos Buttler is batting. No no no, Jos Buttler is batting. He has just smashed Bumrah for two sixes in three balls, with a mighty swipe to cow corner followed by a top-edged hook that was pure Botham ’81. 120th over: England 317-9 (Buttler 74, Anderson 0) This time Buttler takes a single off the fifth ball of Jadeja’s over, and Anderson survives the last delivery This could get very repetitive.119th over: England 316-9 (Buttler 73, Anderson 0) Buttler doesn’t seem too fussed about farming the strike. He takes a single off Bumrah’s third ball, and Anderson survives the rest of the over.Incidentally, that catch by KL Rahul was his 13th of the series, equalling the Indian record for an outfielder in a Test series.118th over: England 313-9 (Buttler 70, Anderson 0) Earlier in the over Buttler scored his 1000th run in international cricket this year, which is more than anyone else in the world.Broad’s perky innings is ended by a spectacular catch from KL Rahul. He lofted Jadeja high towards mid-on, where Rahul ran back towards the boundary and swooped to take a superb two-handed catch.117th over: England 311-8 (Buttler 68, Broad 38) Broad edges Bumrah just short of second slip. “Jagged Ultra Edge,” says Dan Woodward, continuing the theme of cricket film titles. “Allan Donald travels back in time to Trent Bridge 1998 and calls for a review.”116th over: England 308-8 (Buttler 66, Broad 37) Ravindra Jadeja returns to the attack after lunch. Buttler adds three to his score, which takes him to within 34 of an unlikely hundred.“Valid point made previously about Bairstow’s contribution to reviews,” says Ian T. “Under Cook we were excellent with using them (if I’m being harsh it was probably his best captaincy trait) - Root and Bairstow seem intent on wasting them by over 10. We need to review the reviewers.”It’s become an important skill, hasn’t it? Matt Prior was extremely good. Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler seem much calmer in the limited-overs teams. That’s right, I said limited-overs teams. I’m waging war on contemporary white-ball phrases. 115th over: England 304-8 (Buttler 63, Broad 36) Buttler, on the walk, survives a deceptively close LBW appeal from Shami. That’s the end of a quietly surreal morning session in which England, who resumed on 198 for seven, unexpectedly made it past 200. Jos Buttler continued his excellent summer and Stuart Broad played a jaunty supporting innings.India were a bit flat in the field, though their bowlers still beat the outside edge on numerous occasions. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.114th over: England 300-8 (Buttler 62, Broad 33) Broad scoots back for a second run to bring up England’s 300. I’m not quite sure how this has happened, given they were 181 for seven at one stage.113th over: England 298-8 (Buttler 62, Broad 32) Broad plays and misses at Shami. So does Buttler. I reckon Shami has beaten the outside edge 30 or 40 times in this innings without finding the edge. It’s remarkable, and that’s why I’ve just remarked upon it.“Robbiest,” says Mac Millings. “I dont have any cricket-themed films for you, but I do know that Public Enemy’s debut album, ‘Yo! Bumrah the Show’, after an awkward opening, suddenly clicks, and blows the opposition away. Their follow-up, ‘It Takes a Nation of Kane Williamsons to Hold Us Back’, is a still-underrated gem, but my personal favourite has to be ‘Fear of an Inzamam-ul-Haq Planet’ - although superstitious fans of English cricket should avoid Track Three, ‘111 Is No Joke’.” 112th over: England 296-8 (Buttler 61, Broad 31) Buttler survives a desperate LBW appeal after being pinned by a big inswinger from Sharma. I think it swung too much, not that India have any reviews remaining. Hawkeye confirms it was missing leg stump. Broad compounds India’s frustration by slicing a filthy yahoo over the slips for four.“Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Aggrieved as I am that the OBO has still not picked up the option on my epic Citizen Cook film, I must confess that Kim Thonger’s Eternal Sunshine pitch had me chuckling appreciatively. Looking at screenwriter Charlie Kaufman’s other credits prompts the idea of ‘Being John Edrich’, a surreal investigation into the inner workings of a gritty 1960s opening batsman. However, I refuse to give up on Citizen Cook even if I am forced to tout it elsewhere.”Oh go on then. “Film pitch for Citizen Cook - a sweeping epic that retraces the life story of England’s greatest hoarder in a forlorn attempt to interpret his parting word at the crease, via a series of flashbacks tracing his fabled career. No-one can fathom the mystery until the final scene in the Lord’s Long Room during the end of season clear out of lost property and discarded kit. The astute viewer realises that his parting word is in fact the name scratched on the back of his first schoolboy cricket bat, just as the final credits roll over the flaming embers of the precious childhood willow being consumed in the Long Room fireplace ... ‘Bugger’.”111th over: England 289-8 (Buttler 60, Broad 26) “I think the management need to do a lot of work with Bairstow before the winter,” says Adrian Armstrong. “Too many of his recent decisions seem to be motivated by adolescent FOMO and do the team no favours at all. Declining a nightwatchman at the SCG, treating the keeper’s role in a way that makes Neymar look like a model of mature humility, insisting he’s fit to play despite finger-knack ... does anyone in the Test setup ever contest what anyone else thinks? I’d also be interested to know about his input as keeper into the reviews that England request when fielding, with mostly dismal consequences.”It’s all very odd, this Bairstow business. I do have some sympathy for him, and I wonder how much of this is a figment of the media’s imagination. Dropping him would have been unthinkable a month ago, but now I wouldn’t be surprised if he was left out at some stage during the winter. 110th over: England 286-8 (Buttler 57, Broad 26) Buttler thumps Sharma through extra cover for four, a cracking stroke. He might even be thinking of another Test hundred, which is absurd given he was 11 not out overnight with only Nos 9-11 remaining. India, for reasons I can’t quite fathom, have let the tortoise get away from them. This is a good spot from Tim de Lisle. “Buttler scratched his way to 15 off 48 balls – one of the joys of watching him this summer has been the way he can suddenly change the tempo.”109th over: England 278-8 (Buttler 52, Broad 23) Buttler, on the drive, snicks a Shami outswinger through the vacant third slip area for four. Virat Kohli is about to misplace his rag. A force through extra cover for two takes Buttler to an excellent half-century from 84 balls. Happy birthday.“Please say very bad things about both these batsmen in the interests of assuring their longevity,” says Ian Copestake. “Options include ‘walking wicket,’ ‘very uncomfortable’ and ‘a lanky streak of ...’”108th over: England 270-8 (Buttler 45, Broad 22) Ishant Sharma returns to the attack after a shoddy little spell from Jadeja. Buttler flicks him behind square for four to bring up a breezy - and surprisingly easy - fifty partnership from only 61 balls.“The Eternal Sunshine Of the HotSpotless Mind,” says Kim Thonger. “In a world where umpiring technology has been abolished, a team of zombified casual touring cricketers called The Snickers, go on the rampage, leaving a trail of destruction and broken cricket bats all over St. John’s Wood. Starring Shane Warne and Elizabeth Hurley.”107th over: England 263-8 (Buttler 39, Broad 21) The luckless Shami beats Broad with consecutive deliveries Broad responds with a stylish clip through mid-on for four. Shot!“Racking my brains but I can’t think of apartments, sumptuous or otherwise, which overlook Galle cricket ground, which anyway is in the middle of a roundabout,” writes our old friend Mike Selvey. “Are you sure your correspondent hasn’t been sold a pup?”All they needed were his bank details…106th over: England 258-8 (Buttler 38, Broad 17) India have been strangely passive in the last 20 minutes, and even Broad doesn’t look in danger of getting out. “Ben Parker is absolutely right,” says Matt Dony. “I’ve just sat down Master Dony and had a word. ‘I know you’re only 6, but it’s only one whole kilometre(!). Get over yourself and give up the Iron nonsense.’ I mean, the tears will pass. He’ll thank me in the long run...”Hardship begets hardness. I’d make the little git walk home. 105th over: England 253-8 (Buttler 34, Broad 16) “Interested in your take on Buttler’s series Rob,” says Phil Harrison. “I’m biased because I’m a fool for the lad. But to me, he’s starting to look a seasoned and mature Test batsman, capable of assessing the conditions and match situation and playing accordingly. He might be a better bet at five than either Bairstow or Stokes.”Yes, his selection has been an unmitigated triumph. He’s a very smart batsman and reads the game superbly, as you say. I would have him no higher than No6 and ideally at No7, mainly because he can be so devastating with the tail. I have no problem with a specialist batsman at No7, but there is certainly a case for having him above Bairstow. 104th over: England 251-8 (Buttler 33, Broad 15) Ravindra Jadeja comes into the attack and is slapped for four by Buttler. He now averages over 50 in Tests this summer none of the other regular top-order batsmen are averaging even 30.103rd over: England 243-8 (Buttler 28, Broad 12) After the obligatory play and miss at Shami, Buttler works the ball through midwicket for two. That’s drinks.“Harold \u0026amp Kumar Get the Ronchis,” offers Harry McNeill Adams. “A buddytime-travel movie in which Harold Larwood and Kumar Sangakkara try to persuade Luke Ronchi to sign for a newly formed IPL franchise.”102nd over: England 24o-8 (Buttler 25, Broad 12) A Bumrah bouncer gets big on Pant, - never mind the batsman Broad - and he strains every sinew to save four byes. England are inching towards their ‘it’ll do’ target of 250.“Rob, what were you thinking?” says Anna Halford. “You know better than to make comments about who’s playing ‘particularly’ well! Sigh.” If OBO jinxing really did count, I’d have almost as many Test wickets than Jimmy Anderson. 101st over: England 237-8 (Buttler 23, Broad 11) Mohammed Shami comes into the attack and beats both Buttler and Broad outside off stump. Shami is on course for one of Test cricket’s great nought-fors. Any other contenders? I thought Flintoff bowled beautifully at Chandigarh in 2001, the first real sign of the magnificent bowler he would become.“Don’t know if anyone’s mentioned it previously but I found out yesterday that Alan Oakman passed away this week,” says Mike Daniels. “I believe he was the last surviving cricketer who played in Laker’s Test in 1956. A legend at Warwickshire, many will mourn him and remember him for his sage advice and wicked humour as coach to the club and more recently to the over-50s side. Countless cricketers will remember him fondly.”That passed me by. Very sad news. Didn’t he take five or six catches in Laker’s match?100th over: England 234-8 (Buttler 21, Broad 10) An errant full toss from Bumrah flies for four byes. The next delivery is a beauty, a short ball that rams into Broad’s armpit as he turns his head away. “I had to look up the Ironkids event,” says Ben Parker. “Here it is. They are only doing a short run of less than a mile. Hardly warrants the grandiose title ‘Ironkids’.” I’d love to hear Royal Tenenbaum’s take on Ironkids.99th over: England 228-8 (Buttler 21, Broad 8) Broad laces Sharma over extra cover for four. We know all about his decline as a batsman but he’s still a pesky tailend slogger. Since eating that bouncer from Varun Aaron in 2014, Broad averages 13.67 - not great but not entirely without use.“If you could look out of the windows of a sumptuous apartment and watch any player past or present, who would it be?” says James Debens. “I’d love to observe the nagging waddle of Fast Eddie Hemmings in the round.”98th over: England 221-8 (Buttler 20, Broad 2) Buttler snicks Bumrah for four, with the ball landing just short of Kohli at second slip.“Feel free to roundly mock me from the safety of your laptop but is there a good reason not to try Ben Stokes opening?” says George Humphreys. “Old Stokes would obviously be ridiculous but post-Bristol Brouhaha Stokes seems far more watchful and happy to leave the ball. He’s got the courage for it and is surely better suited than Bairstow who was loudly trumpeted earlier in the summer. Would necessitate his bowling workload being managed but that could also be an advantage as he could be purely a strike bowler. How about it, eh?!”I don’t think any of those allrounders should bat higher than No5 – they are all too attacking andor hard-handed to regularly face the new ball. I agree with Michael Vaughan: England should forget fancy solutions and concentrate on finding a top four who do nothing other than bat. The allrounders can then squabble over the remaining positions (and give England serious batting depth). England have too many bowlers at the moment.As I said, Rashid is playing particularly well. He’s gone for 15, trapped in front by a sharp nipbacker from Bumrah. Rashid reviewed, because he’s worth it, but replays showed it was shaving the leg stump and that was enough for the original decision to stand.97th over: England 214-7 (Buttler 15, Rashid 15) The ball is swinging prodigiously but Buttler and particularly Rashid are playing well. Here’s Gary Naylor. “If Leo (93rd over) is expecting sympathy for having to watch a Test match in Galle without seeing Alastair Cook - well I’m giving precisely zero tuk-tuks.” 96th over: England 212-7 (Buttler 15, Rashid 14) Rashid plays a gorgeous stroke, flipping Bumrah wristily through midwicket for four. He’s a very good Test No9 and should probably be averaging a bit more than 19.“Dude, Where’s McGrath?’ says Luke Devereux, returning to cricket film titles. “Two young Australian cricket fans turn up to the second Ashes test in 2005 only to find that their favourite player has been ruled out by a freak injury.” 95th over: England 207-7 (Buttler 14, Rashid 10) Buttler goes into one-day mode for the first time, walking down the track to Sharma before mistiming a slap across the line. He flicks an inswinger to fine leg for two and then survives a big LBW appeal from a similar delivery. It was going past leg stump. Lovely bowling again from Sharma though, who is swinging it both ways to order.“There are few places on earth with an atmosphere comparable to Tenby on Ironman weekend,” says Matt Dony. “As much as I’d love to spend a lazy weekend at home with cricket and other assorted sports, I will be watching my 6 yr old kick proverbials at Ironkids today, then cheer on the (idiotically fit) dedicated athletes doing the whole shebang tomorrow. Obviously, I’ll be keeping abreast of events with your trusty work, but can I say ‘All the best’ to all competitors in Tenby over the weekend?”94th over: England 204-7 (Buttler 12, Rashid 9) Rashid is beaten, chasing an inswinger from Bumrah. That’s all, you can go now.“Perhaps Leo (93rd over) could rent a sumptuous apartment overlooking Chelmsford ground next summer,” says Josh Cockburn. “I’m sure that would be a similar experience.”93rd over: England 203-7 (Buttler 11, Rashid 9) Rashid survives a huge appeal for LBW from Sharma. India have no reviews remaining, having used them gratuitously yesterday. Not that it would have mattered: Ultra-Edge suggests there was an inside-edge onto pad. Kumar Dharmasena is a fantastic umpire. “Last week I booked a sumptuous apartment overlooking the beautiful cricket ground at Galle in Sri Lanka,” says Leo. “I’ve never seen Alastair Cook bat live and I wanted to remedy that situation before he retired...” That’s such an OBO email. I suspect a few of you have similar stories. Somebody out there must have saved up for years for the trip of a lifetime to the Guyana Test of 1990.92nd over: England 203-7 (Buttler 11, Rashid 9) Jasprit Bumrah first ball is the loosest of looseners that Rashid drives sweetly for four. That takes England past 200. They have only reached 400 once all summer, you know - and that was in a one-day international. There’s a lot of swing for Sharma and Bumrah, which is encouaraging for England’s bowlers.“Somehow, an England collapse has become such a common occurrence, I’m not a stranger to it anymore,” says Saad Sheikh. “As much as I can criticise England for their irresponsible way of playing their cricket, I’d be equally unfair not to say that India haven’t really taken advantage of their low scores either. If Buttler and Rashid can add about 40 runs and Moeen and Anderson get going with the ball, I wouldn’t be that bothered. You wouldn’t be either, would you?”As always when I’m in the OBO chair, I just want cricket to be the winner.91st over: England 198-7 (Buttler 11, Rashid 4) It’s cloudy in south London, which is good news for the swing bowlers on both sides. Jos Buttler, 28 today, starts is beaten twice in an excellent opening over from Ishant Sharma. This has been a brilliant tour for Sharma, who has 18 wickets at 21.66. Only once has he taken more in a series, when he rampaged all over West Indies in 2011.“The Silence of the Lambs,” says Martin Lloyd, continuing yesterday’s theme of cricket film titles. “Just a man, a farm, and no more international cricket.” “Morning Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “Taking stock of yesterday, I was lucky enough to spend 90 minutes in the company of Bumble on Wednesday night, talking a bit about his new book, but a lot about this team. Interestingly, he was insistent that Jennings will come good, and that the England set up thought so too, hence he’ll get the next tour at least. I guess Cook going helps this, but his feet are stone so I fear for him in Sri Lanka. But then what do I know, I’m outside cricket.”He’s a good player of spin, and England will face plenty of that this winter. I think he’ll get the Sri Lanka series at least.There’s a lovely feature on Sky at the moment, with Graham Gooch and Nasser Hussain talking about Alastair Cook’s career. It’s well worth watching on catch-up. There’s a lovely paternal pride in everything Gooch says about Cook. He also says he has only ever taken one photo while on tour: this.Bits and bobsGood day. As weaknesses go, being rubbish at dead rubbers is not so bad. You could even argue it’s a virtue. So let’s give it up for England, because they are useless at them. Whether they have won or lost the series, they tend to get marmalised in the meaningless match at the end. They’ve won only one dead rubber this decade (against India at the Oval, funnily enough), and in recent years have been thrashed by Australia (four times), South Africa and India. England have an excellent chance of maintaining that record after yesterday evening’s spectacular collapse. It was a neat variation on the summer’s defining theme: this time it was the middle rather than the top order that went down in a heap. England were 133 for one before they losing six wickets for 48.They will resume on 198 for seven – not quite as bad as it looks, because the old ball swung throughout the last two sessions. In fact, England are still favourites with the bookies. If it was a live match, I’d give them a fighting chance. In a dead rubber, not so much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c870d6990925cdfac765a8156e8e16e4c9fb69a/0_486_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9720485ad0bbd02e97d33924a7407acc","title":"playwright anna jordan interview","story":"The English dramatist on juggling pregnancy with the opening of two new plays, the joys of YouTube, and how Only Fools and Horses helped her to find loveBorn in west London to actor parents, Anna Jordan trained as an actor at Lamda but later switched to writing and directing. She won the Bruntwood prize for playwrighting in 2013 for Yen, which the  described in a five-star review as “difficult to watch yet easy to love”. Her new play, Pop Music, opens at Birmingham Repertory theatre on 17 September, while a second new play, The Unreturning, premieres at Theatre Royal, Plymouth three days later. Jordan also writes for the TV series Succession on HBO.You’ve got two new plays opening within a few days of each other. Are you tearing your hair out?Well, if you add in the fact that I’m going to have a baby about three weeks before… I’m actually strangely calm. My day consists of opening my laptop, working on the scripts, then small breaks for sleeping, and I’m doing that right up until midnight. But these plays have been a labour of love for a long time, so while there’s still plenty to be done, the ideas are very solid.Pop Music blends songs and story in a really striking way, as two characters meet on a wedding dancefloor. How did it come about?The form of it is something I’ve been playing with for a long time, which is how can you really intertwine text with music. The provocation that I came up with for the play is that pop music makes promises it can’t keep. The two characters, who are in their mid-30s and share a huge love of pop, were made huge promises by their favourite artists in the 80s and 90s that were just not true. I thought it was quite a dark premise, but we did a preview at Latitude festival in July and people were talking about how feelgood and uplifting it is. I suppose the positivity comes from the fact that pop music also has the power to bring people together.Were you listening to music while you were writing it?Yes, all the time. The ideas for quite a few of the plays I’ve written have been generated by music. Actually, Spotify has made a huge difference to the way I write, because I’m so easily able to discover new things. I’ve been building up a Spotify playlist for Pop Music which is actually now available for people coming to watch the show.The Unreturning is a much darker story about war, exile and difficult homecomings.When Neil Bettles of Frantic Assembly came to me with the proposal, it was about the experience of coming home when you’ve been away for a transformative experience. To research it, I’ve been speaking to soldiers who spent time in Afghanistan. I’ve been doing lots of research about world war one at the Imperial War Museum. And I was engaging with refugee stories, and what interested me the most was people returning to Aleppo when it’s absolutely and completely gutted.It’s an interesting time to explore the idea of home in a British context. Did writing the play give you any insights into Brexit-era Britain?Both projects are about nostalgia and looking back, and I think that’s been a subconscious direction I’ve gone in, because I lost my mum two years ago. We were very, very close. So rather than focusing on Brexit, it’s really been about that for me. One strand of the play looks at a future where English people are in a refugee situation, and it was interesting to think that if you are being oppressed in some way, the need to be patriotic grows. The love of England grows when you don’t really have access to England any more. We take our access to our homes quite lightly.When you’re writing, what’s your biggest distraction?Probably the internet. The way that I work is weirdly chaotic and feverish. Having a moment where I check my Facebook timeline or my emails gives my brain a bit of respite. It’s like filling my brain with white noise. But of course, we use the internet so much when we’re writing plays now.In what ways is it useful?YouTube and things like that are really wonderful, because you get real people’s opinions and the way real people speak. I recently wrote a Geordie character and I got this weird bee in my bonnet that I didn’t want to write the character until I learned the accent. And so I did a lot of listening to people on YouTube, which is great because you don’t get a sanitised version of things. But it can also be a real wormhole.You also write for TV. How different is that to writing plays?Very very different. I’ve just been in the writer’s room for HBO’s Succession, created by Jesse Armstrong, who wrote Peep Show and Fresh Meat. I was dropped into this room with the most amazing writers and felt so out of my depth, but Jesse was such a generous showrunner and I got to write an episode. It was a crazy whirlwind. In theatre, you’re left in a room to make what you want to make. But with TV there’s no time for that, so you’re always showing your work. I feel like theatre will always be my first love, but it’s nice to think that I can tell stories in different mediums.What state do you think British theatre is in at the moment and how can it be improved?I’m a Shakespeare fan, but I think there’s too much Shakespeare getting staged. I feel like we’re seeing the same actors all the time. There’s a lot of playing it safe. And getting more people into theatre who haven’t been in theatre before is really important. There’s a producer called Tobi Kyeremateng who runs the black ticket project, where she secures funding to take black people to the theatre. She’s making a really tangible difference, which is really exciting. We’ve got to keep on top of stuff like that.What else are you working on?I’m working on Mother Courage, it’s a HeadlongRoyal Exchange project. I’m also working on my own sitcom, which is quite exciting. In terms of TV, comedy is my first love. I’m obsessed with Only Fools and Horses. John Sullivan is easily my biggest influence.Why are you obsessed with Only Fools and Horses?The dialogue is so funny and so well crafted, but it’s not afraid to go to those sad and dark places and, when it does, it really hits you. I’ll always go back to it. It’s my safety blanket. But also it’s become a really big part of my relationships. Every boyfriend I’ve had has been a massive fan. I met my fiance online and the only reason I responded to him was because he’d seen I was an Only Fools and Horses super-fan and he sent me an Only Fools and Horses trivia question as an ice-breaker. Then we met up and we’ve been together ever since. So it’s got a lot to answer for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711ac3e8613daf07464fb17834b3819110b8332a/0_95_2070_1243/master/2070.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3423a077170a3445555198227006877a 1000w","title":"tesla chief elon musk smokes marijuana on live web show","story":"The company’s head of accounting, Dave Morton, and head of human resources, Gaby Toledano, said they were leaving the company, which has been placed at the centre of a string of controversies by its maverick CEO.Morton, who joined the company just one month ago, said he was leaving because “the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations”.“This caused me to reconsider my future. I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting.”Morton joined the company one day before Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private with “funding secured”. The plan was abandoned 17 days later, but not after drawing a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a series of lawsuits alleging market manipulation.Toledano, who has been on leave of absence from the company, told Bloomberg she would not be returning to the firm.The pair quit a day after Musk provoked fresh concern after smoking marijuana on a live web show with US comedian Joe Rogan.Musk, 47, spent two-and-half hours on the streamed podcast late on Thursday discussing everything from artificial intelligence and its impact on humankind to flame throwers and social media.Taking a puff from a joint – which Rogan said was a blend of tobacco and marijuana and is legal in California – Musk said he “almost never” smoked. “I’m not a regular smoker of weed,” Musk said. “I don’t actually notice any effect … I don’t find that it is very good for productivity.”Musk stunned investors last month with tweets saying he had funding to take the company private for $420 (£323) a share. He then backed off from his plan saying Tesla was better off as a public company.Asked about the wisdom of smoking marijuana while he is under investigation by the SEC for the “take private” tweet, Musk told the  by email: “ is the most insufferable newspaper on planet Earth”.Musk did not immediately respond to additional questions about his behaviour or comments on the podcast.Earlier this week Musk escalated his baseless attacks against the British er Vernon Unsworth, claiming that the man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a “child rapist” in an email to a reporter. Neither Tesla nor Musk have commented on the Buzzfeed report.Musk first called the er Unsworth a “pedo” in a July tweet – an unfounded claim against a man who was part of the international team that freed 12 young footballers and their coach from the Tham Luang cave complex. Musk, who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist the rescue mission, eventually apologised to Unsworth.Musk’s behaviour has raised concerns about his leadership and several Wall Street analysts have called for the company to appoint a strong deputy to prop up Tesla’s operations and standing with investors.“We have been calling for a Co-CEO or COO to assist to codifying the leadership structure and in so doing, the culture at Tesla,” said James Albertine, an analyst at brokerage Consumer Edge. “We think this is further evidence that the time is now for management and the board to address these issues.”Many senior executives have quit Tesla recently. In the first three months of the year, the company lost Morton’s predecessor, Eric Branderiz and Susan Repo, who was treasurer and vice president of finance. Chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja retired in 2015, but returned in 2017 after his successor, Jason Wheeler, quit after 15 months.On Friday afternoon, Musk told Tesla employees to ignore what he called “a lot of fuss and noise in the media” in an all-staff email published on the company blog. Musk also announced a number of internal promotions to fill vacant executive positions, including the elevation of Jerome Guillen to the newly created role of president of automotive operations.Many of Musk’s Twitter followers questioned if smoking marijuana was against the company’s policy, while others mocked the CEO’s initial $420 bid, a number that has become code for marijuana.“Elon getting high on weed and whiskey is the first reason to go long on $TSLA in a while. He needs to relax a bit,” one Twitter user said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f406f86cb13df31264e640e04dc63ba3cf18c54d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b83194c425decf7d19cc9f2067a17c","title":"decentralisation next big step for the world wide web dweb data internet censorship brewster kahle","story":"The decentralised web, or DWeb, could be a chance to take control of our data back from the big tech firms. So how does it work and when will it be here?The story that broke earlier last month that Google would again cooperate with Chinese authorities to run a censored version of its search engine, something the tech giant has neither confirmed nor denied, had ironic timing. The same day, a group of 800 web builders and others – among them Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web – were meeting in San Francisco to discuss a grand idea to circumvent internet gatekeepers like Google and Facebook. The event they had gathered for was the Decentralised Web Summit, held from 31 July to 2\u0026nbspAugust, and hosted by the Internet Archive. The proponents of the so-called decentralised web – or DWeb – want a new, better web where the entire planet’s population can communicate without having to rely on big companies that amass our data for profit and make it easier for governments to conduct surveillance. And its proponents have got projects and apps that are beginning to function, funding that is flowing and social momentum behind them. In light of the Snowden revelations and Cambridge Analytica scandal, public\u0026nbspconcerns around spying and privacy have grown. And more people have heard about the DWeb thanks to the television comedy Silicon Valley, whose main character recently pivoted his startup to try and build this “new internet”.What is the decentralised web? It is supposed to be like the web you know but without relying on centralised operators. In the early days of the world wide web, which came into existence in 1989, you connected directly with your friends through desktop computers that talked to each other. But from the early 2000s, with the advent of Web 2.0, we began to communicate with each other and share information through centralised services provided by big companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. It is now on Facebook’s platform, in its so called “walled garden”, that you talk to your friends. “Our laptops have become just screens. They cannot do anything useful without the cloud,” says Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Blockstack, a platform for building decentralised apps. The DWeb is about re-decentralising things – so we aren’t reliant on these intermediaries to connect us. Instead users keep control of their data and connect and interact and exchange messages directly with others in their network.Why do we need an\u0026nbspalternative? With the current web, all that user data concentrated in the hands of a few creates risk that our data will be hacked. It also makes it easier for governments to conduct surveillance and impose censorship. And if any of these centralised entities shuts down, your data and connections are lost. Then there are privacy concerns stemming from the business models of many of the companies, which use the private information we provide freely to target us with ads. “The services are kind of creepy in how much they know about you,” says Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive. The DWeb, say proponents, is about giving people a choice: the same services, but decentralised and not creepy. It promises control and privacy, and things can’t all of a sudden disappear because someone decides they should. On the DWeb, it would be harder for the Chinese government to block a site it didn’t like, because the information can come from other places.Is this something to do with that word “blockchain”? Blockchain technology is the secure, encrypted technology that\u0026nbspcryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ether run off. It provides a decentralised public digital ledger of transactions, which tracks ownership securely in an environment without trust. While the first applications of blockchain technology were for digital currency transactions, that same technology is now finding application in the development of the DWeb including recording the movement of data, registering unique user names and even data storage. There are also cryptocurrencies themselves being deployed to help create the DWeb. For example, Protocol Labs launched\u0026nbspFilecoin in August last year having raised $205m for the project. The idea is to incentivise the creation of a decentralised data\u0026nbspstorage network by creating an open market in data storage. If you have spare capacity, you can store others’ data and earn Filecoin. If you\u0026nbspwant your extra data stored, you\u0026nbspcan find someone on the network and pay them in Filecoin. The deals get recorded on a blockchain.How will my everyday experience of using the\u0026nbspweb change? If it is done right, say enthusiasts, either you won’t notice or it will be better. One thing that is likely to change is that you will pay for more stuff directly – think micropayments based on cryptocurrency – because the business model of advertising to us based on our data won’t work well in the DWeb. Want to listen to songs someone has recorded and put on a decentralised website? Drop a coin in the cryptocurrency box in exchange for a decryption key and you can listen. Another difference is that most passwords could disappear. One of the first things you will need to use the DWeb is your own unique, secure identity, says Blockstack’s Ali. You will have one really long and unrecoverable password known only to you but which works\u0026nbspeverywhere on the DWeb and with which you will be able to connect to any decentralised app. Lose your unique password, though, and you lose access to everything.Any downsides? What might go wrong? Without the big online intermediaries to exercise their central control, there is the potential for online harassment and hate speech to increase.“Censorship – both by good people and bad – is going to be harder,” says Kahle. And if information is stored in a decentralised way, how do you ever truly get rid of information you no longer want to have online? That could be a concern for the European “right to be forgotten”.The same tech that can protect users in the DWeb from central surveillance might also offer a shield to criminals, for example distributors of child abuse images. If\u0026nbspthe DWeb is allowing people to store files and data totally encrypted,\u0026nbspso nobody can see them, it means they can store or share images they shouldn’t be. Though, says Sander Pick, co-founder of Textile, that’s not a problem unique\u0026nbspto the DWeb, with purveyors of child abuse images using various encryption techniques and\u0026nbspanonymous networks to hide on\u0026nbspthe web we have today.What challenges does the DWeb face? What’s holding things back? First, it is technically more difficult to build a decentralised web because everything isn’t in one place. Then there’s getting people to use it. “Right now humanity lives at Facebook,” says Mitchell Baker, chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation. A killer app, a thing that everyone wants, could help here – but there isn’t one yet. Though that is neither surprising nor a failure given how early it still is, adds Baker. Many of the apps that do exist are clunky and difficult to use user experience needs to improve.The DWeb movement also needs to focus on its true advantages – the things centralised systems can’t do, says Juan Benet, founder of Protocol Labs. And one of those is speed. Because of the way the DWeb\u0026nbspworks\u0026nbspdifferently from the current web, it should intrinsically be faster, but there is a long way to go on that, he says. There are also big issues about governance that need to be ironed out, says Primavera De Filippi, who studies the legal and organisational challenges of decentralised technologies at the National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet \u0026amp Society at Harvard University. How does the decentralised web all come together when no one is in charge? And how do you make sure things don’t just become centralised again, the system repeating itself, particularly when there are companies that want\u0026nbspto make money?How big online companies push back also remains to be seen. “There are going to be a lot of forces for the\u0026nbspstatus quo,” says Kahle. The DWeb is new and burgeoning, but\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspalso isn’t inevitable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42fe1f1422d0565fb3f23c345cc8af89cb5c91e4/0_1167_3840_2303/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=017bb6a6a522b94e9e41bd10fab1f818","title":"youtube stars burnout fun bleak stressed","story":"Why are so many YouTubers finding themselves stressed, lonely and exhausted?When Matt Lees became a full-time YouTuber, he felt as if he had won the lottery. As a young, ambitious writer, director and presenter, he was able to create low-budget, high-impact films that could reach a worldwide audience, in a way that would have been impossible without the blessing of television’s gatekeepers just a few years earlier. In February 2013, he had his first viral hit, an abridged version of Sony’s announcement of its PlayStation 4 video game console, dubbed with a cheerily acerbic commentary. Within days the video had been watched millions of times. “It hardly seems viral at all, by today’s standards,” Lees says, yet it was one of the most viewed videos on YouTube that month. The boost to Lees’ ego was nothing compared with the effect it had on his career. When YouTube’s algorithm notices this sort of success, it starts directing viewers to the uploader’s other videos, earning the channel more subscribers and, via the snippety advertisements that play before each one, higher income. Overnight, Lees had what seemed like the first shoots of a sustainable career.Excitement soon gave way to anxiety. Even in 2013, Lees was aware that his success depended not so much on smash hits as on day-by-day reliability. “It’s not enough to simply create great things,” he says. “The audience expect consistency. They expect frequency. Without these, it’s incredibly easy to slip off the radar and lose favour with the algorithm that gave you your wings.” By the end of the year Lees had grown his channel from 1,000 subscribers to 90,000, and caught the attention of one of his influences, Charlie Brooker, who invited Lees to collaborate on writing a Channel 4 special. For a month Lees worked 20-hour days, iding his time between the TV script work and, ever conscious that missing a day’s upload could cause his videos to tumble down the search rankings, his YouTube channel.At the end of the month he was pale, gaunt and tired in a way that, he recalls, seemed “impervious to rest”. His work, he noticed, had become increasingly rushed and harsh in tone. Yet the angry, provocative quality of his videos seemed only to be making them more popular. “Divisive content is the king of online media today, and YouTube heavily boosts anything that riles people up,” he says. “It’s one of the most toxic things: the point at which you’re breaking down is the point at which the algorithm loves you the most.”Lees began to feel a knock-on effect on his health. “Human brains really aren’t designed to be interacting with hundreds of people every day,” he says. “When you’ve got thousands of people giving you direct feedback on your work, you really get the sense that something in your mind just snaps. We just aren’t built to handle empathy and sympathy on that scale.” Lees developed a thyroid problem, and began to experience more frequent and persistent stretches of depression. “What started out as being the most fun job imaginable quickly slid into something that felt deeply bleak and lonely,” he says.For years, YouTubers have believed that they are loved most by their audience when they project a chirpy, grateful image. But what happens when the mask slips? This year there has been a wave of videos by prominent YouTubers talking about their burnout, chronic fatigue and depression. “This is all I ever wanted,” said Elle Mills, a 20-year-old Filipino-Canadian YouTuber in a (monetised) video entitled Burnt Out At 19, posted in May. “And why the fuck am I so unfucking unhappy? It doesn’t make any sense. You know what I mean? Because, like, this is literally my fucking dream. And I’m fucking so un-fucking-happy.”Mills had gained a lot of attention (and 3.6m views) for a slick and cleverly edited five-minute video she posted last November in which she came out as bisexual to her friends, family and followers (many of whom had been asking about her sexuality in the comments). She went on to be featured on the cover of Diva magazine, and won a Shorty award for “breakout YouTuber”. But six months later she posted the Burnt Out video, explaining how her schoolgirl ambition of becoming a YouTuber had led her to bigger and bigger audiences, but that “it’s not what I expected. I’m always stressed. My anxiety and depression keep getting worse. I’m waiting to hit my breaking point.”The same month Rubén “El Rubius” Gundersen, a 28-year-old Spaniard who is currently the world’s third most popular YouTuber, with more than 30 million subscribers, talked about how he felt as if he was heading for a breakdown, and had, as a result, decided to take a break. They are the latest in a string of high-profile YouTubers, including Erik Phillips (better known as M3RKMUS1C, with 4 million subscribers) and Benjamin Vestergaard (Crainer, with 2.8 million), to have announced hiatuses from the channel, or described their struggles with exhaustion.The anxieties are tied up with the relentless nature of their work. Tyler Blevins, AKA Ninja, makes an estimated $500,000 (£384,000) every month via live broadcasts of him playing the video game Fortnite on Twitch, a service for livestreaming video games that is owned by Amazon. Most of Blevins’ revenue comes from Twitch subscribers or viewers who provide one-off donations (often in the hope that he will thank them by name “on air”). Blevins recently took to Twitter to complain that he didn’t feel he could stop streaming. “Wanna know the struggles of streaming over other jobs?” he wrote, perhaps ill-advisedly for someone with such a stratospheric income. “I left for less than 48 hours and lost 40,000 subscribers on Twitch. I’ll be back today… grinding again.”There was little sympathy on Twitter for the millionaire. But the pressure he described is felt at every level of success, from the titans of the content landscape all the way down to the people with channels with just a few thousand subscribers, all of whom feel they must be constantly creating, always available and responding to their fans. “Constant releases build audience loyalty,” says Austin Hourigan, who runs ShoddyCast, a YouTube channel with 1.2 million subscribers. “The more loyalty you build, the more likely your viewers are to come back, which gives you the closest thing to a financial safety net in what is otherwise a capricious space.”When a YouTuber passes the 1 million subscribers mark, they are presented with a gold plaque to mark the event. Many of these plaques can be seen on shelves and walls in the background of presenters’ rooms. In this way, the size of viewership and quantity of uploads become the main markers of value.Professional YouTubers speak in tones at once reverential and resentful of the power of “the Algorithm” (it’s seen as a near-sentient entity, not only by creators, but also by YouTube’s own engineers). Created by the high priests of Silicon Valley, who continually tweak its characteristics, this is the programming code on which the fate of every YouTuber depends. It decides which videos to pluck from the Niagara of content that splashes on to YouTube every hour (400 hours’ worth every 60 seconds, according to Google) to deliver as “recommended viewing” to the service’s billions of users.Every time you log on to YouTube you are presented with videos chosen by the algorithm. The idea is that a clip particularly well suited to your tastes will inspire you to click the Subscribe button – which, hopefully, will bring you back to watch a new episode tomorrow. The viewer feels that YouTube understands what he or she likes, while advertisers are reassured that the video in front of which their five-second commercial will run will reach an appropriately targeted audience.When your income is dependent on the number of people who watch your videos each week, this code can decide what, or even whether, you eat. And, 13 years into YouTube’s existence, many believe it has come to sit at the core of a growing mental health crisis among video creators.In April this year there was a particularly extreme example, when 38-year-old Nasim Najafi Aghdam entered YouTube’s Californian campus and opened fire on employees with a 9mm pistol, wounding three before she killed herself. A video Aghdam uploaded prior to the attack suggested that it was driven by her belief that the company’s algorithm had passed over her videos in March she posted on Instagram, “All my YouTube channels got filtered by YouTube so my videos hardly get views.”Algorithm-led content curation makes creators feel disposable, challenging them to churn out videos in the knowledge that there are younger, fresher people waiting in the wings to replace them. For YouTubers who use their daily lives as raw material for their videos, there is added pressure, as the traditional barriers between personal and professional life are irreparably eroded.At a recent party at a conference for YouTubers and streamers, Hourigan was standing with a group of YouTubers when he quipped: “I think every YouTube career should come with a coupon for a free therapist.” Everybody laughed, he recalls, but “in a sad way”.“By the way,” he adds, “I’m medicated and have a therapist.”Katherine Lo is a researcher into online communities at the University of California, Irvine. For her, it’s not simply the frequency and consistency of content creation that lead to burnout, but the specific nature of the work required to keep audiences engaged, which includes being active on social media, interacting with fans, and other roles beyond writing, presenting and editing. “This kind of labour is often invisible but very taxing and a major contributor to occupational stress,” Lo explains. “In many cases it can contribute to PTSD, especially when creators are subject to harassment, threats to their safety and privacy, or ongoing toxicity in their community.”She recently developed a list of occupational factors that contribute to mental health risks for creators. It includes the exhaustion that comes from performing “familiarity” with the audience, the stress of reading comments, the financial anxiety associated with managing sponsorships and donations, and the pressure of managing reputation and professional ties in the YouTuber community, where recommendations are key to getting fans.Those who work on larger channels, which have enough money to employ a staff and spread the pressure, are not immune to these risks. Belinda Zoller joined the team behind the Extra Credits YouTube channel in 2016. The channel publishes weekly lessons in video game design and world history, using cheery animations. It has close to 1.6 million subscribers Zoller works as a moderator, responding to comments. Moderation is one of the most gruelling jobs in the web’s emergent economy, and while Zoller does not work in front of the camera, her role puts her in the firing line for anonymous abuse and bad-faith interaction. Within months she was exhausted. “There is a lot of emotional labour involved in my work,” she says. “I empathise with the root of people’s concerns and criticisms, even if I disagree with some of them.”Zoller views YouTube as her primary “office space” – a shift that, she says, has “very much negatively impacted my mental health”. No matter how much she enjoys helping to run a popular channel, the platform itself is steeped in negativity. Moderating comments in order to maintain a clean and safe online space is like weeding a garden: every time a root is pulled up, another three nose through the soil in its place. Zoller believes that, far from wanting to deal with the negativity, YouTube actively encourages it via the design of the algorithm. “People tend not to discuss content unless they have very strong opinions about it, and most of the time those strong opinions favour disagreement,” she explains. “So the algorithm favours clickbait and controversial content over meaningfully nuanced and positive content.”For Lo, video-based social media platforms are catastrophically failing those who sustain their business. “YouTube fails to protect creators from the extremely common occupational hazards of being doxxed, stalked, harassed and threatened online,” she says. (Doxxing is the revealing of someone’s identity or other personal information.) “They claim no responsibility for the wellbeing of their creators or the communities they create.”Asked about Lo’s comments, a spokeswoman for YouTube replies: “Harassment is abhorrent and wrong. YouTube has policies against harassment and bullying, as indicated in our community guidelines. We review flagged content quickly, and remove inappropriate videos according to our policies.” In order to avoid burnout, it encourages creators to “take breaks, enjoy weekends, nights and vacations just like any job”. “Of course,” the spokeswoman adds, “we always hope creators are discussing their struggles openly with others in the YouTube community.”As part of its Creator Academy, a vast online “school” covering everything from how to “enhance your channel’s search and discovery potential” to how to “make deals with brands”, YouTube recently commissioned a series of videos designed to teach its partners how to avoid fatigue. (Few of the people I speak to who run YouTube channels are aware of the resource.) The video on burnout has been viewed just over 32,000 times. It’s written and presented by 34-year-old Kati Morton. A licensed therapist based in Los Angeles, Morton has been posting videos to YouTube for eight years. As such, she is well placed to understand both the problem and the potential solution.In 2010, when she started her channel, Morton was working as a therapist with a private practice. YouTube was her way to reach a wider audience with tips and information that she believed could help them. Three years ago, her success on the platform enabled her to become a full-time YouTuber, but learning to personally manage the pressures she had warned about has been challenging. “I am no better than anyone else,” she says. “I’ve got tired, stressed about everything. It was a journey to get to the place where I felt able to tell my audience that I would be taking a vacation.”That holiday, a two-week break last Christmas, was the first Morton had taken since going full-time in 2015. “Maybe I took a long weekend the summer before, for our anniversary?” she says. “No. Wait. I worked then, too.”Every time Morton posts a new video she is expected to be in the comments, responding to questions and suggestions, before starting work on the next. “I have trouble with boundaries,” she says. “I always feel like I should be working, or that they’re counting on me.”Like all YouTubers, Morton also feels the financial pressure of the system, which typically pays between £1.50 and £3 for every 1,000 views. “The reward for your work is liable to change at any time,” she says. “Your views can go down for a variety of reasons, and when that happens, you earn less.” For this reason, even with close to half a million subscribers, Morton feels unable to employ anyone to help her with the workload.YouTube recommends that creators who are struggling “enlist support”. Morton argues that, for the majority, it is an impossible expense. “If I had someone supporting me it would make all the difference,” she says. “But I’d need my daily views to double before I’d feel comfortable doing that. Could you imagine having to fire someone because my views went down? That would be awful.”For her, the solution comes back to the algorithm. “YouTube rewards people who produce daily,” she says. “They made the algorithm, so they have the power to remake it. If they set different criteria, it would help. We are human beings. We need some time for ourselves.”Matt Lees is furious at what he sees as YouTube’s lacklustre approach to support and advice. “Encouraging creators to ‘take a break’ is pretty laughable from a system that actively promotes quantity over quality,” he says. “There’s no sense of responsibility for the culture that YouTube has created.” For Katherine Lo, the capacity to maintain a healthy worklife balance while being successful on YouTube and Twitch is a “barely possible” dream. “ They offer highly precarious work, where the promise of robust success – where one has a reliable, sustainable income – is only enjoyed by a small percentage of creators. Trying to reduce frequency of content and establish worklife balance merely adds even more risk.”The demands of the YouTuber life suit younger creators – and the largest demographic on the site is those in their 20s (when once teenagers may have dreamed of becoming pop stars, now they dream of becoming YouTubers). Many find it possible to keep creating at a high enough rate, if only for a few years. “At that age you absolutely can,” Lees says. “You’ve got the energy and focus to work incredibly long hours, you’ve got very few responsibilities to take your attention away from work, and – perhaps most importantly – you’ve likely still got a solid social circle, friendships that aren’t difficult to maintain.” But, as every casualty of childhood stardom demonstrates, early success carries with it tremendous risk.“The journey to creative stardom used to take more time – learning the ropes and developing a thick skin, and having a team of advisers and trusted friends,” says Chris O’Sullivan, from the UK charity the Mental Health Foundation. “Today, you can become a superstar online with one viral video – at any age or stage and from any location. Without support and guidance, the potential to be burned by the exposure is great.”As time goes on, and life grows more complicated, the sense of isolation, anxiety and weariness is exacerbated.“I spent my 20s working ceaselessly, feeling invincible and boundless,” Lees says. “And honestly, I was. Right up until the point where I wasn’t.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.Commenting on this piece?

Was discovered in 1991 in the Ötztal Alps alongside a mummified man whom scientists dubbed Ötzi the Iceman. The man and the remains of the backpack, which would have consisted of a cloth or animal skin bag on a wooden frame, date back to between 3400 and 3100BC.An expedition set out in 1519 led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was aiming to discover a western spice route. Unfortunately, he died in the Philippines in 1521, and Juan Sebastián Elcano took over. After three years, the voyage proved the world was not only round but also a lot larger than previously thought. Of the 240-man expedition, Elcano and 17 crew were the only ones to make it all the way around, returning to Spain in 1522.In the 1950s and 60s, young people seeking spirituality, freedom and cheap marijuana began travelling overland from Europethrough Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to India and Nepal, and sometimes Thailand. They packed light and kept costs low by hitchhiking and taking buses. This “hippy trail” came to an end in 1979, when the Iranian revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan closed the route. But Asia is still the most popular place for first-timers.In 1972, Maureen and Tony Wheeler travelled overland from London to Australia. After arriving in Melbourne, Tony wrote Across Asia on the Cheap, the first Lonely Planet guidebook. It listed, in some detail, the quality of dope on offer along the route and gave advice on the best places for travellers to donate blood for money (Kuwait) if running low on funds.32: Average backpacker age in 2016, according to Holidaysafe – up from 25 in 2014.179: Average length of trip in days in 2016 (down from 217 in 2014), according to Holidaysafe.4: The most common number of beds in a dorm, according to Hostelgeeks.

Now, in the digital age, things have become more complicated...Safe to say that we know what Love Island is now: people with six packs or eyelash extensions saying, “Where’s your head at right now?” for eight straight weeks Caroline Flack nominally hosts. And, crucially, that it is a statistical outlier in terms of TV dating shows: Love Island, above every other, offers a genuine chance at love. Winners Jack and Dani may be set to make £2m in the next year alone, but the real prize is an unshakeable bond between their two tanned Essex souls and a lifetime spent hugging, squabbling and going to barbecues with Danny Dyer together. Truly, it is the dream.What if you can’t get two months off work to go graft in a villa, though? Well, you have two options: go for the Saturday night blockbuster gloss of Blind Date and Take Me Out – essentially the same show on different channels, where a man in a suit watches people stand on podiums and flirt loudly while occasionally saying “Woo!” to an appreciative studio audience. Or, you go weirder. What about Sexy Beasts (people dressed in monstrous prosthetics go to a normal bar for a very, very weird first date)? Or Naked Attraction (featuring a junk-up slow reveal, like a dick pic-first version of Tinder)? How about Hello Stranger (a hypnotist temporarily makes a couple forget they are in love and they go dating again)? Why do we love dating shows so much we’d watch even the very weirdest formats?Matt Edmondson, narrator and format creator of Dress to Impress (horny people run around Westfield trying to buy an outfit for an unseen partner), broadly agrees. “I am obsessed with the idea that no matter how mad the premise of the show, the law of averages suggests that one or two of them may actually find a genuine connection and form a relationship,” he says. “I think we can all place ourselves in the position of the contributors and think: ‘What would I do in this situation?’ I remain convinced that were I not a happily married man I could get a handful of lights left on during Take Me Out by performing the one card trick I know, badly.” That’s fine for the more normal dating shows (First Dates, for example), but in the 30-plus years since Blind Date made flirty banter a Saturday night mainstay, dating shows have gone considerably off-piste.Just this year, Seven Year Switch introduced a panic-attack of a format to British TV (couples in failing long-term relationships go to Thailand and switch partners for a fortnight to see if that fixes anything), while BBC Two ran the Sara Cox-fronted Love in the Countryside (people from the countryside go on dates near pigs). We even have dating shows for relationships that have ended, such as Channel 5’s One Night With My Ex. We have dating shows that crash the concepts of “new relationships” and “dead relationships” together, as with MTV’s Ex on the Beach. In 2016, it seemed every dating show was naked: Naked Attraction, Undressed and the American Dating Naked pushed pixel blurs to the logical extreme. It’s hard not to watch these shows and think: ‘Who goes on these, and why?’“I liked the fact that this is really the only true way you can go on a blind date now,” says Lucy Cox, a 32-year-old events manager from London, who ended up on Dinner Date. “If a friend sets you up with someone, you can hardcore social media stalk them and know what they had for dinner yesterday before you’ve even met them. I got home drunk one night and applied and forgot about it, then three months later they called.”After a successful episode of Dinner Date, Lucy and her winning date David hit it off, and now it’s three years later and they have a cat together. Is it embarrassing telling people you met on a show where the commiseration prize is a microwave meal? “I think I’m more impressed if people met on Tinder,” Lucy says. “In my experience, it was full of sociopathic time-wasters.”“They paid £150 a day,” George, a 24-year-old bar manager from London, says, slightly more straightforwardly. George was one of the prospective daters on Puppy Playdate, an as-yet unaired show where … well, you get it. “My hairdresser cuts the head of casting’s hair at this production company and gave him my number. The premise is that a girl has a dog and three guys have to take that dog out on a date. I did ‘doga’ on my date, which is dog yoga. After all the dates the dog has to choose which bloke it likes best and then he goes on a date with the girl. The dog had a wag-o-meter. It was genuinely mental, mate.”I ask biological anthropologist Helen Fisher to watch an episode of Take Me Out to ascertain why it is dating shows are so enduringly compelling. “Courtship is about winning,” she says, having watched a model and a student wave at a studio audience before going off on holiday together. “You’re trying to win life’s greatest prize: a mating partner. And if you have the opportunity to go on national television, that’s advertising you’re advertising to a very large group of people who can see you and hear you. It’s way better than a dating site.” For Helen, modern dating shows are an extension of the way in which the dating landscape has changed over the last 20 years, with the advent of apps and dating sites. “These days we have to advertise ourselves. Our parents aren’t introducing us to people, a great many of us know all the people in our social group, and so all of these contestants are stepping away from their normal daily means of attracting a partner and going for a broader pool of people who might be interested in them.”Edmondson agrees. “Tinder as a format is amazing, but people are looking to escape the norms a bit, which is where the mad dating shows come in to their own,” he says. “The theory behind them often sounds quite compelling, too. You’re going to see them naked eventually, so why not make it the first thing you do? Suddenly, Naked Attraction is born. It’s the same with Dress to Impress. There is an element of you that hopefully thinks: ‘Well, I’ve not met anyone through traditional means … but what if I could meet my dream partner because I like the leggings they’ve bought for me?’ People have met in weirder ways.”Talk to enough people and you’ll realise everyone in the UK is six degrees of separation away from a TV dating show contestant: nans, brothers, friends, dogs. This, truly, is what drives our insatiable bloodlust for watching people flirt awkwardly and occasionally get off with each other: the fact that, out there, at any one time, there is a pulsating world of singletons, tired of the swipe-and-ghost cycle and dedicated enough to sit through a full day’s filming in pursuit of something more. After all, isn’t that what love is all about? Doing kick-ups in front of 30 girls while Paddy McGuinness shouts at you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcf71fac517d9afd107aa38529aaf2715c0c182d/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d43f0a912d9cfb78eef2b2f1d372e49","title":"barack obama california rally democrats midterms house","story":"Former president to speak at Anaheim convention center as party operatives focus on seven key seatsBarack Obama’s dramatic foray into the midterm election season rolls into California on Saturday, as the former president headlines a rally to stir the Democratic party faithful and boost candidates in seven congressional races seen as key to winning control of the House of Representatives in November.Having seized the limelight at the University of Illinois on Friday with an electric speech denouncing the isiveness and resentment of Trump-era politics, Obama will address an invitation-only audience at the Anaheim convention center, a stone’s throw from Disneyland in the vast suburbs between Los Angeles and San Diego.It is a part of the Golden State that is rapidly ransforming from rock-ribbed Republican to solid Democratic blue thanks to demographic shifts and a marked local distaste for the Trump brand of conservative politics.Four of the congressional candidates who will share the stage with the former president are fighting for Republican-held seats less than an hour’s drive away. All seven are competing in districts that favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election.In contrast to Friday’s event in Illinois, when Obama was addressing students and urging them to make themselves heard at the ballot box, the California rally will be aimed primarily at Democratic operatives and their key supporters. Despite some clamor for tickets after the event was announced two days ago, the event is closed to the public.The former president remains broadly popular in California and has just had a street named after him in an up-and-coming, historically African American section of Los Angeles. While he visited frequently, both as a candidate and as president – Los Angeles in particular grew to fear the “Obamajams” his motorcade would invariably create on the freeways – he usually came for fundraisers and never held a major public rally because electoral logic tended to draw his attention elsewhere.As Obama said in Illinois, though: “This moment really is different. The stakes really are higher.” And California, for once, is front and centre in the struggle to turn the House back to Democratic control for the first time in eight years.The two most powerful incumbent Republicans in the contested districts – Darrell Issa, a former House oversight committee chair, and Ed Royce, chair of the foreign affairs committee – are retiring. Their seats are seen as particularly ripe for the taking.Also seen as particularly vulnerable is Dana Rohrabacher, known for his close ties to Russia, who was recently featured in Sacha Baron Cohen’s TV show Who Is America? speaking in favor of arming schoolchildren. Rohrabacher’s opponent, Harley Rouda, took the opportunity to paint Rohrabacher as both gullible and extreme. Rohrabacher countered that the show was nothing but a “sick fraud”.Democratic operatives believe they’ll need to win at least four of the seven seats if they are to stand a chance of reaching the net gain of 23 seats they need to take control of the House. Winning all seven appears eminently possible, and in a particularly good showing might extend that to three or four more seats in California currently scored as leaning Republican.What haunts party leaders, though, is the historically poor showing of rank-and-file Democrats in midterm elections. While they are seeing evidence of far greater motivation than usual among their supporters, as well as a surge of new candidates for office, they will be looking to Obama and other Democratic stars to keep the faithful laser-focused on the task at hand – and reach out to disaffected Republicans and independents while they are at it.Obama’s message in Illinois seemed designed to straddle the twin aims of motivating the base and appealing to a saner, more inclusive, less isive style of politics. He is expecting to carry that message over as his campaign tour continues, first in California and then in Ohio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b439c851a8037ee29651bd5bed4ff3addb54e9/0_219_6360_3816/master/6360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc87e9370e05271a58efe7ecfca7f903","title":"iran russia turkey leaders meet talks syria idlib putin rouhani erdogan","story":"Putin and Rouhani ignore Turkish efforts to avoid mass casualties as US warns of possible chemical weapons attackAn all-out assault on the rebel enclave of Idlib in north-west Syria drew closer on Friday after Russia and Iran rejected a Turkish call to back a ceasefire. The move, at a stormy summit in Tehran, left the three countries to paper over their differences through a broadly worded joint statement calling for all sides to back a political settlement to end Syria’s civil war.The outcome of the summit led to warnings from the west that Russia was pushing Syria towards the edge of an abyss, while US officials claimed it had evidence that the Syrian government was preparing to use chemical weapons.At a closing press conference, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani openly clashed with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Putin insisted that the removal of terrorists from Idlib was the first priority.Erdoğan at the last minute urged his fellow leaders to include a ceasefire in the text of the final communique, but Putin said the armed opposition groups, including those designated terrorists, were not present at the talks, so no such commitment could be made.It is unclear whether Russia will now order Syrian government forces to pause in the face of Erdoğan’s resistance, and growing warnings from the west of a humanitarian disaster if a full-scale military escalation goes ahead.The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, urged Putin to allow more time for efforts to separate UN-designated terrorists from within the the population of Idlib. de Mistura said this was feasible if Turkey was given time to mobilise civilians in Idlib to send a message to the fighters to evacuate the towns and villages. He held up candles to symbolise the wishes of the civilian population.At the Tehran summit Erdoğan warned: “Any assault, whatever the reason for it, will inevitably lead to a catastrophe, killings and a major human tragedy. We never want to see Idlib to turn into a lake of blood. We have to find a rational way out in Idlib that could meet our security concerns.” He added that millions of refugees would flee towards Turkey if a major attack against rebels took place.As many as 3.5 million people live in the Idlib region, the final enclave holding out against the regime of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Almost half of them have been displaced from other towns recaptured by the Syrian government, such as Homs, Aleppo and Ghouta, and have nowhere left to escape within Syria.Erdoğan explained that Turkey had neither “the strength or capability” to host a fresh influx of refugees, raising the prospect that refugees would head to Europe.But Putin insisted that the UN-designated jihadist terrorists inside Idlib had to be removed, and implied that Turkey had already tried and failed to negotiate their voluntary removal to separate them from legitimate opposition groups. Putin said Russia found it “unacceptable” when civilians were used a pretext to “shield terrorists” and target Syrian government positions.He added: “We hope that representatives of terrorist organisations will have enough common sense to stop resistance and lay down their weapons.”Putin’s rejection of a ceasefire was backed by Rouhani, who insisted that there could be no compromise. “It is necessary for the fight to continue until all terrorist groups in Syria, especially in Idlib, are eradicated.” The Russian stance led to condemnation by western diplomats at an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, accused Russia of using the “playbook of death” and said any attack on Idlib would be considered a serious escalation. François Delattre, the French ambassador to the UN, warned that Syria “was at the edge of an abyss”, and said Russia would be held responsible if a massacre occurred.The UK ambassador, Karen Pierce, said there were more babies than terrorists in Idlib, and named the Syrian forces preparing to attack the region, promising that they would be held accountable if indiscriminate attacks on civilians went ahead.John Ging, the UN’s senior humanitarian official, said: “Idlib has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency on a scale not yet seen in this crisis.”HTS is designated by the UN as a terrorist group, and has been sending weaponised drones towards Russian positions. De Mistura has estimated that there are 10,000 UN-designated terrorists in the region. Russia puts the figure higher.Turkish troops are stationed at 12 observation points inside Idlib, over an area of 6,000 sq miles, sent to the region as part of an earlier de-escalation agreement. Turkey will now have to decide how to make sure they do not become collateral damage in the attack. Earlier, the US said there was significant evidence that chemical weapons were being prepared by Syrian government forces. The warning was made by the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey. The US has repeatedly said it would not tolerate a chemical attack, but has not said how it would respond.Jeffrey said: “I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings. Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation. There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared.”Separately, Russia has warned the US to move a small group of troops out of a base in southern Syria, saying it intends to attack the area where the Al Tanf US airbase is located due to the presence of militants. The Pentagon has ordered its troops to remain at the base."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6ddcf61bb9e48fb6e90dff54a34f683d99b0b4/0_40_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96dccb4e5ee5bd7905b219fc94182b6f","title":"italy matteo salvini joins steve bannon european populist group movement","story":"After a meeting in Rome, the Italian interior minister pledged his support to Bannon’s anti-European establishment MovementMatteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and populist leader, met Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon on Friday. After the meeting, which took place in Rome, Salvini officially joined the anti-European establishment group, the Movement, founded by Bannon.“He is in!’’ tweeted Mischaël Modrikamen, the Belgian politician and co-founder of the People’s party, who is also a member of Bannon’s group uniting Euroscepticand populist forces, posting a photo of Bannon and Salvini smiling in front of the camera.According to Italian media, Bannon has suggested the upcoming European elections in 2019 could open the way to new populist movements to fight the influence of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.The meeting on Friday follows a recent talk between Salvini and the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, another leader of European populism who shares an anti-migration stance.Following their meeting, on 28 August, Salvini and Orbán claimed they were “walking down the same path” after discussing the formation of a common anti-migration front to oppose the policies of Macron.Bannon is not new to European politics, being close to Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who has credited him with boosting the successful Brexit campaign. The former White House strategist, who is a Catholic with ties to conservatives in the Vatican, had already travelled to Rome back in March to support the far-right candidate Salvini before the Italian elections. Salvini, leader of the rightwing party the League, governs in coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.On Wednesday, Bannon met another far-right Italian leader in Venice: Giorgia Meloni, founder of the party Brothers of Italy, and close to Silvio Berlusconi and Salvini.“Italy has become a laboratory of European populism,’’ said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss School of Government in Rome.“The country risks moving away not only from Europe, but also from western democracies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/902b64c2d236ad008541e575fd2400c0d8b7c705/1327_1477_3704_2223/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a370e8eceeab6fbc2dee6370a8ced7c","title":"sandi toksvig reveals 60 qi pay gap from stephen fry","story":"BBC quiz host tells Women’s Equality party her pay is equal to panellist Alan DaviesThe QI presenter Sandi Toksvig has revealed she is paid less than half of what former host Stephen Fry received for fronting the popular BBC quiz show.The comedian, who also presents Channel 4’s The Great British Bake Off, was speaking to delegates at the Women’s Equality party conference on Saturday when she answered a question about her pay in an economics session.According to Mayer, the news was greeted with a “huge gasp” from the audience in Kettering. “People just did not know,” Mayer said. “Sandi has always been clear that this is not about her pay, but she had to answer the question given that the issue of equal pay is at the centre of our party’s policy.”Fry once claimed he was paid more to front the general knowledge quiz than the £245,000 Jeremy Paxman received for presenting University Challenge.Speaking after the event, Toksvig said: “I love QI and the brilliant team who produce it. John Lloyd and the team champion women on the show. I was asked a question at the Women’s Equality party conference that I felt I had to answer, because the issues with equal pay and the gender pay gap cut right across the media and all industries and all areas of life.“Until now I had held back from talking about this because this is not about me. However, the lack of transparency around pay is a big part of the problem and I hope that being open, I can support women across the country whose work is undervalued.”Toksvig has previously told the Radio Times: “If you are doing the same job it seems a bit absurd if you’re not paid the same.”The Danish-born writer has also argued, however, that her pay on the show is not an issue. In an interview on BBC 5 Live in October 2016 she said: “I wasn’t concerned about that because it is done through an agent and I am paid by an independent production company that makes the show, and not the BBC anyway.”Toksvig added that only women were asked about pay because they were generally the ones being underpaid. She said she suspected Miles Jupp would not have been asked if he was getting the same pay as her for taking over the hosting of the News Quiz, a job she did for BBC Radio 4 for 23 years.Earlier this year Toksvig was reported to have claimed she was paid more than her three co-stars on The Great British Bake Off, despite Paul Hollywood’s alleged £1.2m contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b94b94e4f47864a4fe5b5bd6425feed9aad1178/0_241_3487_2094/master/3487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dac974a2f13967bb26dd879d097a2ae","title":"the us midterm elections are set to be the year of the woman","story":"New analysis by NBC News predicts more than 100 women may be elected.

Remember when Johnnie Walker switched its name to Jane Walker earlier this year? Well, Harvey Nichols decided to nick their idea and are rebranding as Holly Nichols for September. Because, feminism. Not only is this stunt derivative but it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Harvey Nichols was co-founded Anne Harvey and James Nichols. So the rebrand to Holly Nichols erases a real woman from the store’s history and replaces her with a fictional woman.

(Photograph: Dee CumminsFacebook) A 93-year-old woman was left waiting on a chair for 25 hours in the emergency department of a Dublin hospital. Gladys Cummins went to the Mater University Hospital’s emergency department on Monday afternoon. She was in a nursing home in April and had been living independently up until recently. Ms Cummins daughter Dee Cummins said she and her two siblings waited with their mother while she was the emergency department, as they did not feel it was safe to leave her alone. “My mother went into A\u0026ampE at 2.15pm. She was left in a chair for 25 hours. She was moved from a wheelchair to the chair and back onto a wheelchair again, as she’s not mobile,” she told RTÉ Radio One. “We wrapped blankets around her because she was in a corridor and there was a draught. Every time the paramedics came in there was a draught.”“She doesn’t have dementia but at that time she was in and out of lucidity. She was fretting over the fact she wanted to get home, saying ‘why am I here?’. It was tough to calm her. We couldn’t leave her,” she said. Ms Cummins said there were several elderly people there. She took a photograph of her mother in the chair and put it on Facebook.“I felt people needed to see this. We talk a lot, between housing and healthcare, but nobody does anything. Rather than be a procrastinator and do nothing, I got up and took a photograph, put in on Facebook and asked people to share it. “I thought of a Facebook page called the Long Wait. People can put photos of their relatives on this page and the amount of time they spent waiting to see a medic,” she said. She said she received many responses from people who have had a similar situation with an elderly relative or loved one after posting the photo. “One girl told me her father died in a corridor in A\u0026ampE and she screamed for him to get some dignity. There are hundreds of thousands of similar stories. The Government is not up to the job obviously. It’s not just Simon Harris. We have a Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, in control of the purse. It’s about them all,” she said.“I think it’s bureaucracy...The money is going into administration costs more than the feet on the ground in the hospital. My mother was in a newly built A\u0026ampE. It’s not big enough. They are still sitting on chairs in corridors,” she said. Ms Cummins said her mother was receiving treatment on the geriatric ward and was currently waiting on results.

Photograph: Take Back the City – WaterfordFacebook Housing activists inspired by protests in Dublin have occupied an empty building in Waterford city centre.The Waterford protesters, who are local supporters of the Take Back the City movement, said they want the council to build social housing on land banks around the edge of the city and to compulsorily purchase what they say are thousands of vacant properties in the area. They are also calling for rent caps to be linked to inflation.A local People Before Profit representative, Una Dunphy, said she supported the protest. Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy “said Waterford would build 687 new social houses between now and 2021. This is a ridiculously low number, but even so only 11 social houses were built last year. There are over 3,000 on the housing list in Waterford, and there are over 110 people homeless in Waterford at present.”She told reporters the activists had chosen the former presbytery, which the council leases from the diocese of Waterford and Lismore, because “it’s city centre, it’s huge, it’s an old building with a preservation order on it, and it’s owned by the council. For that reason we feel it’s something they could act on immediately. It’s nobody’s private property. It’s owned by us. When we think of apartments in the city centre – I’ve lived in them myself – they’re tiny little shoeboxes. This is a huge building that has big huge rooms, and it could be a fantastic apartment block.”After meeting the Waterford protesters, who include housing activists, trade unionists and students, the Garda and council said they could stay in the building until 11.30am on Saturday. They have been told not to go beyond the ground floor, where arts workshops have occasionally been held, because of safety risks on upper floors.

Give a 16-year-old a job packing shelves in Tesco, you make sure he can pack shelves.”The only things Mr Quinn and others in central Belfast were sure of was that British prime minister Theresa May had blundered in appointing Bradley and that Bradley had blundered in admitting her obliviousness.In an interview with House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament, Ms Bradley said that when appointed Northern Ireland secretary in January she did not know nationalists did not vote for unionists and that unionists did not vote for nationalists.“I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland,” she said. “I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa.”The former culture secretary also admitted being “slightly scared” of a place that has enjoyed relative peace and stability since the 1998 Belfast Agreement.A Downing Street spokesperson said Ms May retained confidence in Ms Bradley and that the minister was “working incredibly hard” to restore devolved government. The Irish Government, too, called her a smart and experienced politician.But Sinn Féin’s former Stormont finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said Ms Bradley’s comments were a “sorry reminder” of where the country was on the priority list of the British government.People in Belfast, nationalist and unionist, expressed astonishment that Ms Bradley was put in charge at an exceptionally sensitive time, with Brexit and the breakdown in Stormont’s power-sharing government putting the Belfast Agreement under strain.“It’s ridiculous that she could know nothing about it and still get the job. Usually you have to show knowledge to get a job. I did,” said Leona Orr (24) a child care worker from Clogher Valley.Henry McCarthy (76) a retired community worker, said: “I was absolutely horrified that she could be in a position where she was so terribly ignorant of a situation in which so many people were killed, it just baffles me.”Among those who died in the Troubles was Airey Neave, a Tory MP blown up by a republican terrorist bomb at Westminster in 1979, yet Ms Bradley had risen through the party ranks with no clue about Northern Ireland, said Mr McCarthy. “To come here without even primitive knowledge reflects very badly on the prime minister and the Conservative party.”Stephanie Lyons (41) a civil servant, said she was not surprised. “A lot of English people don’t know how things are here. But you would expect more from a politician,” she said.Tom Neill (72) a former soldier, echoed a widespread view that Ms Bradley’s comments showed indifference to Northern Ireland. “The government in Westminster doesn’t give a damn about us.”Several of those interviewed confessed their own ignorance about Bradley - they had no idea who she was until hearing about her startlingly frank interview. “Not heard of her till today, to be honest,” said Michael Reynolds (73) a retired driving instructor.This week the Northern Ireland secretary had won some plaudits for slashing the pay of members of the paralysed Stormont assembly, a long overdue move, according to many voters.In the interview with House magazine Ms Bradley (47) said of Northern Ireland’s partisan politics: “That’s a very different world from the world I came from where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative.“That is so incredibly different and it’s when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”The Troubles had shaped her view of Northern Ireland and she had no idea how wonderful and vibrant the region was, she said. “I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today,” she said.Several shoppers on Castle Street wondered if there was calculation, a hidden tactic, behind her apparent naivety. “Politicians are trained to lie,” said Johns Gibbs. “Maybe it’s like, ‘I’m stupid, forgive me’.”–"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3622094.1536358199!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just build houses professor tells government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Tony Fahey said homelessness is ‘a very small part of the total picture’. Photograph: Frank Miller  A leading social policy analyst has said up to 30,000 houses need to be built annually to tackle the housing crisis and his message to Government and local authorities is: “Just do it.”UCD professor of social policy Tony Fahey said there is no reason the Government and local authorities cannot press ahead with social housing developments once they ensure work is done in parallel to ensure all important services, such as schools and policing, will be put in place.An apparent focus by Government and some local authorities on seeking that new social housing developments be “mixed-tenure” or not exclusively local authority tenants may be contributing to delays in building, he said.The objections to 100 per cent local authority estates are “completely overdone”, he said. “The concern with mixed tenure is an obstacle to getting the job done and it’s hard to understand where it comes from.”Many well-established developments in Dublin such as Cabra, Drimnagh and Donnycarney started life as local authority estates but became mixed tenure for reasons including tenants buying out their houses and private developers building in those areas as they prospered, he pointed out.Prof Fahey was speaking after Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy had criticised the failure of some local authorities to put in place family hubs as emergency accommodation for the homeless in preference to hotels. The Minister has threatened to use emergency powers to transfer responsibility for emergency accommodation to his own department.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told RTÉ on Friday there was “no quick fix” to the housing crisis and denied the Government was seeking to put the blame on the local authorities.Prof Fahey said homelessness is “a very small part of the total picture” in a context where nearly 10,000 people are homeless and the Economic and Social Research Institute has said 25,000-30,000 houses need to be provided annually to house those on housing waiting lists.A wide range of possibilities are open to address the crisis, including a return to the large scale housing programmes of the 1930s and 1960s, from which places like Cabra emerged, he said. The Government could direct local authorities to launch a “new wave” of local authority housing and it was up to central government to provide funding for that.Local authorities had built or funded the building of 300,000 housing units in the past and while there was criticism of some developments such as Ballymun, he considered the criticism was “unbalanced” and ignored the achievements.Local authorities had two roles in relation to social housing for most of the 20th century, he said. They provided and managed rental housing, much of which they would have commissioned private developers to build and also provided low-cost loans.After the mid-1980s recession, governments essentially cut off the supply of funding for such loans but the Government’s announcement of a new scheme of lending for home purchase for certain low-income limits was the first indication of a possible return to that earlier function of local authorities.Michael Walsh, chair of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) Housing Committee, said local authorities are at the forefront in addressing the “very challenging” issues faced on housing.“We are absolutely committed to meeting the targets set out for us by Government,” he said.The Rebuilding Ireland strategy sets annual targets for the build, acquisition and leasing of new social housing stock, which have been met each year, Mr Walsh said.The targets for this year, and subsequent years, continue to increase as local authorities accelerate their building programmes, he said.Local authorities are also pleased to facilitate and collaborate with approved housing bodies to deliver new social housing, he added.

Like the doctors who put General Francisco Franco through needless torment for weeks before his death in November 1975, Theresa May’s ministers will stop at nothing to keep her Chequers plan for Brexit alive.\u0026nbspThe Spanish doctors were terrified that the dictator would reap his fiery reward before his courtiers had every detail in place for an orderly succession. For weeks TV news bulletins around the world reported nightly that Franco was not yet dead, inspiring Saturday Night Live’s regular update later confirming that he was still dead.Throughout the summer Conservative Brexiteers have been telling the prime minister that Chequers is as dead as Franco, a diagnosis confirmed this week by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.“Les propositions sont mortes,” he told a group of MPs this week, according to Labour’s Stephen Kinnock.The prime minister and her allies insist that Chequers remains a negotiable proposal, pointing out that the EU has not rejected it. It is true that although Barnier has rubbished two of its central elements – single market access for goods and a complicated, dual-tariff customs arrangement – the EU has not yet issued the death certificate. May is confident that, when EU leaders meet in Salzburg, Austria, on September 20th, they will continue to be polite about her proposal even if they restate their commitment to the principles that make it unacceptable.The Brexiteers, who flirted for a while with a no-deal Brexit (even attempting to rebrand it as “WTO rules”), have for the most part woken up to the fact that leaving the EU next March without a transition period would be catastrophic.This shift has been driven partly by the return to the back benches of Steve Baker, long an organising force behind the Brexiteers who as Brexit minister was responsible for no-deal planning. It has been encouraged by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been “trying to keep the crazies in line”, according to one source.Rees-Mogg was among the MPs who met Barnier in Brussels this week, and he claimed afterwards that they agreed that the best option consistent with Britain’s red lines was a Canada-style free trade agreement. When Brexit secretary Dominic Raab appeared before the EU scrutiny committee on Wednesday, a number of Brexiteers asked him why the government didn’t abandon Chequers in favour of Canada.One argument Raab made against Canada was that it would not solve the issue of the Border, and would consign Northern Ireland to an indefinite limbo under the terms of a backstop.Richard Drax, a former officer in the Coldstream Guards who represents South Dorset, told Raab that the issue of Northern Ireland had been blown out of all proportion.“Having served out there on three tours, I can tell you that if the Irish Government started to put up some sort of restrictions on the Border there would be an outcry, not just from the North but also from the South. It just wouldn’t happen,” he said.Drax, whose full name is the quadruple-barrelled\u0026nbspRichard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, is the great-nephew of the Irish writer Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany, who was part of the Irish literary revival in the early 20th century. Dunsany achieved worldwide success with stories and plays set in a fantasy world, and Drax may be engaging in magical thinking when he suggests that the issue of the Border can be ignored.Britain has rejected the EU’s draft protocol on the backstop but its negotiators have shown no sign that they are ready to propose an alternative text.Barnier, however, has sought to “de-dramatise” the issue, stressing that the EU is simply seeking to build on existing checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for animal and plant hygiene, for example. To this end he has asked Britain for details of how such checks are conducted today.He has also indicated that the EU is willing to change the language of the protocol, which currently includes two phrases that are particularly toxic for unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea. The first refers to the creation of a “common regulatory area” on the island of Ireland, and the second states that “the territory of Northern Ireland...shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union”.The joint report agreed between Britain and the EU last December called only for full alignment “with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement”.In recent weeks Barnier has referred to a limited number of EU rules continuing to apply to Northern Ireland, a shift that could reassure unionists that the backstop does not undermine the UK’s constitutional order.\u0026nbspRegulatory checks could be conducted at British ports only and not in Northern Ireland because the EU is only concerned with goods travelling from east to west. Northern Ireland’s traders would continue to have frictionless access to the rest of the UK as well as to the rest of the island of Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyFor me, I think that quote may be the equivalent of the death blow in Kill Bill. Do you know the one? You get hit just with fingertips, “and then he lets you walk away. But once you’ve taken five steps, your heart explodes in your body, and you fall to the floor, dead.” So with the Northern Ireland secretary’s hot take on Northern Ireland. My mechanism might be shot for good after reading it. I may well be typing my last five steps here.Clearly, it is not simply the initial imbecility of having no clue about the central facts of Northern Irish politics and history, even though you were 28 (twenty-eight) when the Belfast Agreement was signed. It is also the second imbecility of thinking you should ever mention that in public, much less as delightedly, as Karen did. “It’s when you realise that,” burbled the secretary of state, “that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”Ideally, you would start understanding these things some decades before you were the cabinet minister with operational responsibility for arguably the most sensitive region of the United Kingdom. Instead, Karen’s breezy My Learning Curve speech casts high office as a remedial scheme for the unreachable outliers of Family Fortunes survey respondents. “We asked 100 people what they imagined were the Ladybird-level facts about Northern Ireland.”Karen’s answer is the type of WTF-ery that allows even Vernon Kay (Vernon Kay) to mug to camera with the practised eyebrow-raise that says: Where do they find these quarterwits? It was previously thought that any challenge to Andrea Leadsom’s position as stupidest Downing Street minister would have to hail from the mineral or at least vegetable kingdoms. But this is quite sensational from Karen. Theresa May’s decision to appoint her to this government of all the talentless underscores exactly where the UK stands. If you hadn’t already swallowed the red pill, you may safely consider Karen’s interview as your dose. No going back now. The answer to the question “How low is the bar?” is: the bar is in another hemisphere. The bar is orbiting Jupiter. There is no bar.Darker portents attend Karen’s predecessor as the British cabinet minster most wantonly and insouciantly unsuited to their job. It’s been a mixed week for Boris Johnson. On the downside for us, Boris has been explicitly backed for the leadership by the cruelly miscast kingmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg. On the upside, Johnson’s statement announcing his orce from his wife, Marina Wheeler, tees up a series of malarial Love Actually plot lines for when he later – or sooner – gets the keys to 10 Downing Street. (And if you’re still doubting the heart-exploding inevitability of that scenario, you must have been watching the global upsets of the past two years on tape delay. Everything that can go wrong does. Buy shares in distilleries today.)As for the coveted endorsement from someone Boris would unquestionably have pitied mercilessly at school (they missed being Eton contemporaries by a year), it came in a radio interview on LBC. “Two years ago, in the Conservative Party leadership campaign, I supported Boris Johnson, because I thought he would deliver Brexit extraordinarily well,” Rees-Mogg intoned, suggesting he has inherited all his father’s gifts of prophecy. “I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to change my mind on that.” Not anything?! Should have gone to MonocleSavers.Yet Boris is undeniably back. He has never been more back. Perhaps the most striking feature of the immediate period is how people decisively written off as wrong’uns in the very recent past are emerging again as comparatively attractive prospects. Two years ago, Michael Gove had been deservedly downgraded to a mere Brutus emoji now he’s apparently a leadership contender once more.Perhaps the preposterous inadequates of the past do all seem like elder statespeople now. Others appear so inspired by their accelerated rehabilitation that they are trying to pull off something similar instantly. Take David Davis, who announced this week that he would attend a Leave Means Leave rally in Bolton “as a matter of principle, to ensure Brexit is delivered”.What can you say? Until about 10 minutes ago, David had spent two years as the cabinet minister literally in charge of delivering it. This is like setting fire to a building, running away, then standing outside telling the emergency services how you’d be handling the rescue differently.Expect plenty more auditions for the role of Captain Hindsight in the weeks and months ahead.

But these are the newly “restored” 15th and 16th century wooden carvings of an Asturias church, following the intervention of a well-meaning parishioner.Church authorities have been sent to survey the damage after the resident in the village of Rañadoiro was given permission to take the carvings home for a revamp, resulting in what specialists have called “an absolute disaster”. A figure of the Virgin Mary - previously in a plain wooden finish - now sports a shocking pink robe, the Infant Jesus in her arms dressed in garish green.In another carving, the mother of Christ has been turned from brunette to platinum blonde, her clothes updated to a soft rose hue in a makeover that has drawn comparisons to Barbie.The government of the autonomous community in northern Spain said Friday it had opened an investigation into why the parishioner was allowed to undertake the restoration works despite having no experience.The carvings have been given a major revampGenaro Alonso, the Asturias education and culture counsellor, expressed his “obvious displeasure” at what he described as a “mess”.The parishioner responsible, named by the Asturias paper El Comercio as María Luisa Menéndez, has defended her efforts, insisting the villagers had been pleased with the results.“I am not a professional, simply the figures were horrifying and I wanted to paint them to make them better,” Ms Menéndez, who runs a local news stand, told El Comercio.Another parishioner, who lent his support to Ms Menéndez, said she spent more than a year working on them as she had to give them “several coats”. The figures before their makeoverLuis Suárez Saro, the expert who undertook the last professional restoration of the carvings in 2003, lamented that they had “an enormous historical and artistic value” and were now covered in “a modern paint, of the kind used to paint houses or furniture”. Mr Suárez said it was unclear whether the figures would be able to be salvaged, especially as two of them already had paint finished.The 20th century Ecce Homo style fresco of Christ before and after restoration It is not the first time that amateur restoration works have raised eyebrows in Spain.In 2012, Cecilia Giménez, an octogenarian resident of the Aragonese town of Borja, shot to international infamy with her attempt to restore a 100-year-old fresco of Jesus.The incident, and the inadvertent boon for the town’s fortunes as thousands of tourists flocked to see the botched work, has since been made into a comic opera. Please review our commenting policyWar catches up with thousands of Syrians who fled to Idlib for safetyFrench actor Gerard Depardieu spotted in North Korea ahead of regime\u0026#39s 70th anniversaryEgyptian court sentences photographer to jail and hands down 75 death sentences Divided EU could thwart British push for new sanctions on Russia over Skripal attackUS recalls top envoys to Panama, El Salvador and Dominican Republic over TaiwanWoman wielding a knife heard shouting \u0026#39kill\u0026#39 during  \u0026#39serious incident\u0026#39 in Barnsley 12 dead in Basra as rockets fired at airport and Iranian consulate torchedComment: Whether it\u0026#39s Titian or the TV, we\u0026#39re uncomfortable, but mesmerised by sexMother, father and child survive dramatic fall onto tube tracks at Baker Street Chuka Umunna tells Jeremy Corbyn to \u0026#39call off the dogs\u0026#39 to stop centre-left MPs being driven out of LabourAretha Franklin’s stage dresses and accessories to be sold at November auction in New YorkNHS heart test is a \u0026#39poorly executed gimmick\u0026#39 that will frighten millions, warns health advisorComment: Think Karen Bradley knows nothing about Northern Ireland?

Washington is Taipei’s main arms supplier and most vocal international backer. Please review our commenting policyWar catches up with thousands of Syrians who fled to Idlib for safetyFrench actor Gerard Depardieu spotted in North Korea ahead of regime\u0026#39s 70th anniversaryEgyptian court sentences photographer to jail and hands down 75 death sentences Divided EU could thwart British push for new sanctions on Russia over Skripal attackPolice responding to \u0026#39serious incident\u0026#39 in Barnsley amid reports of several stabbings12 dead in Basra as rockets fired at airport and Iranian consulate torchedComment: Whether it\u0026#39s Titian or the TV, we\u0026#39re uncomfortable, but mesmerised by sexMother, father and child survive dramatic fall onto tube tracks at Baker Street Chuka Umunna tells Jeremy Corbyn to \u0026#39call off the dogs\u0026#39 to stop centre-left MPs being driven out of LabourAretha Franklin’s stage dresses and accessories to be sold at November auction in New YorkNHS heart test is a \u0026#39poorly executed gimmick\u0026#39 that will frighten millions, warns health advisorComment: Think Karen Bradley knows nothing about Northern Ireland?

Supply was random and the monthly comics would appear in uncertain quantities, and you could never guarantee that your newsagent would get the following month’s Uncanny X-Men, or even that they would get in any American comics at all.And that led to the rise of what is known as direct market, which saw distributors ship brand new comics in the week that they were published straight to a new breed of specialist comic shops that began to spring up around the UK.Today, most towns have a specialist comic shop which works on this model, but one of the most venerable and successful brands is Forbidden Planet, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary and enjoying a position at the top of the market for not only monthly comics but the ever-growing world of geek culture that takes in action figures, toys and collectible movie merchandise.Forbidden Planet is just a shop, albeit a long-running and successful one. But it also occupies a position in the hearts of many consumers of popular culture, both long-standing ones who remember the days when access to comics was not as easy as it is now, and younger fans who have grown up with easy access to the plentiful products of geek culture.“I think I discovered Forbidden Planet, much like everyone else, through those marvellous Brian Bolland ads on the London Tube,” says author, comics writer, and all-round geek culture god figure Neil Gaiman. The ads in question are iconic Brian Bolland is one of the most talented and much-loved British comics artists, who back in the late 1970s was a star of British sci-fi weekly comic 2000AD and his ads for Forbidden Planet, which ended up adorning a million carrier bags, featured a coterie of grotesque characters and the now-famous legend, “People like us shop at Forbidden Planet”.Back when Forbidden Planet had first opened and was in the first few years of finding its feet, Gaiman was years away from making his name as the writer of the long-running comics series The Sandman, his novels American Gods and Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett), much less the TV adaptations of those works. How important was finding this oasis of geek culture to him back then?“I’m not sure I would have survived as a young journalist without Forbidden Planet,” he acknowledges.In those far off, pre-internet days, it was a lot more difficult for fans of geek culture to find each other. You might have been\u0026nbspthe only person in your entire school who read comics. Finding your way to a shop like Forbidden Planet was opening up a world of other people like yourself.As venerable as Forbidden Planet might be, it wasn’t quite the first comics shop in the country. People speak very fondly of a shining light in London’s geek scene in the shape of Dark They Were, And Golden-Eyed (where Forbidden Planet takes its name from the 1956 science fiction classic movie starring Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis, the forerunner shop borrowed its name from a 1949 short story by Ray Bradbury).Dark They Were, And Golden-Eyed shone brightly for a short time located on Soho’s Berwick Street from the late 1960s. Gaiman vividly remembers bunking off school to head into its dark recesses to discover the latest science fiction books. Plenty of people who became luminaries in the science fiction and comics fields hung out there, from the aforementioned Bolland to Bryan Talbot to Alan Moore.But one regular customer in particular was to go on to shape the future of geek shopping in the UK. Nick Landau produced a comics fanzine and helped organise the earliest comic conventions in the UK, and in the late 1970s he spotted a gap in the market for the growing number of comics fans whose only access to the output of Marvel and DC was their local, haphazardly-stocked newsagents, while the comics put out by independent and underground publishers were practically unobtainable.With like-minded iniduals Mike Lake and Mike Luckman, Landau set up a company to import American comics and get them into the smattering of shops such as Dark They Were, And Golden-Eyed. When they decided to open their own shop in 1978 on Denmark Street, they christened it Forbidden Planet, and together with Dark They Were and the New Cross-situated Weird Fantasy, these were practically the first and only specialist comic and science fiction shops in London four decades ago.Another famous name who cut his teeth at Dark They Were is broadcaster and comics fan Jonathan Ross. When that shop closed in 1981, a lot of the custom gravitated towards the newcomer, Forbidden Planet.“Denmark Street was my favourite Forbidden Planet location,” recalls Ross. “With both Dark They Were and Forbidden Planet, I thought they were remarkable places when I was really young. They had all these comics, and not just the superhero ones, but all this European stuff that these shops allowed me to discover.”Gaiman agrees. “The fantastic thing about Forbidden Planet wasn’t books or comics or magazines but it was the number of intersections that were made … everybody went there and everything came through them. I’ve got friends I’ve had for 30 years who were made in Forbidden Planet, waiting in line to get someone to sign a book or comic.“It was where we found each other, we the geeks, we the few, we the people who loved this stuff and didn’t know if there was anyone else like us.”Most of the biggest names in science fiction and comics have passed through Forbidden Planet at some point, from Douglas Adams (1979) to Mark Hamill and David Prowse (1980) through Stan Lee (1987), Stephen King (1983), Game of Thrones author George RR Martin (2009) and science fiction grandmaster Arthur C Clarke (1986).The shop proved so popular in its early days that they had to open a second store, just round the corner on St Giles Street. Further moves followed, first to New Oxford Street and then to the first Forbidden Planet Megastore on Shaftesbury Avenue, which remains its flagship store today.But more expansion was to come, as with the turn of the millennium geek culture exploded into the mainstream. New Forbidden Planets sprung up, in Birmingham and Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle.Confusingly, there are actually two companies called Forbidden Planet now, dating back to 1992. Mike Luckman went to New York to open a Forbidden Planet store, while Mike Lake set up a series of Forbidden Planet shops mainly in Scotland and the north of England, trading as Forbidden Planet International. Landau set up the Titan Entertainment Group in 1993, which today runs the Forbidden Planet chain, as well as a major book and comic publishing arm. But they all have their origins in the Denmark Street shop which opened in 1978.“I suppose Forbidden Planet today is more of a pop culture destination that the comic shop it started as,” says Ross. “The big store in Covent Garden doesn’t have that feel of a 1970s comic shop anymore, but it’s an amazing place. I go there fairly regularly and they save my comics for me every month.”​Beano launches new comic strip to support childrens’ mental healthTrailer for Matt Groening\u0027s new Netflix series DisenchantmentGaiman adds:\u0026nbsp“We live in a weird period of geek culture, especially for those of us who grew up with it in the 1970s and 1980s. For a long time I would talk to people in Hollywood and they would tell me that people didn’t like to see science fiction and fantasy in the cinema or on their TVs. What’s lovely to see now is the generation that has come up, those who grew up discovering shops like Forbidden Planet, who are now making the decisions in TV and movies, and they’re the sort of people who can see that isn’t true, that people do love science fiction and fantasy.”Forbidden Planet is now no longer the only specialist geek shop in the country, not by a long way. But it’s probably fair to say that because of the hard work put in to make it a success 40 years ago, there wouldn’t be comic shops in most towns, HMV wouldn’t be selling rows and rows of Funko Pop! Vinyl bobblehead geek figurines, and WHSmith wouldn’t have piles of discounted books about the Marvel Universe or Game of Thrones.And there’s another important change that’s taken place as well, and that’s the clientele. Back when Brian Bolland did his first ads for Forbidden Planet, the “people like us” who shopped there according to his illustrations were outsiders, just like geeks were at the time. And something else as well. Gaiman says:\u0026nbsp“Yes, we were mainly male and mainly in our early twenties. But I absolutely love the fact that this has changed over the years and now it is absolutely no longer true of the fans.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesThe poppy sculpture Wave by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper at IWM North, The Quays, Manchester.

The Prime Minister is on a two-day visit to Northern Ireland. During her visit, focusing on Brexit and the deadlock at Stormont, she will visit the Irish border and discuss the potential impact of Brexit with Northern Irish businessesAgain, however, when we get down to concrete policies, there is little to shock. Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/19/ec.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/19/ec.jpg","title":"brexit chequers plan britain eu latest updates uk negotiation","story":"Created with Sketch.Brexiteers and Remainers alike seized on the admissionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May is wedded to the planBrexit: Chequers plan gives no competitive advantage to Britain over EU, UK negotiators admit British negotiators have openly admitted in Brussels that Theresa May’s Chequers deal will not deliver any competitive advantage to the UK over Europe after Brexit.UK officials are making the claim to their EU counterparts in a bid to sell the under-fire plan to Brussels – but news of the admission has enraged Tory Brexiteers who already view Chequers as a sell-out.Anti-Brexit campaigners also seized on the news – saying it raised questions about “what on Earth”\u0026nbspthe point of leaving the EU actually was.It comes as chancellor Philip Hammond admitted that there may be further austerity cuts if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal.British negotiators are arguing that a mix of UK commitments to include “non-regression” clauses on EU standards and a commitment to sign up to state aid “level playing field” rules will mean British businesses cannot unfairly undercut EU firms on services.The UK wants to sign up to a common rulebook of EU regulations for goods – which would tie it into European standards for physical exports\u0026nbsp – but exit the rest of the single market for services.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has rejected the Chequers plan – partly on the basis that he believes the UK proposal to sign up to only some single market rules would give it a competitive advantage. But counter-intuitively, the UK is arguing that this would not be the case.UK officials familiar with the British negotiating position say there is already huge flexibility within the EU on service regulations and that the UK will not get an unfair advantage compared to European firms.\u0026nbspThis is an admission of what those of us who are against Chequers already know – it’s a bad deal for the UK.They are also arguing that because UK businesses selling services into the EU will have to follow the regulations of that country anyway there would be no way to undercut European businesses trading there.\u0026nbspOfficials have also admitted that where services are covered by single market rules, firms actually tend to gain an advantage from being part of those rules because it allows them to sell into other countries – meaning the UK might actually lose out from not being in the single market.Remainers and Brexiteers alike said the news showed Chequers would be a failure – though they suggested different resolutions.Eurosceptic Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “This is an admission of what those of us who are against Chequers already know – it’s a bad deal for the UK.“It shackles us to the EU as a captive market, a vassal state.“It serves a key purpose for the EU – other countries will look at this and say well if the UK, with the size of its economy, can’t get any sort of advantage from leaving the EU then no one can.”Labour MP Owen Smith, a supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “If the Chequers Deal offers no advantages for Britain, what on Earth is the point of pursuing it?\u0026nbsp“This is just the latest revelation that even those negotiating the Brexit deal know that a soft Brexit offers no upsides, while a hard Brexit is a pure disaster.”Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab travelled to Brussels on Thursday to meet with his counterpart Mr Barnier, though the pair made no public appearances or statements.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU. I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission. Europe needs a new beginning and more democracy.”AFPGetty)In recent months Mr Weber has taken a tough rhetorical line on immigration and migration, in an apparent bid to position himself for the role. In January he was forced to apologise for a comment in which he called for a “final solution to the refugee question”.

I’m kind of hoping they’re not right.”Lord Blunkett, a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair’s administration, said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.Asked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer said: “It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn’t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.”But Mr Blair’s intervention sparked a backlash from Mr Corbyn’s supporters, with MP\u0026nbspChris Williamson\u0026nbspsaying he did not understand Mr Blair’s argument, given the huge support Mr Corbyn enjoyed in the party membership.He said: “The Labour Party has never been more united.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/xi-jinping-china-africa.jpg","title":"china africa bejing forum investment interest free loans","story":"Created with Sketch.China\u0027s Xi Jinping\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspinvestment comes with \u0027no political strings attached\u0027Click to followThe IndependentChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, with South Africa\u0027s Cyril Ramaphosa, centre left, and other leaders behind, attend the 2018 Beijing FOCAC summitRepresentatives from\u0026nbspalmost every country in Africa dined with Xi Jinping on Monday night as they attended what is believed to be the largest gathering of African heads of state ever staged\u0026nbspoutside the continent.They had plenty to toast, after China’s President Xi pledged new infrastructure investments in their countries of $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) ning the next three years.The latest investment\u0026nbspis in addition to the $60bn\u0026nbsppledged back in\u0026nbsp2015, and promises to continue the remarkable growth of China-backed building projects across the African segment, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.China now far outstrips the economic clout and engagement in Africa of either the US or Europe, and its involvement has inevitably sparked criticism.Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned against what he called a “new version of colonialism” last month when he cancelled a $20bn Chinese-backed rail project.And in his speech addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi appeared to acknowledge these concerns, saying Chinese investment came with “no political strings attached”.“China does not interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa,” he said. “More than 1.3 billion Chinese people and more than 1.2 million African people have always pursued a shared future.“We respect Africa, love Africa and support Africa.”Since Mr Xi’s announcement, African heads of state have similarly sought to play down any suggestion that China’s interests are in anything other than mutual economic growth.Zimbabwe’s newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hit out at critics of China in an interview on state TV.“There is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, said the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing was working towards “a vision that has been crafted in Africa, by Africans… of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa”.May overlooked a vast humanitarian crisis on her Africa tourNever mind Brexit, the South Africans will love us after May’s dancingTheresa May’s visit to Robben Island is insultingThe UK securing trade deals in Africa doesn’t make much senseMay makes ‘unashamed’ vow to use aid to boost UK firms in Africa“FOCAC refutes the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he added.Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the current African Union chairman and a fierce critic in the past of foreign aid, said he considered China to be a “more respectful partner” than either Europe or America.“The relationship between Africa and China is based on equality, mutual respect and a commitment to a shared well-being,” he said. “Our growing ties with China do not come at anyone’s expense.”Some experts are not so sure. The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/13/Gaza-Palestine-fuel-Israel.jpg  width= 2221  height= 1666  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/13/Gaza-Palestine-fuel-Israel.jpg","title":"israel embassy paraguay jerusalem tel aviv netanyahu","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Israel views very seriously Paraguay’s exceptional decision which will strain the relations between the countries,\u0027 says office of\u0026nbspPrime Minister Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahuClick to followThe IndependentIsrael hits back at Paraguay after it moves embassy back to Tel Aviv from JerusalemIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the closure of his country\u0027s\u0026nbspembassy in Paraguay in response to a\u0026nbspdecision by the South American nation to move\u0026nbspits own embassy back to Tel Aviv from JerusalemThe decision by newly-elected President Mario\u0026nbspAbdocomes\u0026nbspcomes\u0026nbspjust months after his\u0026nbsppredecessor, former President Horacio Cartes, opened the embassy in Jerusalem in May.\u0026nbspThe city of Jerusalem has been a fundamental issue in tensions between\u0026nbspIsrael and the Palestinian, and the latest moves will be a set-back to Mr Netanyahu.Donald Trump controversially broke from decades of American policy, when he announced a new US policy last year that recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required. Some publishers, it seems, have more freedom than others.Facebook’s two-faced bosses should be brought to book for their double standards on privacy and their blatant disregard for the public good.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party?

Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed?

But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls. And nobody talks to anybody any more. We discuss banning the burka from public spaces.But is there anything more antisocial than someone with their head down, oblivious to the world around them?ANNOYED that her partner had allegedly cheated on her, Serena Reynoldson filmed herself pouring bleach into his tropical fish tank while cackling, “Die, die, die!” Which is what they did, of course.I think her ex, Jon Fitzpatrick, is well out of it, frankly.It all seems a bit hard on the poor fish. So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves. A Tasmanian devil, say, or a king cobra.WHY has Jose Mourinho not been sacked by Manchester United?I don’t mean because his team are not terribly good. Or about as pleasing to watch as John Prescott eating a curry.But he’s just been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and hit with whopping fines – for tax evasion running into the millions of pounds.Does Manchester United not have any principles?I’LL be glued to the box watching The Mighty Redcar on BBC2 tonight. Seeing that the town is only a stone’s throw from my gaff in Saltburn.I was worried at first that it was just another poverty-porn film.You know, when the BBC turns up somewhere north of Watford so everyone can have a good old snigger at the people who live there.But having spoken to some of the people who took part, it isn’t like that at all.Redcar’s had it rough and wages are low. Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The richest one per cent pay 27 per cent of all income tax, as opposed to just 11 under Labour in the 1970s. Raising the top rate nets LESS money since the wealthiest find ways to avoid it, or leave.Low corporation tax is partly behind the incredible job creation since 2010. Reverse it and see the dole queues grow.And an avalanche of taxes on wealth won’t bring equality. The overall burden is near a 30-year high. Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments.

It’s far more likely to persuade them to pick a healthier option too.The problem is enforcing it. We don’t want council “calorie cops” giving firms a hard time.

The stitch-up reeked.When MEPs found out, even the European parliament was appalled.The improper manoeuvre will keep Selmayr, a devout federalist, at the centre of power for years to come and long after his patron Jean-Claude Juncker has retired to spend more time with his wine cellar.How did they pull it off?The outgoing secretary-general had told Juncker, privately, he would retire this year.Armed with Juncker’s inside knowledge, Selmayr successfully applied to be deputy.Then, at a meeting of commissioners, Juncker revealed the secretary-general post was suddenly vacant and that, as luck would have it, Selmayr was ready to fill it.The ombudsman’s conclusions on what the pair did are scathing. Four serious breaches of protocol and maladministration are listed.Selmayr did not take appropriate measures to avoid conflict of interest. The rules of procedure were broken.“A situation of urgency to fill the post of secretary-general was created artificially,” O’Reilly says, and: “The commissioners  responsible for the maladministration in this case. It is extraordinary that no commissioner seemed to question the secretary-general appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Extraordinary is putting it mildly.The report makes for shocking, if not surprising, reading. The rules-based Brussels order and its highly paid apparat behave like a gangster racket.Just to be helpful, I’m going to send a copy of O’Reilly’s report to every EU flag-waving “People’s Vote” campaigner and to Gary Lineker, the crisp- toting TV football host, who has emerged as a leading voice in the campaign for a second referendum.Needless to say, Selmayr and Juncker face no sanctions or punishment.Instead, O’Reilly recommends that the commission should develop a new procedure — I’m sure that will help — for appointing the next secretary-general.My first thought on reading her report was that the commission is an even more appalling and arrogant organisation than it looks, sitting at the heart of an imperious EU wedded to ever-closer integration.Thank goodness we’re leaving. But are we?To listen to the hysterical wailing of the People’s Vote crowd in recent weeks, you would think that Brexit is about to be stopped and a grateful public will beg to be bossed around by Selmayr and his goons for years to come.There isn’t the parliamentary time for another referendum before we leave on March 29 and it’s an exceptionally duff idea regardless.If there can be two referendums, why leave it at that? Why not make it best of three or five? The decision to leave has been taken. Britain is quitting the EU.Thank goodness, in my view a shame, in the view of others — what matters now are the terms.Here, the Tory party is engaged in a row with itself over the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal, which envisages Britain sticking with the EU’s rule book on goods.It is astonishing to see how purist this has made some of my fellow-Brexiteers who spent years before the referendum acknowledging in private that there would have to be compromises.Not long ago, Boris Johnson was so torn by the nuanced arguments on either side that he plumped for Leave by the narrowest of margins. Now he plays the zealot.But contrary to the prophets of doom, the Chequers proposal isn’t dead yet.No10 is adamant that it has “unlocked the talks” and that, beneath the rhetoric of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, progress is being made that may become apparent at the Salzburg meeting of EU leaders on September 20.In a weird way it might work. With Theresa May’s internal critics split and producing almost as many alternative Brexit plans as there are Tory MPs, Labour divided, and other EU member states anxious that we don’t leave without a deal, something like the Chequers plan remains the best one on offer.It would satisfy non-obsessives like me to just agree a deal, improve it as we go along, and get on with life beyond Brexit. Life is full of compromises.This is sacrilege to my purist friends. But soon, hardline Conservative MPs must decide whether they care so much about ideology that they are prepared to vote down an imperfect deal.If they do that, they risk losing the lot.And by opening the way to emergency extensions of our membership until we come up with another plan, they could condemn Britain to staying in the awful organisation that elevated Martin Selmayr to power.Times/News SyndicationOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Corbyn Britain would thus abandon our deterrent, whatever Labour’s manifesto says.Will they ever be honest enough to tell voters they would unilaterally disarm, just as the world gets more dangerous?Honesty, though, is not their strong suit.Yesterday McDonnell repeated the absurd lie that he only wanted “peace” in Northern Ireland. He and Corbyn wanted IRA victory, achieved through ­murder. McDonnell wanted Provos “honoured”. He praised them for bombing their way to the negotiating table.As for the anti-Semite Corbyn, how chuffed he must be that 40 per cent of Jews could flee Britain if he wins power. How proud that Corbynite racists plaster Jew-hating posters across London.It’s what happens when you campaign, as Corbyn did, for the right to be more racist towards Jews than the international anti-Semitism definitions allow.And then there’s Brexit, and the insanely dangerous second referendum he seems increasingly ready to back.But at least Leavers would then know who betrayed them. And who to blame for the years of unrest inevitable in telling a 17million majority their vote didn’t count.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is misery throughout the supply chain.Seven-year-old Joel Urhie, who dreamed of being a firefighter, died in a suspected gang arson attack on his family home in August.He was trapped in his bedroom in Deptford, South London. It was thought a gang had targeted his brother.A family friend told how the lad’s elder brother. 21-year-old Sam, broke down and sobbed: “It should have been me.”He had links to the 814 gang — an offshoot of The Ghetto Boys — and had spent time in jail for drugs offences.A friend said: “This might be because of something Sam did. He was involved with the wrong people.He used to live there before he went to prison and was there for a bit afterwards when he came out.“He was apparently involved in gangs and stuff and it might be the case the people who did it were after him.”Rapper Siddique Kamara was stabbed to death just yards from where his fellow band member was killed.Siddique, who went by his stage name Incognito, was stabbed in Cameberwell on 1 August.His bandmate Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was shot to death in May 2018.The two men were both pictured alongside Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood and have appeared on his YouTube channel.Kamara died at the scene on Warham Street, and two other males aged 16 and 31 were taken to hospital with non life-threatening stab wounds.Moscow17 has been engaged in a longstanding feud with Zone 2 from neighbouring Peckham.The borough of Southwark, were Camberwell and Peckham are, has the second highest level of knife crime in London — with 805 stabbings last year.Tanesha Melbourne, 17, was shot dead in Tottenham, North London, in April while outside her boyfriends mums house.She was with a group of friends when she was hit by a hail of gunfire in a drive-by shooting.The Sun offered a £50,000 reward to catch the killer.It was believed she may have been gunned down in a dispute sparked by a brawl in a milkshake bar.Mobile phone footage of a punch-up may have snowballed into a deadly gang war which left innocent Tanesha caught in the crossfire.There has been a ten-year dispute between the WG and NPK gangs in the area.Corey Junior Davis, 17,  was fatally shot in the head in East London in September last year.The schoolboy was sat with friends when the attacker approached from behind wielding a gun and opened fire in a suspected revenge attack.CJ suffered irreversible brain damage and his life support was switched off.His mum Keisha McLeod said gangs bragged about the killing online.She said: There’s a rap song saying, ‘I don’t care your son’s dead, I laughed when I saw you bury him.’“These are the lyrics of the song. I’ve ­actually had to hear this. They just don’t care.“I’m speaking out against them and even when my son’s killers are caught this will not stop for me.”CJ was killed as part of a turf war between rival gangs Woodgrange E7 and The Beckton E6 crew."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431857217.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"959\" width=\"960","title":"lidl worker gangster girlfriend kim kardashian lifestyle","story":"Gangsters moll Emily Lock liked the high life and gave the game away by posting pictures of extravagant holidays and expensive designer items online.Her partner, Mark Price -

She said the Government backed a Private Members’ Bill launched by Tory backbencher Sara Wollaston – guaranteeing it will pass through the Commons.The PM said: “The stories highlighted by The Sun’s “The stories highlighted by the Sun’s Stop a Stalker Campaign have underlined the too often tragic consequences of this terrifying crime.“I am determined to do everything I can to better protect victims and stop perpetrators at the earliest opportunity.”She said Ms Wollaston’s Private Members Bill – which calls for Stalking Protection Orders – would build on the action already taken by the Government to tackle the scourge.Ministers have created specific stalking offences and doubled the maximum sentences for both stalking and harassment from 5 to 10 years.Mrs May said: “I thank the Sun and its readers for their campaigning on this issue, but most importantly I would like to commend the victims and their families who have come forward to share their experiences and help draw attention to this appalling crime.”Dozens of vulnerable women have been murdered before cops could intervene. The Sun is calling for a change in the law to help police move more swiftly.Figures suggest more than a million people are stalked every year. One in five women may be victims and one in ten men. But last year just 806 stalkers were prosecuted and sentenced.That’s because their actions, while terrifying and intimidating, often falls just short of breaking the law in the early stages. However, evidence shows many stalkers will escalate their actions until they injure or kill.Tory MP Sarah Wollaston has a Private Members Bill in Parliament that calls for the introduction of Stalking Protection Orders.

Known as The Ghetto, it is awash with guns and drugs.Ten people have been shot dead in Malmo already this year, despite police crackdowns on gang violence. In January, Rosengard’s police station was bombed.Police blame criminals from migrant backgrounds.When we visit Herrgarden, three Iraqis in a BMW glare menacingly until they hear our English accents.“We thought you were cops,” one eventually laughed.Doing her grocery shop in an Arabic corner shop, headscarf-wearing Rabia Arif, 30, originally from Lahore in Pakistan, shakes her head when asked about the SD election surge.The mum-of-one said: “I’m worried. If they come into Government they’re not going to want migrants in Sweden.”Her fears may be well-founded.SD leader Jimmie Akesson once called his nation’s Muslim population “the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War”. He wants to stop asylum seekers coming to Sweden and to ban full-face veils in public. In 2010 he emphasised his nationalist credentials by dressing in traditional Swedish costume to enter parliament.Sweden’s centre left prime minister Stefan Lofven, of the  Social Democrats, has described the party as “a neo-fascist ­single-issue party” with “Nazi and racist roots”.SD began life in 1988 as a white supremacist group. They eventually traded bovver boots for business suits and on Sunday may become the country’s largest party, according to some predictions.Anders Sannerstedt, a political scientist at Sweden’s Lund University, said: “There are still neo-Nazis in the party but they’ve been more careful this time vetting candidates.”At Malmo’s Central rail station, we meet a local SD councillor and parliamentary candidate who hardly fits the knuckle-dragging mould. Iran-born Nima Gholam Ali Pour’s first home in Sweden as a five-year-old was a refugee camp before his family moved to the Rosengard “ghetto”. The former primary school teacher insisted: “There are a lot of people with a migrant background in the party.“Our programme is a conservative one without any extreme elements. When a person says something ­racist they are thrown out.”A recent poll showed 12 per cent of foreign-born Swedes now support the Sweden Democrats. Mattias Karlsson, the party’s parliamentary chief, said: “A lot of the crime is happening in the suburbs where a lot of foreign-born people live.“It’s their cars that are being burned. It is their children’s schools that are descending into chaos.”His colleague Nima blames Sweden’s “liberal migration policy” for the failed integration of migrants following the refugee ­crisis.The Nordic nation’s open-door policy saw almost a quarter of a million asylum seekers arrive in 2014 and 2015. More than 40,000 of the new arrivals were unaccompanied children, mostly boys. Schools and housing were overstretched.Today, around a fifth of Sweden’s 10million people have foreign roots.Nima, 36, explained: “We took too many people in too quickly — we didn’t have the capacity,”SD also want to follow Britain’s lead and quit the EU.“We want a referendum on membership and we want Swexit,” Nima added. “We don’t want bureaucrats in Brussels deciding on our laws — we want the representatives of the Swedish people to decide.” When he returned to Rosengard to campaign recently, Nima was abused in an area that votes heavily for the current PM’s centre left Social Democrats.“People spat at us, called us traitors,” Nima revealed. “I was disappointed — some of these people were born in Sweden and feel that all Swedishness is their enemy.”Rosengard — built in the late Sixties as housing for workers — is home to around 24,000 people mostly from a migrant background.Ex-Man United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic grew up here. So did IS terrorist Osama Krayem, a suspect in the Paris and Brussels attacks, currently in a Belgian jail.Like other migrant areas in Sweden’s big cities, Rosengard is plagued by violent crime, something the SDs are quick to underline.More than 320 shootings and dozens of bombings were reported in Sweden in 2017. And there were more than 110 murders and 7,226 rapes — a ten per cent increase on 2016. Rosengard police inspector Mats Svensson says nearly all suspects in his area — and their victims — come from a migrant background.“We can’t go on like this,” he said. “We need to stop mass immigration and take care of these neighbourhoods before racism starts to spread together with crime.”Strolling past Rosengard’s Middle Eastern butchers and grocers, Ahmed Diini, 19, says he understands why crime and immigration are key issues at this election.Born in Malmo to Somali parents, he revealed: “The Swedish Democrats are racist, they blame everything on immigrants. In Malmo we have a lot of shoot-outs. Often it’s immigrants shooting each other.The after-school club teacher — who supports the Social Democrats — added: “It’s only a few immigrants who mess it up for the rest of us. Sweden has given many of us a new life. My father and mother arrived here from war. I am forever thankful.”Back in the neighbouring SD stronghold of Almgarden, undecided voter, builder Pelle Svensson, 42, said: “People here see a foreign guy driving a BMW and get mad.“Just because our immigration law has been s*** doesn’t mean you should vote for the SDs.Just three miles from Rosengard in Malmo’s old town, the gang epidemic seems a world away.White-collar Swedes sip wine at outdoor cafes in medieval squares.Sweden’s economy is booming and it is regularly ranked as one of the best places to live in the world.Yet this “humanitarian superpower” is still trying to cope with the fallout of the 2015 refugee crisis.Student Frida Eliasson, 24, won’t be voting for the SDs, but says: “Integration hasn’t worked. We have the Swedish and the immigrants. We must mend this split society.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the winner of a group has already qualified for the Euros, the next best team which has not qualified goes into the play-offs.Those 16 teams will go into four groups, with the top team going to the Euros. The four teams play two one-off semi-finals and one one-off final to determine play-off winners.So, if one of the Home Nations fails to qualify the traditional way, each league has a path of its own to the finals.The UEFA Nations League rankings will also determine the composition of draw pots for subsequent European Qualifiers.:: What are the benefits?\"The UEFA Nations League creates more meaningful and competitive matches for teams and a dedicated calendar and structure for national team football,\" say UEFA, who believe the new format addresses concerns national associations raised about friendlies no longer providing adequate competition.The format gives Home Nations sides an alternative route to major tournaments.As well as the appeal of being named National League winner after the Final Four showpiece event for top teams, weaker teams will have better opportunities to qualify for European Championships - the bottom 16 in the rankings are now guaranteed one of the 24 qualifying spots.Weaker teams will also face teams of a similar level - so there will be fewer thrashings and more meaningful games for fans.:: Is this the end of friendlies? Not completely. There will still be some space in the calendar for friendlies - particularly for the top teams, who are in groups of three within League A and B and the top group in League C. There will also be room for pre-tournament warm-up games ahead of World Cups and European Championships. But, essentially, the outcome of more international games will matter.:: Will the new format increase players\u0027 workload? The Nations League and new Euros qualification process operates within the current international calendar, so there are not increased demands in terms of the number of matches.In fact, UEFA claims the new product will actually reduce strain on players. That\u0027s because there is likely to be less travel and players will be playing at their own level. Players will also go back to their clubs earlier than is currently the case.:: How can I watch the Nations League?

Michel Barnier said two points in the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal were “not acceptable”. He also said the future of the Irish border remained the “main obstacle” to a withdrawal agreement. The comments made to MPs on Monday emerged yesterday in a translation of the meeting. Asked by MP Hilary Benn whether the Chequers plan was “dead in the water”, Mr Barnier replied: “In the White Paper there are lots of positive things, lots of useful things. I did not just reject the White Paper outright.” He said Brussels will not accept Mrs May’s proposals on customs or her suggestion the UK and EU could have a free trade area which excluded services. He said: “The proposals are not acceptable on customs and on the common rulebook for goods.”  On Mrs May’s suggestion that the UK could carry out customs checks for the EU, he said: “Your proposal does not seem workable to us.” He told MPs he was “very concerned about Ireland” and that the suggestion put forward by some Brexiteers that the border could simply be kept open, was “too easy” because neither the EU or the UK could protect their consumers and businesses. But he said that the EU was “open” to discussing other arrangements for Northern Ireland than the Brussels proposal for it to remain within the European customs area, which has been rejected by Mrs May. Mr Barnier also rejected a suggestion by Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg that the “divorce bill” of around \u0026pound40billion agreed by Mrs May represents a payment for a future trade deal and could be withheld.

The pro-EU campaigner will use a speech on Saturday to call on the leadership to stop using internal divisions as an excuse not to fight Brexit .   His intervention comes after Tony Blair attacked Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership of the Labour Party and questioned whether it can be taken back by moderates.

In a speech to the centre-left group Progress, Mr Umunna is expected to say that MPs are being targeted for standing up for zero tolerance of racism. More motions such as this are expected by colleagues, he will say.  My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most diverse communities in the nation, demands we do - without equivocation, fight this Tory Brexit.

In an extraordinary interview, Oleg Kalugin tonight told the Mirror the president saw Britain as a “soft touch”. The former general said Theresa May should now kick out the Russian ambassador after the novichok poisonings. And he warned of the possibility of further Salisbury-style attacks. Speaking after Britain named the alleged assassins as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, Mr Kalugin said: “The Russians see Britain as a soft touch. “I would not rule out more assassinations. “Now that you’ve identified two assassins, I feel Britain should at the very least expel the Russian ambassador. That would send a proper signal.”  He added: “Putin is not afraid to attack those of his enemies who he thinks betrayed him personally. He would have no scruples about doing so again, through whatever agency.” Mr Kalugin, formerly chief of KGB counter-intelligence, is still on the run. If he returns to Russia he will spend the rest of his life in jail. And Mr Kalugin believes he would have been killed long ago if he lived in the UK. He was Putin’s boss when they both worked in the KGB in Leningrad in the 1970s. The pair now hate each other. Mr Kalugin was so senior, he was one of only three men in a meeting in which the KGB sanctioned the assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov, via a poisoned umbrella, in London in 1978. And he told of his surprise over claims Russia used its GRU military intelligence unit to carry out the Salisbury attack. He said: “The only thing that has surprised me about the Skripal attack was that, according to the British, the attackers were from the GRU.  “In my days, the GRU was only there to pick up military secrets. Dealing with traitors was only a job for us, the KGB.” He added of the nature of the attack: “Just note how differently the Russians, and before them the Soviets, have acted in the US. Yes, they interfere in elections but they have never, to my certain knowledge, even attempted a political assassination on US soil. “Of course, Britain has less means to make Putin feel threatened. But it’s been lacking in strong counter-action.” Mr Kalugin went on: “Internally, I’m not sure Britain realises the dangers. Intelligence activities have been re-activated by Putin after something of a lull under [his predecessor] Boris Yeltsin. “So far, the British Government and security agencies have failed in their job. Sergei Skripal served them well as a double agent, so how could they leave him unprotected in Salisbury? “Skripal was a full colonel in Russia’s military intelligence. He was an obvious target for Russian revenge.”  Mr Kalugin lives with his Russian wife in a small bungalow on the east coast of the US, where he once posed as a reporter during his spy days. Speaking of a future visit to the UK, he said: “I know this could expose me to Putin’s assassins, but I don’t care. I’ve had a full life and I’m an old man. “My last trip to Britain was very unpleasant. The police picked me up as I arrived at Heathrow. They interrogated me about Markov. “But our embassy got me out the next day and I flew back to Moscow. I was not the killer of Georgi Markov.” But he said: “I was one of only three men who discussed whe\u0026shyther the KGB should help the Bulgarians in \u0026shyMarkov’s killing. I sat at KGB headquarters in 1978 with our chief Yuri Andropov [later Soviet Union President] and his deputy. It was his decision. “My department, counter-intelligence, never carried out killings. Our job was to get secret information.” Mr Kalugin went on: “Our science and technology directorate had the weapon designed and constructed in Japan. It was an umbrella that fired a small dart into Markov’s leg. I believe that department still exists.”  He said British security services should have learned after failing to protect defector Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned in London in 2006. Mr Kalugin said: “He met with his killers more than once without MI5 intervening or getting close protect\u0026shy\u0026shyion. “It didn’t take a genius to work out Litvinenko’s life was deeply in danger.” Mr Kalugin was called an American stooge by Putin. He said: “I publicly accused Putin of being a mass murderer for waging war in Chechnya. “I’ve also had the guts to attack Putin in a book. If I had been living in Britain instead of the US, I would have been dead long ago.” And he warned it was possible British intelligence services still have Russian double agents within them. Mr Kalugin said: “We had between 10 and 20 agents inside MI5 and MI6 when I was in charge of foreign counter-intelligence. Russia’s intelligence services, who took over from the KGB, still have that capability.” He added of Salisbury: “I think more will emerge in the next few weeks.” War game is a serious show of strength to UK  By Chris Hughes   DEFENCE AND SECURITY EDITOR  Russian President Vladimir Putin is staging war games involving 300,000 troops – and a social media campaign to wreck enemy morale.

How much more do things cost now? “I do hours overtime, anyway. I can’t rush visits because these are elderly people, and I don’t get paid travel time. I do 50 visits some days. It’s slave labour, really, but we do it because we care.” O’Grady, 58, is in Manchester for a speech at the Mechanics Institute – the birthplace of the Trades Union Congress – as part of \u0026shycelebrations ahead of its 150th Congress, which starts on Sunday. But these women are on the front line of modern-day labour – underpaid workers rinsed in the new zero-hour economy run by distant corporations. With the support of Unison, the care workers have recently won a court case over petrol money and are now fighting over 15-minute visits and travel time. The General Secretary has just come from the early morning picket line at Wigan Hospital, where NHS cleaners and porters are fighting privatisation.  Her job – battling hard Tory Brexit, the eighth year of turbo-austerity, and the spectre of automation – is among the toughest public roles in the country but she is rarely short of inspiration. “Those women on the picket line know we’ve got to stand up for each other,” O’Grady says. “That’s what trade unionism is.” The TUC was born in tough times, when working people were being crushed under the wheels of the Industrial Revolution. At the Mechanics Institute we sit in the room where a “congress of trades councils and other federations of trades societies” came together in 1868. A portrait of George Potter, a joiner and cabinet maker who became the first President of the TUC, hangs on the wall. O’Grady’s own heroes include Mary Macarthur, the 1903 General Secretary of the Women’s Trades Union League. “I love the way she was cutting edge,” O’Grady says, perhaps thinking of the TUC’s new app aimed at young people. “She was getting films into cinemas at the turn of the century, she brought the strikes to the people. There was also that little bit of civil disobedience, a bit of cheekiness. She wasn’t brow-beaten.”  O’Grady laughs. “And, Anne \u0026shyScargill,” she says of the founder of Women Against Pit Closures and ex-wife of miners’ leader Arthur. “She’s still going for it at 80. No flashy ego and a twinkle in her eye. I remember when she occupied that mine. It’s ‘what are we going to do about it?’ Not the big I Am.” O’Grady’s day in Manchester is all “what are we going to do about it?” – not the Big I Am. She would rather not talk about herself, or the great founders of the movement. Instead, she meets the brilliant Rusholme bus drivers from Unite. They took strike action against First Manchester last winter after realising they were being paid nearly \u0026pound5,000 a year less than colleagues at a depot just five miles away.  “We knew they weren’t just going to give it to us,” Unite’s Neil Clarke tells O’Grady. “We knew we were going to have to stand outside for it. But the support we had was amazing. We just wanted the same pay for the same conditions in the same city for the same job. And in the end, we won.” At St Peter’s Square, O’Grady meets the inspirational TGI Fridays strikers, some as young as 18. “We were suddenly told that 40% of service charge payments were now going to top up kitchen wages,” a waitress tells her. “We understand kitchen staff are underpaid, but why is their pay rise coming out of our pockets? This isn’t a struggling family business.” The 150th Congress, which O’Grady will address on Monday, takes place within hours of the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which former staff are celebrating with a party. “I don’t have a problem with reunions,” says O’Grady, dryly. “But I feel sick nothing’s really changed. Those bankers got off scot-free.  “Yet there are one million more children in relative poverty since 2010. And for the majority of poor children, their mums and dads are in work. So the Tory idea that work is the best route out of poverty is one big fat lie. They work all the hours God sends and yet they are no better off. We have to do something about the greed at the top. It’s not about resenting someone’s success but about being made a fool of, taking people for mugs. “A lot of people heard Theresa May talking about the Just About Managings and thought maybe she would do something about it. Apparently not.” The youngest of five children in an Irish, working-class household, O’Grady grew up in family that was often just about managing. As we talk about a free uniform scheme in Manchester, she nods. “I remember we couldn’t afford the school skirt, which was box-pleated. I had to have one with pleats all around it. It was amazing how conscious I was of it.” She shakes her head. “We’ve got to get wages rising. We need a bloody big lift to the minimum wage.” O’Grady grew up the youngest daughter of James, a chrome fitter and shop steward at the British Leyland carworks in Cowley, Oxford, and Rita, a shopworker who later worked for the NHS.

Megan Fairfield, 22, was more than twice the legal drink driving limit when she smashed her red Audi into the vehicle just 200 yards into her journey.

Burnley Magistrates Court heard she had previously been disqualified in March 2016 for 17 months for the same offence.

He called the police and they arrived.

The defendant, from Helmshore, near Blackburn, Lancs., provided a breathalyser reading of 78mg in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

A spokesman for the company said: Addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling are have often been cited as reasons for relationship breakdown but the dawn of the digital revolution has introduced new addictions. These now include online pornography, online gaming, and social media, so it is no surprise to us that more and more people are having relationship problems because of our digital addictions.

Harry had told Dylan to ring the taxi to pick him up from our house, to make sure he got home safe. Then he had walked him to ours and was stood outside waiting until the taxi came. God love him, this little fella was upset and had got on the wrong bus and with it being his first day wouldn\u0027t have known very many people either. I asked Harry had he seen the boy today and how he was and he said he was fine and had thanked him. I just think it is lovely. I\u0027m very proud of him. It puts faith back in humanity and that little fella will know there are good people who will help him.  Tom told teachers he was just happy the boy had got home safe and was pleased that teenagers are getting some good publicity. Now his dad Kenny has spoken out about how proud he is of his thoughtful and caring son. The 55-year-old said: I am very proud of him. He is a very thoughtful lad and has a great personality. He didn\u0027t tell me what had happened until later in the night when he realised people were talking about it on Facebook. He just said he was on the bus asking the Year 7\u0027s how they had got on, on their first day and he noticed this kid sat on his own, looking anxious and upset and asked him was he okay. The boy said he had got on the wrong bus and was getting further and further away from home so Tom thought on his feet, told him to get off the bus and gave him \u0026pound10 for a taxi. Dylan\u0027s mum Toni said she heard about what happened when her son got home from school. She said: He came home and said that there was a boy on the wrong bus and he was upset. He told me about Tom giving him the money and how he and Harry had rang a taxi. I asked him how he had known the number to ring and he said he had Googled it. I am very proud of him. I would hope that if it was my son in the same situation, someone would have helped him.

And while it\u0027s easy to assume Kate and Wills get the staff to do the dreaded new school shoes run, that wasn\u0027t the case this year. Kate was spotted taking her two eldest children shopping at Peter Jones in London, which is part of the John Lewis group, a few weeks ago. But it sounds like things weren\u0027t all plain sailing, as she made a common mistake lots of other parents make whenever it comes to shop shopping.  A source told Hello! that Kate forgot to pack socks for George and Charlotte to wear when they were trying on their new shoes. The kids were wearing summer sandals when they went to pick out their new shoes, so Kate had to borrow socks from the store. Woops! It\u0027s an easy mistake to make, and something all parents have done at some point. Kate and Wills aren\u0027t just hands on when it comes to the start of term tasks, and they are reportedly both regulars on the school run .  Other parents at George\u0027s school say they\u0027re often there picking him up, and they no longer give them a second glance. George started back in Year 1 at St Thomas\u0027s in Battersea, a \u0026pound17,604-a-year private school, last week. He\u0027s got a busy year ahead, and as well as all the normal subjects he\u0027ll be learning ballet, French, drama and a musical instrument .

Everyone\u0027s guilty of scouring the shelves at Tesco or Asda, looking for usually expensive items at dirt cheap prices.  But Manchester\u0027s best kept secret could save you big, big bucks. The Company Shop, which is tucked away on an industrial estate in Middleton, sells surplus food at discounted prices to reduce waste and give back to the community. But there\u0027s a catch, because you need to be a member to go and are only allowed to bring one guest in at a time.   What is The Company Shop?   The Company Shop sells surplus food and household items from other stores. The food costs about 60 per cent less than its recommended retail price, according to the Manchester Evening News.  Surplus stock includes items that are misshapen, close to their sell-by date or have damaged or incorrect promotional packaging. The Company Shop sells items from places like ASDA, Morrisons, The Co-operative, M\u0026ampS, Tesco, Nestl\u0026eacute, Ocado, Tetley, Young’s and Muller.  Who can shop there?   The shop is strictly members only, although members can bring one guest with them per visit. To become a member, you must fit the following criteria:  Be over 18 years of age Work in the emergency services – including the fire brigade, police and those employed directly by the NHS, or Be a current or retired employee by one of their partners - ie a company that supplies food to the Company Shop. The Company Shop has a long list of suppliers across the food industry, and its website advises people wanting to apply to be members to check with their employers to see if they are signed up to the membership scheme.    If you meet the above criteria, you can apply via this form wwwpanyshop/company-shop/who-is-company-shop-for/membership-application-form .   Why do they sell surplus food?  The food industry throws away around 3.5m tonnes of food away every year. The Company Shop aims to reduce this waste, and so sells the surplus food on at low prices. If it didn’t do this, the food would end up in landfill.   Does the Company Shop have any plans to expand its membership criteria?  As stock is limited, the Company Shop believe it is important to follow strict rules on membership. There are currently five Company Shop stores in the UK, with a sixth due to open in September. When the store opening, Company Shop director Tom Rumboll told the Manchester Evening News: “We’ve had such a warm reception in Middleton.

As well as food, clothing, household items and everything else it currently stocks, Asda is now offering three new features in one of its stores - and they\u0027re rather surprising additions.  The Bristol shop is being transformed into a Super Centre as part of a \u0026pound8.2m refurbishment, reports Bristol Live .  The first new addition is a \u0027concept cafe\u0027, which is designed like a rainforest and will include table service and a \u0027premium menu\u0027.  Another new addition will be a photo printing service. Max Spielmann already has bases in Tesco stores in the area, and will now also be offering its services to Asda customers. As well as tucking into a nice meal and getting their photos printed, customers will also be able to have a haircut at the new barbers shop at the site. In the clothing department at Patchway Asda customers will also be able to try out new digital screens which will model the items, and show how they can be adapted for different weather and trends. It\u0027s the first time the screens have appeared in any of the chain\u0027s stores, and it\u0027s sure to be a big hit with customers.

Take Boris Johnson , who’s decided in his 25th wedding anniversary year to let it be known his marriage is dead, so when he makes a play for the Tory leadership his leg-over longings won’t count against him.   Then there’s Tony Blair , who took time out from lobbying for a gas \u0026shypipeline on behalf of his autocratic Azerbaijani paymasters, to give an important interview with the BBC.  As we hit the 10th anniversary of the banking crash, was he finally going to admit that his government’s lax \u0026shyregulation and its attitude of being “intensely relaxed” about the rich getting richer, helped cause the worst depression since the 1920s? Maybe an apology, or an attack on The Big Swinging Dicks who caused it, then were allowed to speed past the rest of us in shiny red Lamborghinis while we sat in clapped-out Ladas in the slow lane? No. Just an attack on a Labour Party leadership that is proposing policies that would rein in the City-led greed that holds our country back. This past decade, while banks have grown bigger, richer and more untouchable on taxpayer subsidies, ordinary people have been punished with a brutal austerity programme which has seen their wages stagnate and personal debt rocket. Their recklessness may have ruined millions of lives but not one senior banker has been jailed in the UK or one judge-led inquiry into their countless acts of criminality set up.  Today our banking system has more capital behind it than it has done for a century yet the wider economy has suffered the lowest decade for growth since Victorian times. They’re still Masters of The Universe, enjoying eye-watering pay, bonuses and payoffs, and the subservient politicians who encouraged their reckless greed a decade ago are even more in awe of them. It’s as though the political class has deliberately refused to learn anything from that seismic crash. The mantra from on high is still that without these financial “wealth creators” our public services would start collapsing. Even though, like that dated economic model itself, they already have.

Sick John Dickson had spent two decades subjecting ious women to horrific abuse. The labourer, who had raped, beaten and psychologically tortured women for two decades, was passive as handcuffs fixed his arms behind his back. Last week, Dickson appeared visibly shaken at the High Court in Glasgow as he was sentenced to 14 years in jail, with a further four-year restrictions order. It was an impressive result following an extensive investigation, triggered by a relatively minor report of Dickson throwing a mobile phone at a partner. The assault had happened last year on February 24, the Daily Record reports.  The victim\u0027s mother had reported it a week later and the task force investigation was launched on April 3, 2017. Detective Sergeant Iain Renfrew had spotted the complaint among the daily reports of all domestic incidents across Scotland, routinely sent to a task force. Experience led Iain to scan Dickson\u0027s previous record, where he saw a few complaints - not extreme, but they related to a number of partners over several years, usually at weekends, when Dickson\u0027s drunk. And there were reports from neighbours who had heard rows in Dickson\u0027s Motherwell flat, and sounds of crying. Iain said: Gut instinct told me it was the tip of the iceberg.  Victims will usually have experienced dozens of assaults before they eventually pick up the phone to police. There were multiple partners and indications of a pattern of behaviour over the years. I thought it was worth digging into Dickson further. The case was passed to Detective Constable John McFarlane to look at Dickson retrospectively and trace previous partners who could confirm if Iain\u0027s instincts were right that Dickson\u0027s potentially a serious abuser of women. This retrospective strategy has been so effective in establishing the essential element of corroboration that the blueprint has been mirrored by Police Scotland\u0027s rape task force. DC The Police Scotland domestic abuse task force  set up in 2009, signalled a neapproach in prioritising the crime across Scotland.  It is a collaborative offensive, involving specialist courts, greater consultation with the Crown and pulling in victim support agencies like ASSIST and Women\u0027s Aid to take care of women\u0027s emotional needs. Such abuse, once too often dismissed as just a domestic, now had an elite group of specialist officers tackling it with the intensity of a murder investigation. Detective Inspector David Cockburn oversees the DATF\u0027s West team and in 2018, his task force, together with those in the North and East areas of Police Scotland, have racked up sentences equating to more than a century of jail time for domestic abusers. He said: Proving these cases has been notoriously difficult in the past because the vast majority of domestic abuse happens behind closed doors with just the two people present, one word against another. It is difficult to get enough corroborative evidence and that\u0027s where we come in, as specialists digging that bit deeper to find what is needed for a successful prosecution. Going back to previous partners has to be handled sensitively and with skill. We are aware they will have tried to move on with their lives. We are conscious of taking them back, to a horrible experience and of re-traumatising them. That\u0027s why we also need to make sure they can access any emotional support they need.  The starting block is usually with the partner who is deeper in the past, who is likely to have broken off all contact with the abuser. When John introduced himself at the doors of Dickson\u0027s partners, there was an instant response. He said: When I said I was from the task force, they sensed I was there to talk about Dickson. Their reactions were visceral. One woman opened the door, initially bubbly and relaxed, but her face darkened at the mention of his name and there were tears. Another looked away and stared at the wall for a few seconds, unable to speak. In this job, I have never dealt with a victim who has truly moved on. They may think they have but they still experience flashbacks, triggers from TV or mayb e from something they have read.  Sometimes it takes the inquiry for them to see the psychological barriers that have existed far beyond the end of the relationship. The officers are careful not to lead or coerce victims and can\u0027t share if others have come forward, in case they feel pressurised to co-operate. Not all of Dickson\u0027s victims felt they could be involved but the four who did relayed horrifying stories of psychological and physical abuse by Dickson, over a period stretching from 2000 and 2017. One woman was raped more than 1000 times between 2000 and 2005, including in a train toilet. He battered her, spat on her, derided her with insults. He terrorised another by attacking her with his pet 9ft snake. The court heard Dickson\u0027so fathered a child with another woman while dating her.  One was so scared of him she was found cowering in a storage cupboard near his flat. He tried to suffocate his last partner with a plastic bag and attempted to strangle her. The psychological control he had over his victims was absolute and he was meticulous in its execution. Dickson timed partners when they went to the shops and he forensically examined receipts. He told some what to wear, how to have their hair. He liked pigtails and, in his words, easy access clothing. Despite having been independent career women, he forbade them from having jobs, leaving them financially at his mercy. He locked them in the house or hid the keys if he was there. If they visited family, he would call the land line to check they were there. He harangued one woman, telling her she was overweight, despite her tiny frame, and he hid food from her until she was malnourished. During an extensive interview following his ARREST, Dickson didn\u0027t ask for a lawyer but stared emotionlessly at the desk in front of him, responding no comment as a stream of allegations were put to him. If the silent tactic had worked in the past, it wouldn\u0027t this time. David said: He was used to dealing with response officers over isolated incidents. He was probably blase, thinking it was going to be a quick interview and out the door but he would soon see this was a whole different ball game. Before Dickson\u0027s ARRESTed, the DATF had meticulously constructed a compelling case, a fat file of evidence, which would run to 50,000 words by the time the case hit court. The procurator fiscal had been regularly briefed and was able to present 59 charges to the court. For the officers, there is an inevitable sense of duty towards the victims who have entrusted them with intimate, harrowing experiences. For some victims, it is a healing process.

The tropical blast is currently swirling across the Atlantic towards the US and it\u0027s feared it may be upgraded to a hurricane by the time it reaches the country.  But new digital graphics created by meteorologists measuring the course of Storm Florence show it may veer away from the US and into Europe\u0027s - and the UK\u0027s - path by the middle of the month.   Forecasters say it\u0027s effects won\u0027t be as devastating but will batter the country with 65mph gusts and heavy rain.  Lee Robertson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service , assessed the image of the new jet-stream and called it still a possibility.

Latest model runs show a iety of downstream effects for western Europe. However some forecast models are favouring a more westward track for Tropical Storm Florence, which could impact north-eastern areas of the US.   The Met Office in the UK does fear some extremely unsettled weather from around September 15 but cannot confirm if this as a result of Storm Florence.  It says: Occasional spells of more unsettled weather are likely, these mainly in the northwest where there is a risk of gales and heavy rain at times, and with the rain perhaps occasionally spreading across other areas.

Some 40 pupils from Forge Valley School in Malin Bridge, Sheffield, were given their marching orders or put into isolation on Thursday for breaking the zero tolerance uniform rules.  Scarlett O\u0027Donoghue, 14, was pulled to one side by a teacher and told to change her trousers - for which mum Claire paid \u0026pound27 for three pairs from the Asda school range - or go home.  And staff rang her furious mum Claire, 42, to tell her Scarlett was not allowed in class. She said: Scarlett was so excited about starting her GCSEs - I was livid. We\u0027ve not got a lot of money and Scarlett knows we\u0027ve not got \u0026pound50 to spend on an outfit she can\u0027t wear. What I cannot get over is what right does one teacher have to say my child\u0027s trousers are too tight?  Claire forking out \u0026pound51 on three pairs of trousers and three skirts but teachers said the clothing was unacceptably tight. The mum-to-two, who runs a glazing firm with husband Michael, 51, added: Scarlett thinks she\u0027s too fat like a lot of teenage girls - for someone in authority to \u0027say your clothes are too tight\u0027 is disgusting. A lot of girls also have issues about their weight and their body image. So if you have an adult telling you the skirt is too tight it\u0027s going to hugely harm your self-esteem. What is that saying to teenage girls about their self-confidence when they are already worried about their weight. They\u0027re sexualising young girls who should be allowed to wear whatever they want to wear.  Scarlett has been very upset and angry about the whole thing. We spent over \u0026pound50 on new school uniforms and the school are not going to give me that back. It was the second time Scarlett had been pulled up over uniform after she arrived in school the previous day wearing a skirt which staff also said was unacceptably tight. An online petition has been signed by more than 500 parents, angry with the uniform policy. But Dale Barrowclough, headteacher at the school, said: We have the uniform policy because it promotes a professional ethos in the school and it allows pupils who can\u0027t afford branded clothes to avoid bullying. This is something that was raised by parents and which is why they wanted the uniform policy and it would be unfair to change it now. I\u0027m not prepared to relax our high standards. It\u0027s why Forge Valley is oversubscribed and we could not say that when the school opened. Parents are always given adequate warning about next year\u0027s uniform in my end of summer term letter which says that full uniform must be worn for the start of September. Mr Barrowclough said a small number of pupils were sent home from school on Wednesday but said he could empathise with parents over buying uniforms.

Jealous college student Anna Dickinson, 18, recruited two friends to help her launch a savage assault on Tyrone Baines, also 18, in the dead of night after she learnt he was dating another girl. After making threats to ‘\u0027bang’\u0027 and ‘\u0027stab’\u0027 his new girlfriend, Dickinson and her accomplices burst into 18-year old Mr Baines\u0027 home in Lancaster whilst the couple were in bed together.

Dickinson and her best friend Kathryn Stanley, 18, then burst into his bedroom where the unnamed girl, 17, was lying in bed naked.

I struggle day to day now to leave the house without somebody. What they did to me will stay with me for the rest of my life and I will always have the scars on my back. “I have started counselling and I am trying to deal with how to trust people again in my life. I am scared and fearful of them. She was contacting my friends and calling me a liar and trying to intimidate me.” At Preston Crown Court Dickinson, Stanley and Jordan Gardner, 18, all of Lancaster admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and unlawful wounding. Dickinson and Stanley were locked up for 32 months in a young offenders institution and Gardner a close friend of Tyrone was detained for 21 months.  As sentences were passed fighting broke out between loved ones of the families.  The incident took place on February 19 after Tyrone split up with Dickinson following a four month fling and began dating the other girl. Prosecutor Raymond Smith said: “Dickinson and the girl had been friends and known each other for some years.  But the friendship between the two of them deteriorated to the point Dickinson sent messages via social media threatening to “bang” and “stab” her. That day Dickinson had sent messages to Tyrone asking if his girlfriend was at home. \u0027\u0027Some time later Tyrone and his partner went to bed and fell asleep.  Two hours later, Tyrone was woken up by Gardner shouting to be let in. Tyrone got out of bed partially dressed and went downstairs and heard Gardner trying to get in through the living room window. “Tyrone opened the door and Gardner came into the house running upstairs, whilst Dickinson and Stanley also came into the house and came running upstairs.  Dickinson was carrying a knife and Tyrone recognised it as being from the kitchen. In light of the previous threats Tyrone was scared for his girlfriend and he tried to hold the bedroom door shut.  “But Dickinson was stabbing at him trying to get around him. Tyrone was trying to reason with the two women. Tyrone was being stabbed many times by Dickinson. Eventually he failed to stop them gaining entry to the bedroom and witnessed the attack on his partner. “By this stage Gardner was leaving and had left the house. Tyrone had sustained stab wounds to the neck and back and had cuts to the back and bruises to his neck where Dickinson had tried to bite him when she was trying to get past him. “The female victim could see that Tyrone was struggling with the two women and she could see a knife in Dickinson\u0027s hand.  Stanley ran into the room and jumped on top of her and punched her to the head and body. She held her wrists making it difficult for her to defend herself. “She remembers the blade of the knife being held to her throat and being stabbed on her arm by Dickinson. She then remembers Stanley shouting: “I didn’t think you were going to stab her.” Tyrone had gone to get the two women out of the bedroom when the female noticed she was bleeding from many wounds.  In her statement she said she was frightened and thought she was going to be killed.  The girl suffered stab wounds to her arms neck and face plus wounds to her left upper back and chest.  Tyrone had wounds to his back and chest.  After the attack Dickinson called her mother requesting a lift and made a telephone call at 4am to tell a friend what she had done. Mr Smith added: “Dickinson played a leading role in the group attack. It is aggravated by the location and time of the offence, this was in the victim’s bedroom when she was naked and asleep.\u0027\u0027 Dickinson\u0027s lawyer Amanda Hamilton said: “She is accepting of what happened and has deep regrets and hurt for the two people who suffered significant wounds.  She was in a relationship with Tyrone, he was the man she loved and there was a desperate nature of the relationship, it was a difficult one. She wishes she didn’t attend Tyrone’s house in that night. “She accepts she went to the house and took a weapon with her but she didn’t make threats to use the weapon. She wants to face up to and understand what happened that night. She wants the victims to know how truly sorry she is.   “She has done a lot of volunteer work with animals, she enjoys working with cats and dogs . She has an extremely supportive family.  She doesn’t recall sending these messages and they have disappeared from social media, but as the prosecution witnesses are saying they received them, she accepts that. Since her arrest she has found a group of friends who support her.”  Robert Elias for Stanley, said: “She did not have a quarrel, she had not been scorned but she was holding Dickinson\u0027s hand. She had no knowledge of her friend picking up the knife. This wasn’t premeditated, she didn’t knew it was going to happen. “Once the momentum began she took part. She climbed by that young lady, struck her, then unknowing there was a knife she offered the responsibility and prospect of matters getting worse. She was horrified, she was shouting about the need for it to happen.  “Since the incident she has moved counties. She presents to be quite an intelligent young woman and is frustrated with herself for having got in this situation, she doesn’t blame Miss Dickinson, she thinks she should have seen through the anger before there was this confrontation. “ She was there for other reasons, she wanted to show loyalty and to help her friend. She is wanting to make a go of things.” Sentencing Judge Heather Lloyd said: “Tyrone Baines and the female victim began to get close and it was clear you did not like the fact they were together. It is clear from the messages you were threatening to stab his girlfriend and on that night that is precisely what you did.

Aaron, 36, has dreamt of living in a 1930s\u0027 home complete with authentic gadgets and furniture from the era ever since he was a five-year-old boy. He is the proud owner of a modest three-bedroom semi - built in 1937 - looks like the rest of the suburban street from the outside but is a time capsule inside. Everything inside is from a bygone era, including the rare wallpaper, coal fires and electric cooker which was one of the first of its kind. Aaron recalls browsing junk shops aged five, picking up an old radiogram, hoover, mincers and gas lamps during trips with his grandmother\u0027s sister. Since then, he has slowly become enamoured with the decade\u0027s style and way of life. He bought his current home in Blackpool, Lancs., for \u0026pound87,000 in 2007 after it had stood empty for nearly a decade.  The enthusiast has worked tirelessly to transform the house - installing German wallpaper which was buried in a time capsule in the 1930s and cost Aaron \u0026pound100 a roll. He sleeps in a vintage bed, has a GEC cooker, doesn\u0027t own a television or fridge and still uses a laundry mangle. Not content with just looking like it\u0027s in the 1930s, the house also runs like a pre-war one would have, heated by four coal fires and without double glazing windows. He said: From the age of five I always liked the music, a lot of people think I\u0027ve been here before. My grandmother\u0027s sister would take me round junk shops and I collected a lot of gramophones.  The first ever item I bought was an old radiogram from the 1950s and an old hoover, as well old mincers and gas lamps. It\u0027s all bits like that as to how it all started and it\u0027s got a bit out of hand since. I\u0027ve tried to make sure all the items in the house are originals, rather than being replicas. My pride of joy is an HMV state of the art gramophone from 1937. It came from an old house down south where bits and pieces were being sold off, and a friend of a friend told me about it. Anyone that comes to the house absolutely love it, I\u0027m not saying they would want to live in it but I\u0027ve not really had any bad feedback. Aaron, who has no children, loves 1930s vocalists including Judy Garland, Jessie Matthews and Billie Holiday and even watches silent films.  When at home, he wears vintage clothes, sports a slick back undercut hairstyle and bearded finish and eats a 1930s diet - including cooking foods in beef dripping. The house was built in 1937 so this house always had a toilet, he added. It runs on coal so I have to lit the fire in the backroom for hot water. If I buy a rib of beef and have friends for tea I will cook it the old fashioned way, I don\u0027t use oil.  The washing machine I\u0027ve got is a Hotpoint electric one with a mangle. The hoover is a 1934 electric hoover senior which I have been using since I was kid. The wall masks I collected are hard to come by, they are by an artist called John Douglas. I have the King up on the wall and there are thirties art decor original pictures. There is the Victorian organ in there as well as a great big Edwardian sideboard. The kitchen has got the original tiles and sink and cupboards. It\u0027s pretty bog standard to how it was when it was built. The hallway is pretty much as it was apart from it\u0027s got new wallpaper, it\u0027s an old reprint. The items I have sort of go up to the 1940s. Even at the end of the war, you were still living in the thirties because there was no production.

Sub-zero temperatures could sweep across the country in late October and leave shivering Britons longing for this summer\u0027s heatwave. The weather will be a mixed bag in the coming days and weeks - with heavy rain and strong winds in some places and warm sunshine in others - before temperatures eventually plunge. This weekend will be wet and windy across much of the UK with a washout expected in parts of Wales.  As much as 40-50mm of rain could fall in some places in Wales by Sunday night. The heaviest rain on Saturday will be over north-west Wales and north-west England, with outbreaks of rain in central parts of the UK. Much of Scotland will be dry with some sunny spells. Rain will continue to fall across central regions and spread north into Northern Ireland and southern Scotland on Saturday night, with chilly temperatures in north-west Scotland.    On Sunday, the rain will clear to sunshine and showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales will be cloudy with patchy rain moving to the south-east, but it will feel warm in any sunshine across the south. Forecasters say a north-south divide is poised to take hold of Britain early next week. It will be cool and wet in the northern half of the country, while the south will see the return of an Indian Summer. Daytime temperatures are forecast to potentially drop to the low teens in parts of northern England and Scotland, while highs will be around the mid teens to low 20s elsewhere, with the best of the warmth in the south-east.  Sarah Sammy, a forecaster with The Weather Channel, said after an unsettled weekend conditions will improve across the south, but stay very mixed in the north.   She said: Rain will affect much of the north on Monday, particularly in the northwest. This will gradually extend across Ireland to affect northwest England, Wales and the Midlands during the day. The far south and southeast should be drier but cloudy, likewise for the northeast and eastern Scotland in the later afternoon. Maximum temperatures will range from 14 to 19C in the north and 15 to 21C in the south. By Tuesday, the mercury should rise up to 3-5C above average for the time of year across the south, with highs of 24C likely in the capital. It\u0027ll be a largely cloudy day for all. But umbrellas will be needed in northern and western regions as low pressure is set to bring persistent, and at times heavy, outbreaks of above average rainfall. Ms Sammy added: Tuesday should see further rain across Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Northern England. The Midlands and southern England should remain mostly dry with sunny spells developing - it\u0027ll feel very warm in these areas too.

The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claims the abuse she suffered between 1998 and 2001 began when she was just 13 years old, jurors heard. Her video interview was played at the trial of eight men accused of sexual abuse of five girls over a five-year period from 1998 to 2003. They were arrested and charged as part of Operation Stovewood - a police investigation into sexual abuse launched after the Rotherham grooming scandal. Sheffield Crown Court, South Yorkshire, heard how her number would be passed around between the men - with others then demanding to meet her. She said: I can honestly say that by the age of 16 I had slept with 100 Asian men - some I didn\u0027t see again.  The ones who come and use you for one time are the ones who are hard to remember. As soon as you get to know them your number gets passed around. Asian lads demanding to meet you - then you meet a new group and it went on like that. I didn\u0027t know at the time I was being passed around when I was 13 but I know now I\u0027m older. Tanweer Ali, 37, and Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, 37, are both accused of indecently assaulting the girl between 1998 and 2001 when she was under the age of 16. Ali and Akhtar would have been aged between 17 and 20 during the alleged period of offending. The victim described how she initially disliked Ali Akhtar, of Rotherham.  However she eventually \u0027fell\u0027 for the delivery driver when he made her feel special by visiting her every day after he finished his shift in the early hours of the morning. She fell pregnant with his son at the age of 14 and gave birth to him when she was 15. The victim claimed sexual activity with Ali Akhtar continued throughout pregnancy. She told how and after their son was born, she \u0027tricked\u0027 him into meeting him when he visited her hoping for sex. She said: I never saw him again after that. The victim told how her sister was also allegedly abused by Ali Akhtar and said the abuse they suffered made it feel as though their childhoods were snatched away.  She said: Before, we would just enjoy going on holiday with our granddad but we had advantage taken of us - we were children one minute and adults the next. We were snatched away. Ali, also of Rotherham, and Ali Akhtar are on trial with six other men, all accused of committing historic sex offences in Rotherham against five alleged victims. They face a total of 28 counts of sexual abuse of five girls over a five-year period from 1998 to 2003. Akhtar, of Rotherham, faces four counts of indecent assault, one of supplying a controlled drug, one of rape, one of procuring a girl under 21 for unlawful sexual intercourse with another, one of aiding and abetting a rape and one of sexual assault.

The teen, who was abducted on her way home from school, said her survival instincts kicked in and she realised she had to work with the man holding her captive.  I said [to him], ‘I don’t judge you for this. If you let me go, I won’t tell anybody about this,’” Abby recalled during an interview with ABC News .  However her initial attempts to negotiate with her sick abductor proved unsuccessful and for nine months he forced her to wear a dog shock collar and call him Master.  Twisted Nate Kibby inflicted abuse on her daily, but she used the \u0027power of prayer\u0027 to keep her hope alive. She added: “I remember I never said ‘amen’ in my mind. I never wanted to end my prayers because I didn\u0027t want God to leave me. “I just really wanted to live.” One of the other tactics Ms Hernandez used was to think strategically and establish a bond with her captor. She said: “I told him, ‘Look, you don\u0027t seem like a bad person. Like, everybody makes mistakes… If you let me go, I won\u0027t tell anybody about this.’”  Ms Hernandez, then 14, was hidden away in a storage container where she was drugged, repeatedly raped and psychologically tortured before finally being released. She was abducted after leaving school on October 9, 2013, sparking a desperate search that ended when she walked into her family\u0027s home nine months later. For the first time, Ms Hernandez, 19, has described her ordeal in detail and told how she is coping years on from the abduction in the US town of Conway, New Hampshire.  In an exclusive interview, she told the ABC News programme 20/20 that Kibby put a dog shock collar on her to stop her from screaming and alerting people nearby.   He also told her to call him Master and claimed that he had rigged the storage container on his property in Gorham - about 30 miles from where he abducted the girl - to erupt in flames if she tried to escape or if someone tried to save her. Ms Hernandez said: “He said, ‘You know, I’m thinking of finding something a little more humane for you to keep you quiet. “He said, ‘I’m thinking of a shock collar’, you know, like dogs wear. “I remember he put it on me and he told me, ‘OK, try and scream’. I just slowly started raising my voice and then it shocked me. “He was like, ‘OK, now you know what it feels like’.”  She added: “He told me call me ‘Master’.” Kibby, now 37, claimed he had rigged the storage container\u0027s door with wires and screws, telling Ms Hernandez that she would die if someone tried to rescue her. She told ABC News correspondent Deborah Roberts: “He told me that he tripped the door so that if for any reason it was busted open it would catch on fire. “If somebody kicked open the door I would go up in flames, basically.” She thought Kibby was watching her remotely because a surveillance camera was always blinking.  Ms Hernandez said she used psychological strategies to stay alive, including bonding with Kibby. She didn\u0027t know his name until she found it inside a cookbook he had given her while she was being held. Kibby had kidnapped her after offering her a ride home, and pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot her when she tried to get out of his car. She didn\u0027t know him but accepted the ride because her feet were sore and blistered.

And it\u0027s apparently been in right in front of us this entire time. The story of Atlantis comes from the Greek philosopher, Plato, whose books date back to approximately 360 BC. According to the story, which has now become somewhat legend, the island of Atlantis sank into the sea in a single day and night, lost forever, after its people fell out favour with the gods. Conspiracy theorists have long been searching for the location of mythical city, with guesses ranging from Santorini, Sicily and Malta to Crete and Cyprus. But now, YouTube channel Bright Insight claims to have discovered a location in the Sahara Desert in Africa that has similarities to the details written about Atlantis all those thousands of years ago.   The Richat Structure, which is also know as the Eye of the Sahara, located in Ouadane in west-central Mauritania. The bizarre, circular feature was thought to have been created by an asteroid, although no credible evidence actually exists to prove this is true. Scientists have since concluded that the structure must be a natural phenomenon. But this is not necessarily as cut and dried as it seems if Bright Insight\u0027s theories are to be believed.  Plato stated in his texts that Atlantis was destroued in 11600 BC, which fits with the timing of The Younger Dryas theory that suggests a comet is said to have the hit the Earth and caused the Ice Age. Could that have been how Atlantis was destroyed? But the coincidences don\u0027t end there. According to the channel, the Richat Structure has a outer circle diameter of 23.5km, according to Google maps. In Plato\u0027s writing, the city of Atlantis was said to measure 127 Stadia, which would equal 23.49km in today\u0027s terms. Plato also described Atlantis in his texts, writing: There were alternate zones of sea and land encircling each other, there were two of land and three of water.

The decline in tourism in Tunisia followed a spate of terror attacks in 2015, where 71 people were killed in three incidents. The worst of that year occurred in June, when 38 foreign tourists, including 30 British nationals, were killed in an attack on Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. Eerie footage shows hotels in Djerba, which were also hit hard by the decline in tourism. Still laid out in all their grandeur, the white lobbies and dining halls remain laden with chairs, tables and sofas for guests. Stunning chandeliers hang from the ceilings and facilities, from a fully-equipped bar to massage tables and spa rooms, remain intact apart from a heavy coating of dust. Outside, the magnificent Moorish-design courtyards remain impressive yet overgrown in their abandonment, with green pond-like liquid lying in the pools, Jacuzzis and water features. A state of emergency was first declared in Tunisia three years ago.  Advice from the UK Government states: Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Tunisia, listing eight extremist activities. Urban explorer Bob Thissen, from Heerlen, The Netherlands, visited the sites after the country was declared a no-fly zone, and where some of the hotels closed as early as 2008. Bob said: It was crazy to walk alone in such big resorts where thousands of tourists used to spend their holidays. It was so silent. It\u0027s like a lost paradise. The pools have dirty green water, are half filled with sand and vegetation, or just the salt is left inside the saltwater pools. The normally perfect swept paths are now full of sand and covered with dead palm leaves. The outdoor animation buildings are falling apart, bars are empty, and the playground equipment appears lonely. All resorts were completely different, from perfect condition to completely ruined. I liked the post-apocalyptic exteriors with the pools the most.  It\u0027s crazy that these sized resorts are abandoned. Most resorts have multiple outdoor and indoor pools. It was a big contrast to see these abandoned decaying hotels against the beautiful blue water beaches. The decline in tourism in Tunisia followed a spate of terror attacks in 2015, where 71 people were killed in three incidents. The worst of that year occurred in June, when 38 foreign tourists, including 30 British nationals, were killed in an attack on Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. Bob and his group of \u0027urbexers\u0027 documented the locations for their channel \u0027Exploring the Unbeaten Path\u0027. He said: I think the area around Sousse was affected more by the decline than in Djerba. I think Djerba already had a hard time in the tourism industry, many hotels were already abandoned before 2015, but after the terrorist attacks it became even worse. I think it\u0027s not only abandoned due the attacks but made even worse because of the media and government. In Western Europe there have been many terrorist attacks and those countries remain \u0027safe\u0027 for tourists to visit. After the two terrorist attacks Tunisia was turned into a no-go zone, many airlines didn\u0027t fly to Tunisia anymore until recently and it had a huge impact on the tourism industry.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd8afaa5cc-e1534862977868.jpg ","title":"comics trader pockets 21500 by selling rare first issues of beano and dandy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA comics trader has earned £21,500 by selling rare first issues of The Beano and The Dandy.Phil Shrimpton, 37, sold the two comics to separate collectors, with The Beano fetching £16,000.The Dandy was first published in Dundee by DC Thomson and Co Ltd in 1937, with The Beano following a year after.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/15111102.jpg-889x564.jpg ","title":"dream comes true for local woman lana in reaching world cup with scotland","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScotland Women’s striker Lana Clelland revealed her dream has come true after she helped the team create history by reaching the World Cup Finals for the first time in their history.A 2-1 win away to Albania on Tuesday saw Shelley Kerr’s side clinch their place.Now the squad is all set for the finals in France next year.Speaking to the Tele from her Italian base, Lana, from Tibbermore on the outskirts of Perth, said: “This is a dream come true. Getting to the World Cup Finals is all I’ve ever wanted.“Right from the time I was a girl at Methven primary school I wanted to play at the highest level possible.“It’s been a long road from Tibbermore to France but it’s been a great journey, one which started kicking a ball about in the Perthshire countryside.”Lana, 25, played for her primary school and her goalscoring came to the attention of Perth’s Letham set-up and she started cracking in goals for them.She kept that going at Rangers Ladies and Spartans Ladies before switching her talents to the women’s Serie A in Italy and stints with Bari and Tavagnacco before pitching up at Fiorentina where she is playing Champions League football this season, starting next Wednesday when Danes Fortuna Hjorring visit Florence.At Tavagnacco, Lana was the leading Serie A scorer one season.Describing her feelings when she knew Scotland had made it to the world finals, Lana went on: “It was very emotional. We were all screaming and it was the best feeling ever. Nothing so far has topped that.“It was just wonderful knowing we were in the finals, achieving something that had never before been done.“A lot of hard work has taken us to this stage and that hard work will continue.”Lana paid tribute to those who have helped her on her road to the finals.“When I was at Letham, the late Ken Drummond was a major influence on my career.“He did a great job promoting women’s and girls football and gave encouragement to all the players.“My family are also very supportive.“My folks drove me around to games and my family back me all the way.“And playing at top level in Italy and being in a great Scotland side has made it all worthwhile.“Now for the finals.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b924897b32e7.jpg ","title":"dundee centre of gaming universe after plans for 9m centre unveiled","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee has been dubbed “the centre of the gaming universe” after plans for a £9 million research and development centre were unveiled. 100vw, 2916px\" /The Innovation for Games and Media Enterprise  – to be based at Abertay University – will offer resources and support to games companies in the city and across the UK.Several companies including Microsoft, the BBC and Beano Studios have signed up to the project with support from Creative Scotland, Dundee City Council and V\u0026ampA Dundee.Local games studios will be given access to the expertise of partners and be able to share new and emerging games technologies as well as forming new working relationships.InGAME will also provide industry experience for students from three universities as they work on business-led assignments.The project was set to be announced today by Abertay University in association with Dundee University and the University of St Andrews.Michael Stirling, head of Beano Studios Scotland, said: “In Beano’s 80th year it’s fantastic to be recognised as a next-generation media player.

Because it was the first time it was exciting, but I soon realised it did not appeal to me any more.”Victoria said she didn’t like the sensation of drinking alcohol as it triggered feelings of anxiety.“Most of my friends drank at that point, so sometimes I felt left out,” she said.“But I soon decided I didn’t need to drink just because everyone else was.“It is hard not to feel pressure sometimes so I had to stay with the friends who didn’t care if I was drinking or not.“I have lost friends through my decision not to drink.“Sometimes it would be my friend’s 18th birthday party and I would say I was not going out drinking.“I naturally became distant from those friends who expected me to drink.“I’m quite lucky to have some supportive people around me now.”Victoria admitted that it has not always been easy to avoid being a part of the drinking culture.She said: “I am very aware of the pressure but I am quite honest about it when I am asked why I do not drink.“It is my personal choice not to and it’s not like I try to change what others do if they want to drink.”Although students coming to Dundee for the new university year may be mostly looking forward to enjoying lively nightlife, Victoria, who is studying English and history at Dundee University, says she has still been able to enjoy the experience without alcohol – and still goes on nights out.She said: “I’ve managed to make friends with people who don’t expect me to drink.”The confidence to say no is something which may not come naturally to everyone, but Victoria encouraged others to stand up for what they believe in.She said: “I have always been quite confident and outgoing but it becomes easier to not drink as you grow older.“I am happy to go to a bar with friends and still not drink.“I don’t worry about it too much.”Speaking about what other young people should do if they are thinking about giving up alcohol, she added: “Just give it a go and don’t be scared.“Imagining what it would be like is always worse than reality.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d427df01-507x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united must win dirty games

comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help

it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d5611cad-e1536054160536-814x564.jpg ","title":"no excuses for display at alloa says dundee united midfielder adam barton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United midfielder Adam Barton insists they can have no excuses for their poor performance at Alloa despite the tough conditions.The Terrors drew 1-1 with Jim Goodwin’s side on Saturday in a game they were expected to win.The synthetic surface at the Indodrill Stadium was narrowed for United’s visit and the hosts made life difficult for Csaba Laszlo’s men throughout.Despite opening the scoring through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, as well as enjoying some bright spells in the second half, the Wasps were always in control.A sublime Iain Flannigan free-kick earned Alloa a well-deserved point and it could’ve been more.Barton said: “If we want to win the league, these are the places you’ve got to go and do the job.“What frustrates me is people on the outside, particularly the fans, who were there in good numbers on Saturday. They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b924a58b7cbd.jpg ","title":"official 2018 was the summer of the century in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee has enjoyed its sunniest summer so far in the 21st Century – with above-average levels of sunshine and drier than expected weather.Observations recorded by the James Hutton Institute, based in Invergowrie, show a total of 638.6 hours of sunshine were recorded for June, July and August – an average of more than seven hours a day.It’s the third-sunniest summer recorded by the institute since it began noting weather data in 1954.Dundee’s sunniest-ever summer was in 1995, when 668 hours of sunshine were recorded across the season.The second sunniest was in 1976, with 666 hours logged by observers.However, 2018’s summer was just the eighth warmest – with an average air temperature of 15.1C, and the 20th driest, with 134.8mm of rainfall.This year’s summer is likely to have missed out on being higher up the charts due to cooler-than-expected conditions in August.Last month, an average temperature of 14.4C was recorded, when the long-term average was 14.7C.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary.

It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline.

His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

And McInnes hailed Shinnie for retaining his spot in McLeish’s squad.He said: “Hopefully Graeme can continue to establish himself with Scotland not only through training with them but out on the pitch with game time.“With the squad Graeme was involved in at the end of last season there were a lot of the Celtic players and established players left out.“It was an opportunity for Graeme to go and show Alex his capability through his training and through games.“He has obviously done that and has also started the season well for us, especially in the two games against Burnley in the Europa League.“He was very influential in those games against Burnley.“Graeme has got the recognition for that by remaining in the squad and I am delighted for him.”Shinnie is the only Aberdeen player in McLeish’s Scotland squad that will face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium tonight.That friendly is a warm-up for the UEFA Nations League opener against Albania on Monday.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna would have been named in the squad if fit.However, the 21-year-old missed out with a hamstring tear that has ruled him out of Aberdeen’s last four games.McInnes anticipates McKenna, who captained Scotland in the 2-0 loss to Mexico, to return immediately after the international break.The subject of a rejected £7 million transfer deadline day bid from Aston Villa, centre-back McKenna is set to return for the trip to St Johnstone on Saturday September 15.McInnes hopes club captain Shinnie can face a Belgium side packed with world class talents such as Eden Hazard , Romelu Lukaku , Marouane Fellaini  and Vincent Kompany .He reckons facing opponents of that calibre can only help Shinnie’s own game improve.McInnes said: “Any time you go away to be involved with your country is a brilliant experience.“Graeme will be involved with some of the countries’ top players.“Then he will also hopefully get the games on top of that.“Ideally he can get game time against Belgium and Albania.“Belgium have some top class players involved and all of that is great for any player’s development.”McInnes and Aberdeen aim to tie up skipper Shinnie on an extended contract.The midfielder’s current deal expires at the end of this season and Shinnie would be free to speak with any interested club from the start of the winter transfer window on January 1.McInnes recently confirmed he would sit down with Shinnie and his agent to try to thrash out a new extended contract.The Aberdeen gaffer also confirmed he has been in regular contact with McLeish regarding Scotland internationalists.He said: “I spoke to Alex after the two Scotland games in the summer and a few times since.“Graeme has made a good impression and it is great to see him in the squad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dons looking to benefit from us soccer boom","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen aim to tap further into the lucrative United States market to secure financial backing in a bid to help take the club to another level.Pittodrie commercial director Rob Wicks hopes the Dons can secure new opportunities across the Atlantic, where soccer is booming.American-based businessman Tom Crotty invested £775,000  into Aberdeen last November after buying up shares.US-based software entrepreneur and investor, Dave Cormack, made a substantial seven-figure investment in the Dons last June through the acquisition of shares.Life-long Aberdeen fan Cormack, who had previously held the role of Pittodrie chief executive from 2000 to 2001, was also appointed to the Dons board.Wicks said: “Football is doing some amazing things in the United States.“We have Dave Cormack, a major shareholder at the club and also a board director who is based over there.“Dave is very well placed within the United States market to look at new opportunities for us.”Aberdonian Cormack introduced venture capitalist Crotty to the Dons.Crotty is a board member and major donor to US-founded charity Grassroot Soccer which was set up by Tommy Clark, the son of legendary Dons keeper Bobby.Aberdeen, AFC Community Trust and the now global-based Grassroot recently entered into a formal partnership that focuses on adolescent health and well-being.Through the partnership a football-inspired education programme for young people around mental health will be piloted at Aberdeen’s new £47m super academy at Lochside.On confirmation of his investment last year Crotty admitted his first experience of Aberdeen was golf and playing the north-east’s courses. Cormack utilised that link and made a compelling case about Aberdeen’s future plans.Wicks said: “There is such a strong relationship with the US and Scotland as we have the likes of Donald Trump and his golf.“If you look at the visitor statistic of people coming into Scotland a very high proportion are Americans.“They love golf, the whisky trail and there are some really interesting opportunities for us to broaden that relationship and look at new ideas and partnerships.”Football, or “soccer”, is thriving in the United States and is closing in on the big three of American football, basketball and baseball.A Gallup poll recently found 7% of Americans named soccer as their favourite sport to watch.That represented a 3% gain from four years previously.Soccer was the only sport to post such a large increase.Gridiron was at 37%, down from 39%, basketball 11%, down from 12%, and baseball 9%, down from 13%.

We are down but certainly not out and we will be buzzing again.“The guys are gutted to lose the goals and make the mistakes they did.“You have to tear your hair out at the goals as they were gifts.“At this level against a team of Belgium’s stature the consequences of mistakes are devastating.“Sometimes at club level you can do that four or five times and still get away with it.“But at this level the consequences are terrible.”Defensive errors while under no pressure from John McGinn, Charlie Mulgrew and Ryan Jack each led directly to a goal.Although frustrated at conceding McLeish refused to slate his squad because the mistakes came because the players were utilising his passing philosophy.He refuses to ditch that and his principles to go route one just because of a heavy defeat.He said: “We know we are not up at Belgium’s level but there is a lot of ability there .“It was a catalogue of errors in the second half but if anyone is to take the blame it is me for telling them to pass it.“I know how good Charlie Mulgrew is at passing the ball but he was just caught out with his vision and didn’t catch it fully.“Ryan Jack was caught with the ball and for the first goal John McGinn turned into Mousa Dembele and it is fatal when you don’t know what is behind you.“They were harsh mistakes. And they will learn from them.“I praised them as they did a lot of good things. They passed the ball well at times and we cut through Belgium to create three of four chances.“There is no way they should be down-heartened. They should be heartened with the way they tried to play.“I don’t want them to just lump it up the pitch.“We have to use the ability we have with the ball at our feet.”Since taking over the reins from Gordon Strachan following the failed World Cup 2018 bid McLeish has lost four out of five games.A victory in Hungary is the only success of his second period in charge of the national team. Under McLeish the Scots have failed to score in defeats by Costa Rica , Peru , Mexico  and Belgium.In the Gothenburg Great’s defence all those defeats have come against teams that competed in this summer’s World Cup.Scotland were thrashed by a Belgium side that never got out of first gear.You wonder how damaging this defeat could have been if Belgium had really gone for the jugular.The reasoning behind taking this friendly also has to be questioned.If the SFA believed securing the World Cup semi-finalists would be a cash cow they were wrong as there were only 20,000 at Hampden. All it achieved was delivering a heavy defeat to a side preparing for a first competitive game under McLeish. On taking the friendly, McLeish said: “We have got to test ourselves and but for that first goal would probably have gone in at half-time all square.“It was a very difficult game coming before Albania. But it is the start of the season and the players have full fitness so they can cope with two games in a short period of time if we have to put the same boys in again.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/08/18, 1:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Well done to young Ella Pollock for recognising that she can make a difference.Something as simple as baking cakes can be all it takes to make another\u0026#8217s life a little better.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

Round the clock activity now sees the company fleet thunder along quiet Green Street. Those living with the misery claim it is an accident waiting to happen and have launched a petition for change. Resident Janet Walters, 52, said: “The buses used to come down Peebles Street but claim they can’t get turned now due to parked cars. “So they’re coming our way and Stagecoach didn’t even see fit to let us know. “We have X77 buses thundering along all times of day and night and the house shakes like an earthquake. “The speed of them is a disgrace and the drivers are taking no notice of where they

introduction of the upgraded, 15m long high quality coaches for our X77 service, which operate from our depot on Waggon Road, a risk assessment was completed which highlighted that due to the parking of some vehicles by residents on Waggon Road access to our depot was difficult at certain times for our vehicles due to the need to make a right hand turn into the depot. “Green Street offers an almost straight ahead manoeuvre for our vehicles into the depot which minimises the risk for our drivers, vehicles, local residents and all other road users. “We monitor our vehicles at all times and

programme exploring links between Scotland and the Caribbean island of Barbados.\nFirst screened on Tuesday , Scots in Paradise features the Barbados Celtic Festival \u0026ndash a large cultural get-together held in and around the capital Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion of cultures through music, food and history.\nAmong the many acts to perform on the Bridgetown stage have been the Average White Band, piping pupils from Strathallan School in Perthshire and the National Piping Centre, led by Fifer Ian Lowther.\nSheila Sapkota from Selkirk\u0026rsquos Riddell Fiddle made headlines in Barbados this year when she performed with Jenni Borthwick, Robbie Sapkota and locals from the surrounding area of Hastings.\nSheila, who is from Selkirk, also performed with Barbados pupils from the Suzuki Violin School and children from St Patrick\u0027s RC Primary, playing Scottish songs taught to them by the St Patrick\u0026rsquos head teacher, Glasgow born Sister Pauline Dempsey.\nAnd several of Sheila\u0027s performances were caught on camera for the STV programme Scots in Paradise.\nThis year\u0027s Barbados Celtic Festival closed with a ceilidh, presented by local dancers from the island\u0026rsquos Scottish Dance Society, led by Scottish ex pat Ken Thomson.\nThe Celtic festival celebrates the shared history between Scots and the people of Barbados.\nAround the 1700s, Scottish and Irish immigrants were shipped all over the Caribbean to be indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as Glasgow.\nA small community still lives in what is known as \u0026lsquoScotland District\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash an area of the island that became home to settlers when they eventually gained their freedom.\nAny musicians interested in taking part in next year\u0026rsquos Massed Band events in May 2019 can sign up at

orders it has handed out \u0026ndash after a report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots. It was answered and delivered by these two brave and ambitious local ladies, who with the community at heart, saved Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Post Office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"photos-group-of-flamingo-chicks-hatch-in-oxton","story":"A GROUP of flamingo chicks have hatched at a Borders conservation centre.\nNews of the arrival of the Chilean flamingo flock was confirmed by Bird Gardens Scotland.\nThe newborns\u0026nbspwill form part of a new visitor attraction in Oxton, near Lauder.\nThe chicks hatched from eggs laid by the established Chilean flamingo flock at Chester Zoo.\nThe flock at Chester had a breeding success earlier in the summer, leading to a number of surplus eggs.\nThe eggs in question were incubated by the Bird Section in Chester prior to being carefully transported to Bird Gardens Scotland in Oxton, to hatch.\nIts not been confirmed how many chicks there are.\nFollowing on from hatching, the eggs will take 30 days to develop into healthy flamingo chicks, also known as flaminglings.\nMark Haillay of Bird Gardens Scotland said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an incredible moment when you first hear a flamingo egg grunt at you and you know that within 48 hours there will be a chick asleep, resting after its epic journey from inside the egg out into the world.\nLike many other types of bird, flaminglings have an egg-tooth on the tip of their beak which they use to gradually scratch and chip away at the shell creating an opening large enough for them to wriggle free of the shell and out into the world.\nThe flaminglings will be hand reared in Oxton, fed every two hours round the clock with a specialist liquidised diet fed through a syringe.\nThis mimics the beak-to-beak feeding which would occur in parent reared birds parent flamingos produce a rich saliva  and dribble this into the chick\u0026rsquos beak providing all the water, nutrients and energy they need to grow and stay healthy.\nMark added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting to think these little balls of grey fluff will grow to be majestic flamingos.

experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it

halves.Despite having an intensive and productive pre-season programme, the Pupils somehow went missing for the first forty-five minutes of last Saturday’s Argyll derby against the previous season’s runaway Premier Two champions, Lochgilphead Red Star.For whatever reason, the local lads looked completely out of sorts from the start, scorning ball possession for the direct ‘killer’ pass behind the visitor’s resolute back four.This tactic was never on because of a following breeze and the unpredictability of a wet greasy surface.Nevertheless, Sary Rhama showed his mettle when a parting shot was unlucky to slam off the cross bar with the keeper well beaten.Minutes later, Star’s imposing last of defence pulled off a great one-handed stop as he launched himself to turn the ball round the post.The first half was anything but a classic, and although the local McFadyen sponsored Pupils had the lion’s share of possession, they were fortunate to see a low strike clatter off the base the post with the home keeper well beaten.Minutes before half-time, a searching cross-field pass caused confusion in the home defence, and with two men going for the same ball, Lee McLean picked up the loose ends to cut inside and send the ball into the far corner of the net for the opener,Cue the second half, and it was transformation time as far as the home side was concerned.Night and day would be an accurate description of their play, as the Pupils pounded the Lochgilphead rearguard in search of the equaliser.A headed clearance early in the second half fell short of its mark, and this allowed Robin Barr to chest down and hit a sweet volley past a despairing last line of defence – all square and everything to play for!Gary Grumoli was next up, and his angled drive was tipped onto the inside of the post before it running invitingly along the goal line before being thumped to safety.Liam Renton had a great run into the box this before his inch perfect cross found Rhama whose parting shot was smothered by a grateful but fortunate goalkeeper.Lochgilphead were very aware of the threat of Donald McCallum on the Pupils right flank, doubling up defensively to crowd out the ex-Dumbarton man at every opportunity.As the Pupils committed forward there was always the chance of a goal on the break, but the home defence copped well and received good support from their midfield to nullify any threat.In the end both teams had to settle for a point apiece in he first derby of the season, on reflection, the visitors the happier of the two sides after withstanding a veritable siege for almost two-thirds of the second period.A decent sized home crowd enjoyed the second half after an uncharacteristic slow start by the local favourites.It is on to the Scottish Cup and a game

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The site is a popular gathering place for youths in the area and, although covered by CCTV, it has not acted as a deterrent.  There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half. News filtered through that Switzerland had been held by Poland and two minutes later Scotland had booked their place in the 2019 World Cup."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night. His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8557817.jpg?type=article-full","title":"faith-no-more-questions-over-a-liberal-approach-as-church-of-scotland-affiliation-plummets","story":"  The latest Scottish Social Attitudes survey has caused disquiet in some quarters as it reveals that those that say they belong to the Church of Scotland have fallen from 32% in 15 years ago to just 18% in 2017.  It also shows the numbers that say they are Roman Catholic has dipped slightly from 13%, 15 years ago to 12% last year.  But those who say they have no religion has shot up from 43% in 2003 to 56% in 2017.  Ian Montagu, senior researcher at the Scottish Centre for Social Research, said: \"This year\u0026rsquos figures reinforce a gradual picture of overall decline in religious identity in Scotland \u0026ndash a decline most keenly felt by the Kirk.\"  He said the four per cent of people aged 18-34 identifying with the Church of Scotland is \"particularly low\". In 2002 it was 14%.  Mr Montagu added: \u0026ldquoAs attitudes in Scotland become more socially liberal on issues like same sex relationships and abortion, church leaders will no doubt be considering how to better connect to a changing society.  \"It will be interesting to see what impact liberalising measures, such as the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos efforts to allow ministers to conduct same-sex marriages, have upon these numbers in the future.  In June, the largest Protestant church in Northern Ireland voted to sever ties with the Church of Scotland due to what it felt was the Kirk\u0027s more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.    The unprecedented move by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland means the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will no longer be invited to the annual meeting of the church\u0027s General Assembly in Belfast. And the PCI will no longer accept invitations.  Survey data also reveals that in 2009, over one in three said they had attended a Church of Scotland at least once a month, but in 2017 it had dropped to one in four, according to the survey. Those who went to a Catholic church at least once a month dipped from 60% nine years ago to 52% last year.  A Catholic Church spokesman said \u0026ldquoWhile it is reassuring to see Catholic figures remaining relatively constant, the decline in other Christian churches is very concerning.  \"An analysis of numbers however should not ignore the significant social capital the Christian church contributes to Scottish society.\"  A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said there were ious surveys and reports on congregational numbers and religious affiliation and \"differing interpretations of their meaning\".  She added: Our view is that we endeavour to be a Christian presence in communities and a force for good and we will continue to focus on that.  \u0026ldquoJesus called every Christian to be faithful to God and to make a positive difference in the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is why throughout history you have found Christians fighting injustice and inequality, being a voice for the poor and standing up for those who otherwise were alone.  \u0026ldquoJesus called this being a light in the darkness.  \u0026ldquoThe Church of Scotland is there to celebrate with individuals and families in the happy times but also to provide support during the difficult and sad times.  \u0026ldquoIrrespective of the Church\u0026rsquos popularity, that calling remains the same and is why today you still find Christians active at all levels of society.  \u0026ldquoWhether we are many or we are few, the church will always seek to be a force for good in society.\"  The Church of Scotland backed a report in May which could lead to same-sex marriages in church.  The General Assembly backed a motion which tasked a committee with drafting church law on the issue.  Its legal questions committee was asked to report back to the annual meeting of the decision-making body in 2020.

Party sources have told The Herald that there is a growing expectation that the deputy leader Jo Swinson, 38, will take Sir Vince\u0026rsquos place within 12 months, barring a snap poll in the wake of Brexit.  Already talk of introducing a Canadian-style plan to open up the leadership to a non-MP appears to have rapidly quietened. One senior party figure branded the proposal \u0026ldquobonkers.  In the speech, at the National Liberal Club in London, Sir Vince will propose the supporters\u0026rsquo scheme to get what were described as \u0026ldquomoderate, liberal-minded voters involved in campaigns such as opposing Brexit.  He will explain that the proposal would mean the new class of supporters would pay nothing to sign up to the party\u0026rsquos values yet enjoy a range of entitlements, including the right to vote for the leadership and to shape the party\u0026rsquos campaigning online.  \u0026ldquoThe Liberal Democrats already have an army of voluntary helpers and deliverers, as well as 200,000 online supporters, who loosely identify with us and campaign with us but, currently, have no say in the direction of the party.  \u0026ldquoWhatever rights our new supporters gain, we as a party aim to be in constant conversation with them, engaging them in campaigns and urging them to begin campaigns of their own. I want these not to be just about stopping things but about growing support for the things that matter to Liberal Democrat voters and to the vast swathe of voters in the centre ground whom we are yet to persuade, Sir Vince is due to say.  He will note that groups like More United, 38 Degrees, Avaaz and Change.org have shown how such regular conversations can happen and help engage hundreds of thousands of people online.  \u0026ldquoI want our party to do that and to offer our movement a political arm within Parliament. So it is not just a protest group banging at the door but a movement with a voice on the inside our parliamentary party.  The party leader will add: \u0026ldquoThe Liberal Democrats are not a socialist party concerned with extreme-left entryism or a right-wing party trying to keep out extreme right-wingers. We are a centre-ground, pro-European, liberal and social democratic party, welcoming like-minded supporters.

But would Press pass muster with those in the trade? More importantly, would it interest those viewers who left papers for the internet years ago? The short answers are no, not really, and maybe, if Bartlett turns the gas up on the drama and eases off on the pondering.  Press is about as true to real newspapers as the sex and revenge drama Doctor Foster was to the life of an average GP.  Among the Acorn Antiques-level bloopers were journalists who typed like YouTube cats, slapping away on their keyboards, unnaturally tidy kitchens, and staffing levels last seen in 1952. At one point an exasperated hack told a contact: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom one of only three investigative reporters left at my paper.  That noise battering the window was a nation\u0026rsquos journalists guffawing as one. Three investigative reporters? Lucky you. Most glaringly of all, there was hardly any ******* swearing.  Bartlett didn\u0026rsquot show much imagination in the stories covered, which were the usual rag bag of Cabinet minister being caught out doing things they should not, MI5 skullduggery, etc, and he reached for the broad brush when it came to the characters: the cocky tabloid editor, the maverick reporter.  The show was saved by the quality of the cast, and the trail of appetising breadcrumbs Bartlett left behind after the first of six episodes. Ben Chaplin, last seen being a very naughty boy in Apple Tree Yard, is terrifically watchable as ego-on-legs editor Duncan Allen, while Charlotte Riley  convinces as the dour deputy news editor who looks like she\u0026rsquos carrying the weight of the world in her backpack.  The possibility of these opposites attracting is promising. Paapa Essiedu is worth keeping an eye on as the office new start who is not too sure if he is in the right business. Then there is the not inconsiderable matter of Duncan\u0026rsquos tangled private life, which included a tall blonde turning up at his door in the middle of the night who did not look like she was there to deliver pizza or give his kitchen the once over with the Mr Muscle. Which, of course, would never happen. The turning up, that is, not the cleaning.  But drama requires a little oomph the way papers need stories, and if the formula worked for Bartlett in Doctor Foster it could do the same here.  Bring on the first blood on the walls dinner party.  After the BBC\u0026rsquos majestic Planet Earth and the Blue Planet, here is your guide to some of the inhabitants of Planet Press and their real-life counterparts in today\u0026rsquos newspaper jungle.  EDITOR  Fiction: Editor of The Herald is the cool, cerebral Amina Chaudhury , while the Post is helmed by lad-about-town Duncan Allen .  Fact: Editors are the silver-backed gorillas of newspapers, much given to beating chests and swinging through newsrooms looking for someone to pummel. There is rarely a female of the species. Will not work for peanuts but expect staff to do so. Often get together with other silverbacks to compare circulation size.  PROPRIETOR  Fiction: The mysterious George Emmerson, given to having quiet chats with editors in the back of his limo, is played by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame.  Fact: The real kings of the jungle and the powers behind any newspaper throne. Over the years their ranks have included more than a few rogues who made Charles Foster Kane look like Charles Hawtrey. Today, newspapers are more likely to be owned by a multinational firm with shareholders rather than a sole proprietor. Far less fun, but safer for pensions.  NEWS PUP  Fiction: Going on his first \u0026ldquodeath knock, calling at the door of the recently bereaved, is boy reporter Ed Washburn .  Fact: As in fiction, newcomers to the trade should be possessed of the requisite mix of charm and rat-like cunning. In reality, if working on a London paper, Ed would be an ex-public schoolboy whose uncle, the business editor, owns half of Wiltshire.  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER  Fiction: Clark Kent lookalike Al Weaver is James Edwards, investigative reporter.  Fact: A rare and fast disappearing breed. Eccentric sorts who grew up with posters of All The President\u0026rsquos Men on their bedroom walls instead of Kylie in gold shorts, they are the true romantics of the profession, the keepers of the flame, and the only hope for humanity. More importantly, they have the filthiest gossip.  NEWS EDITOR  Fiction: The Post\u0026rsquos news ed is played by Shane Zaza and The Herald\u0026rsquos by Charlotte Riley.  Fact: News editors are the meerkats of the trade, much given to popping up from their desk every five seconds to find a reporter they can dragoon into carrying out the editor\u0026rsquos latest insane idea. Highly excitable. On no account feed after midnight or get wet. See Gremlins for handling instructions. Riley also typifies the kind of hard-working woman in newspapers who is twice as good as the men but paid half as much. Not that she is bitter about it. Goes to boxercise in evenings.  EDITOR\u0026rsquoS SECRETARY  Fiction: So far in Press, viewers have only met Lucy , the long-suffering PA to Duncan Allen.  Fact: Outside of the proprietor, the editor\u0026rsquos secretary is the most powerful person in any newspaper and a real tigress. She, and it is always a she, knows where all the bodies are buried. More importantly, she is usually the only grown-up in the building, spending her days dabbing skint knees with Germolene, drying tears before bedtime and sorting toilet accidents.  COMING SOON  The quietly heroic, working all hours production editor who last saw their family six years ago the features editor, usually female but sometimes the odd metrosexual chap sneaks in, which comes in handy when there is mansplaining to be done and the sports editor, possessor of a mind for stats and a six-pack like Winnie  The Pooh."},{"url":null,"title":"tony-blair-says-moderate-labour-may-have-lost-party-to-jeremy-corbyns-left-for-good","story":"  The former prime minister said Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is now a \"different party\" and he hopes it is not \"lost\".  His comments come after another leading figure of the Blair era, Lord Blunkett, warned that the party is facing \"irrelevance\" unless there is a rethink of the \"Corbyn project\".  Mr Blair told the BBC: \"I\u0027ve been a member of the Labour Party for over 40 years. You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it\u0027s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?\"  \"This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don\u0027t know.\"  The former PM\u0027s comments come after Labour activists in Enfield North passed a vote of no confidence in Joan Ryan, a minister in the Blair administration who now chairs Labour Friends of Israel.  Ms Ryan, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn\u0027s handling of anti-Semitism, blamed the 94-92 defeat on \"Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left\".  Writing on Twitter following the vote, she said: \"So lost 92 to 94 votes hardly decisive victory and it never occurred to me that Trots Stalinists Communists and assorted hard left would gave confidence in me. I have none in them.  \"I will be out tomorrow morning working hard for the people of Enfield. Just to be clear I will not be resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.\"  Another former minister in Mr Blair\u0027s government, Frank Field, resigned the party whip after losing a vote of no confidence in his constituency, blaming the anti-Semitism row and allegations of bullying among members.  Another Corbyn critic, Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, also lost a no confidence vote of local activists on Thursday evening.  In a message to constituents, he said: \"It\u0027s not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South.  \"I\u0027m really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today\u0027s Labour Party.  \"I\u0027ve not changed, but the Labour Party has.\"  Mr Blair said: \"There\u0027s lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party\u0027s lost, that the game\u0027s over. I\u0027m kind of hoping they\u0027re not right.\"  The former PM said the row over anti-Semitism that has engulfed the party is \"ghastly\" and a \"matter of great sadness\".

Theresa May told MPs on Wednesday that two members of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, used the rare nerve agent to poison Sergei and Julia Skripal in March.  The new evidence led to calls for Mr Salmond to end his weekly show on RT, which is forced to register in the United States as an arm of the Putin regime.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said this week that RT was a \u0026ldquovehicle of the Russian state and advised people not to lend it credibility by appearing on it.  He said: \"I certainly wouldn\u0027t encourage people to be seen on RT. I\u0027ve made it clear that I don\u0027t believe that people should broadcast on RT.  \u0026ldquoI think RT is a vehicle of the Russian state. People need to know exactly what the Russian state are doing, and by extension, RT are part of that.\"  Mr MacNeil, who has appeared on RT several times, including on Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos show, made it clear he would not be heeding his group leader\u0026rsquos warning.  Asked if he was reconsidering his appearances on RT, he told BBC Radio Scotland: \u0026ldquoNo. I think I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media. Many people have issues with the BBC. I\u0026rsquom talking to the BBC just now. And I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media at all if it\u0026rsquos possible.  He was asked if he would appear even if there was clear evidence RT was a tool of the Russian state, as Mr Blackford said, and Russian authorities had poisoned people in the UK.  He replied: \u0026ldquoWell, some people might have clear evidence of work by the secret services of many countries, perhaps even the UK.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos above my pay grade to go round and hold enquiries into every media channel.  Asked if he believed the UK government when it blamed Russia for the Salisbury attack, he merely said that \u0026ldquoif Russia was to blame, there were ways to push back against it.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe best way to counter anybody\u0026rsquos propaganda is to get on and put a different message, and perhaps a difficult message for them as well, and not let them carry on with the propaganda.  \u0026ldquoIf we only talk to our friends, all we will have is a single unitary voice that\u0026rsquos very much a very narrow segment of society, so I think we have to have broader voices.  \u0026ldquoIf that\u0026rsquos happening with Russia, get on to RT and say that\u0026rsquos happening, so that their propaganda - if that is the case - is easily put because you\u0026rsquove got a counter message on RT and not just the message the Russian government would like to hear on RT.  Mr MacNeil, 48, whose Western Isles constituency adjoins Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos Ross, Skye \u0026amp Lochaber seat, has been an MP since 2005, a decade longer than Mr Blackford.

One \u0026ldquointeresting proposal, as a party grandee diplomatically described it, was opening up the leadership to non-MPs. Really.  Before he made reference to this, SVC made sure he pointed out to the gaggle of colleagues sitting in front of him that they were wonderfully talented human beings, any one of whom could become the next leader. Honest.  Yet, he insisted, the party had to exploit a wider pool of talent. Senior Lib Dems could be seen shuffling uncomfortably in their seats. Message received and understood.

Two of its 11 turbines are said to be the most powerful in the world, generating enough energy with a single rotation to power an average home for one day.  The wind farm, situated around 1.5 miles from the shore, is expected to produce enough electricity to meet the demand of almost 80,000 homes a year.  More than 100 business leaders and dignitaries joined Nicola Sturgeon and staff from Swedish-owned Vattenfall at an opening ceremony on board a NorthLink Ferries vessel on Friday.  Ms Sturgeon said: \"I am proud that as part of this groundbreaking project, the world\u0027s most powerful offshore wind turbines are now up and running in Scotland.  \"The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will maintain Scotland\u0027s reputation for innovation in low-carbon and renewable energy development and deployment.  \"A single rotation of one of these 8.8mw turbines will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours, which truly shows the potential of this technology to strengthen Scotland\u0027s renewable energy-generating capacity in the future.\"  The 11 turbines include two 8.8 megawatt  turbines standing 191 metres tall, which are the most powerful operating anywhere on the planet.  The project has a total capacity of 93.2mw, enough to meet the electricity needs of 70% of households in Aberdeen, industry association RenewableUK said.  The first of the turbine foundations was installed in the seabed in March, with the final turbine put in place at the end of May.  It was connected to the national grid after the laying of more than four miles of high voltage underground cable between Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks\u0027 substation in Dyce and the wind farm\u0027s onshore substation at Blackdog.  The project had faced delays, including a court challenge by Mr Trump, who claimed the turbines would ruin the view from his golf course at Balmedie.  Speaking to the crowd gathered for an inauguration ceremony on the deck of the ferry, Ms Sturgeon added: \"I think it\u0027s fair to say it\u0027s had its opponents along the way.  \"But I hope what we\u0027re seeing today - and I\u0027m going to use this word deliberately - the beauty of what we\u0027re seeing today, will in time be capable of persuading even the sternest critic of this fantastic centre.\"  Ms Sturgeon and Vattenfall president Magnus Hall together pressed a button following a countdown to declare the EOWDC open.  Mr Hall said: \"The innovation we have implemented at the EOWDC - and will continue to demonstrate - will turbocharge the growth of a global, low-cost offshore wind industry.

Had the change been in place last month, it would have allowed the party to suspend Alex Salmond swiftly after it emerged he faced allegations of sexual misconduct related to 2013.  At the time, the SNP was under intense pressure to suspend the former First Minister, with last year\u0026rsquos suspension of former minister Mark McDonald cited as a precedent.  However Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP had \u0026ldquono legal basis to suspend Mr Salmond as the party had received no complaints about him and had therefore not investigated him.  But the new rules would allow for precautionary suspensions pending investigations.  The move flies in the face of recent criticism from Mr Salmond, who said when he resigned from the SNP that he had \u0026ldquoalways thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations. Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.  Mr Salmond denies criminality.  Under the existing constitution, the SNP National Secretary can only suspend members after concluding they have broken party rules.  But the new constitution says: \u0026ldquoThe National Secretary may suspend a member from exercising any or all rights of membership while investigations are being investigated and considered. In all cases where this action has been taken, the suspension will be regularly reviewed.  The proposed rules create a faster, more \u0026ldquoflexible punishment process.  At present, the party\u0026rsquos notoriously slow disciplinary process can only admonish, suspend or expel members.  In future, members could also have their party rights restricted, be forced to make \u0026ldquoappropriate restorative action, such as an apology, forced to \u0026ldquoundertake appropriate training, or be punished with \u0026ldquoany other proportionate sanction or requirement.  In his introduction to the proposals, National Secretary Angus MacLeod said they would see a \u0026ldquomodernising of our disciplinary processes with an enhanced approach on \u0026ldquobullying, harassment and social media use.  The proposed constitution also beefs up the SNP\u0026rsquos policy-making apparatus, which former deputy Jim Sillars and others have long complained is inadequate.  There would be a new Policy Development Convenor on the SNP\u0026rsquos ruling body, a Policy Development Committee, and members would be encouraged to \u0026ldquouse online forums for initiating policy discussions.  After Ms Sturgeon launched her annual programme for government this week with hardly any substantial bills, it pompted opposition parties to claim the SNP had run out of policy ideas and was \u0026ldquopast its sell-by date.

He will also say the LibDems will \u0026ldquostand with parents and teachers if they choose to boycott controversial tests for primary one pupils.  A spokesman for Education Secretary John Swinney branded this pledge \u0026ldquoreprehensible, insisting: \u0026ldquoSchool assessments have been used in Scotland for years.  Mr Rennie will argue children were historically sent to school early so that \"mothers could provide cheap labour in factories.  He will add: \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot for the benefit of the children but for the profits of unscrupulous bosses. Almost nine out of 10 countries in the world start formal education at the age of six or seven. Only a tiny fraction join Britain at such an early age.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why I want Scotland to join the majority of countries around the world. I want schools be able to change the way we teach children aged four and five.  \u0026ldquoWe should start formal schooling at six or even seven. I want children in Scotland to get the long-term educational benefits.  The call received a mixed reaction from other parties. The Tories noted there is \u0026ldquointeresting international evidence which points to very successful education systems with a later start than is the case in Scotland.  But shadow education secretary Liz Smith said these nations \u0026ldquotend to have very different structures for both childcare and general taxation.  Scottish Greens education spokesman Ross Greer said the party had \u0026ldquolong believed formal education should start at seven, as it does in the countries which regularly top the global league tables for both education and child happiness.  Countries such as Finland, Estonia and Switzerland all have a kindergarten stage for three to seven-year-olds, with an emphasis on outdoor play and creativity.  However Eileen Prior, executive director of Connect \u0026ndash formerly the Scottish Parent Teacher Council \u0026ndash warned introducing such a system in Scotland would be a massive logistic challenge.  She said: \u0026ldquoChange is not easy for anyone, and I think we can see that \u0026ndash some of the changes in our education system have been very difficult.  The EIS, Scotland\u0027s largest teaching union, said it was currently investigating the \"opportunities and challenges\" associated with changing the school starting age.  A spokesman added: \u0026ldquoOther countries whose children start school later have universal pre-school provision, something we don\u0026rsquot have in this country.\"  Mr Rennie will use today\u0027s conference address in Dunfermline to attack Scottish national standardised assessments, which have been criticised by teachers.  He will say the LibDems would back parents and staff who boycott the literacy and numeracy tests, aimed at helping teachers judge a child\u0027s progress.  Mr Swinney announced changes to assessments last month after hearing feedback, but opposition parties want them scrapped.  Mr Rennie will say: \"International evidence shows that the under-sevens need a play-based approach to learning with plenty of opportunities for active, outdoor, social, self-directed play.  \"National testing, especially for five-year-old primary ones, pulls Scottish education in exactly the opposite direction.\"  He will warn the minority SNP Government that opposition parties would defeat it in a vote against the tests, adding: \"At that point if the pupils, parents and teachers boycott these tests, we will stand with them.  A spokesman for Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoThis is deeply irresponsible from Willie Rennie. For the sake of a cheap party conference speech line, he wants to threaten the future of children\u0026rsquos education. That is reprehensible, even for the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoSchool assessments have been used in Scotland for years. Twenty-nine of Scotland\u0026rsquos thirty-two councils had them before the national scheme was introduced \u0026ndash including many Lib Dem-run councils \u0026ndash and, unlike the new scheme, the majority assessed P1 pupils twice.  \u0026ldquoThroughout that time we didn\u0026rsquot hear a peep from Willie Rennie.

Ministers want to \u0026ldquocounteract the market incentive towards designer dogs and other pets which are deliberately bred to exaggerate certain features \u0026ndash such as short noses or long ears.

The University of Glasgow graduate has been chosen as the recipient of a Breakthrough Prize four decades after the same discovery earned her male collaborator a Nobel Prize, but controversially left her uncredited.  Now Dame Jocelyn wants to use the award money to challenge \u0026ldquounconscious bias in science by funding a scholarship for female and minority students to become physics researchers.  She said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to.  \u0026ldquoThose are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias, so I think that\u0026rsquos maybe one of the reasons why there aren\u0026rsquot so many. If they come with some funding with them, then they look much more attractive.  Born in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, Dame Jocelyn\u0026rsquos scientific career began in Glasgow in the 1960s.  She graduated with honours in physics from the University of Glasgow in 1965, before moving on to Cambridge where she made the ground-breaking discovery.  While poring over data from a new radio telescope she helped build, Dame Jocelyn spotted a faint and unusual signal: repeating pulses of radio waves.  She was able to characterise the signal and show it originated from space, eventually identifying it as a rapidly spinning neutron star.  Despite her achievement, Dame Jocelyn previously admitted to feeling like an imposter, revealing that she felt as if the university had \u0026ldquomade a mistake admitting her.  Edward Witten, chairman of the Breakthrough Prize\u0026rsquos selection committee, said: \u0026ldquoJocelyn Bell Burnell\u0026rsquos discovery of pulsars will always stand as one of the great surprises in the history of astronomy.  \u0026ldquoUntil that moment, no-one had any real idea how neutron stars could be observed, if indeed they existed.  Dame Jocelyn will be handed the Breakthrough Prize at a star-studded ceremony in the US in November, 50 years after the discovery. Previous winners include Stephen Hawking and seven scientists behind the discovery of the Higgs boson subatomic particle.  The award also recognises Dame Jocelyn\u0026rsquos scientific leadership. A role model and champion for young students, especially women in science, she has remained immersed in astronomy work, championing science, education and the Stem curriculum.  She was the first female president of the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Edinburgh and is currently a visiting professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford.  This year Bell Burnell was named Chancellor of the University of Dundee after receiving an honourary degree from the institution in 2017. She was also the recipient of an honorary scientific doctorate from the University of Glasgow in the late 90s.  Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: \u0026ldquoThis is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn\u0026rsquos work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over.  \u0026ldquoHer example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists.  \u0026ldquoAlongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community\u0026rsquos agenda.

To deal with the potential of a rush to experience the new \u0026pound80m museum, Dundee V\u0026ampA have issued free tickets to the first people who will see inside the Kengo Kuma-designed building.  The opening weekend, on Saturday 15 and Sunday 16 saw around 6,000 tickets have been issued for the first weekend of the museum\u0026rsquos life.  Without one, you will not be able to enter.  A spokeswoman for the museum said that the system had been designed to allow the first visitors to the museum the \"best experience possible\", without long queues or crowds.  After the opening weekend, the V\u0026ampA will be free to enter for all, although its special exhibitions will still have charges.  Visitors to Dundee on the opening weekend will be able to see the 3D festival, which is accompanying the formal opening.  The festival, which takes place on 14 and 15 September, has a capacity for 20,000 people.  Again, ticketed Friday event is sold-out, however, the non-ticketed Saturday 15 event is not.  Primal Scream will headline the 3D Festival on Friday.  They will be joined by singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi and Dundee\u0026rsquos Be Charlotte.  The View frontman Kyle Falconer will perform on the main stage on Saturday, as is Gary Clark and the Sistema Scotland musicians.  Philip Long, the director of V\u0026ampA Dundee, said: \"There is just one week to go until the 3D Festival, a massive celebration to mark the opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee, begins.  \"Over the two days of the festival around 20,000 people are expected to join us in Slessor Gardens for this important moment for all those who have supported and been involved in creating the new museum.  \"The demand for tickets to Friday evening at the 3D Festival highlights the invaluable support the event and the museum has enjoyed, and Saturday is another great opportunity to get involved and celebrate the wonderful creative talent the city has to offer on the day V\u0026ampA Dundee officially opens.\"  Dundee City Council leader Councillor John Alexander said: \"The weekend represents an exceptional opportunity for the city to celebrate the opening of Scotland\u0026rsquos first museum of design.  \"I appreciate that this event will cause travel disruption but we hope people will understand what a momentous event this is for the city of Dundee and for Scotland and why it is necessary to take these measures.\""},{"url":null,"title":"murray-foote-say-it-loud-im-dundonian-and-proud","story":"  As a son of the city who moved away for reasons of employment 30 years ago, it became clear fellow Scots regarded my hometown as not quite the a***hole of the empire but certainly the butt of jokes.  What do you get when you pour boiling water over a Dundonian? A new flavour of pot noodle .  And it wasn\u0026rsquot just outsiders taking the proverbial. Even for generations of Dundonians, the city\u0026rsquos biggest critics tended to be Dundonians themselves.  This is, in part, explained by the multiple body blows suffered by the city\u0027s economy, including the demise of two of the much-vaunted three Js jam making and jute spinning. The third of the city\u0027s iconic trio, journalism, appears to be in rude enough health.  Dundee jute may have covered the wagon trains that colonised most of America but even slave wages in the city mills couldn\u0026rsquot withstand Calcutta\u0026rsquos challenge for the title jutopolis. And with that industry in decline, the days of Dundee\u0026rsquos whaling fleet \u0026ndash whale oil was used to soften the fibrous raw material \u0026ndash was also numbered.  More recently, other totemic employers like cash machine makers NCR have embarked on cataclysmic downsizing, while others like Levi jeans, watchmakers Timex and shipbuilding went the way of the dodo.  Some of the wounds have been more self-inflicted, like short-sighted insistence over a single trades union deal that killed car giant Ford\u0026rsquos plan to build a components factory in the 80s, depriving the city of scarce manufacturing jobs.  And never forget the blatant acts of civic destruction \u0026ndash fuelled by wanton corruption \u0026ndash perpetrated in the middle decades of last century. Where Edinburgh protected the old town and Glasgow maintained many facades of its grandest architecture, Dundee\u0026rsquos city fathers levelled so many buildings of character amid infamous brown envelope scandals.  Imagine, if you will, going back in time and taking a daunder for a mile or two down the old Wellgate steps, along the Murraygate, on to the Overgate, up the Blackie  and doon the Hackie . If you\u0026rsquove seen the Harry Potter movies, you\u0026rsquove just walked through Diagon Alley. Yes, the frontage of old Dundee was so inspiringly quaint that Warner Brothers built a theme park in its image.  Considering all that and more, it\u0026rsquos forgivable the city suffered a crisis of confidence.  But that was then, this is now and Dundonians have discovered a confident swagger. There is much to be optimistic about. Dundee is obscenely youthful. It has one of the highest student ratios of any British city, thanks to its two universities.  It\u0026rsquos at the forefront of the gaming industry and, with a fair wind, the ground-breaking research in the city\u0026rsquos life sciences sector may provide humanity with a cure for, amongst other things, cancer.  Dundee and its people are friendly and welcoming and the city boasts the finest riverfront in Britain.  To appreciate what city living has to offer, take a trip to the top of The Law, the conical hill that dominates the skyline. Look north to the Sidlaws, the range of hills that stand sentinel over the city. Just beyond are the beautiful Angus Glens and the winter playgrounds of The Cairngorms.  Look to the east and bask in the full majesty of the Tay estuary, flanked on opposite banks by Carnoustie\u0026rsquos golf course at Barry Links and the Fife nature reserve of Tentsmuir and Kinshaldy Beach. A trip to Broughty Ferry, just 10 minutes by car from the centre, might reward you with the sight of bottlenose dolphins and seals at play in the surf. If not, console yourself with a pint in many of the welcoming howfs .  If you\u0026rsquore atop The Law in the evening, cast your gaze west for breathtaking sunsets that blaze like a furnace over the platinum and gold of the River Tay as it meanders through the Carse of Gowrie and Perthshire. Dundee is blessed with the most yearly hours of sunshine of any British city. Sunny Dee, indeed.  Now look due south to Fife. St Andrews is 14 miles away straight across the road bridge and the East Neuk villages of Crail and Anstruther another 10 miles or so further.  Look right and witness, between the spans of the rail bridge, the broken-tooth pillars of the ill-fated first bridge, a bleak testament to that catastrophic storm 140 years ago next year.  Now look down. Spread before you nestles the city centre, not the one devastated by the myopic corruption of last century where the town was cut off from its riverside heritage.  Gone is the high-rise concrete monstrosity of Tayside House, the 18-story brutalist council HQ. In it\u0026rsquos place are up-market hotels, thronging pubs, restaurants, wine bars and civic spaces for open air events.  And at its centre the V\u0026ampA, the catalyst for transformation in this \u0026pound1billion Waterfront Project.  That a city so crippled by low self-esteem has been pulling itself up by the bootstraps long before the V\u0026ampA opens gives me great confidence this is merely another step on the road of Dundee\u0026rsquos revival.  The city\u0026rsquos rich heritage is being combined with stimulating, contagious optimism. Dundee\u0026rsquos swagger is as tangible as the concrete walls forming the museum\u0026rsquos already iconic building.  A significant nod to that heritage sits alongside the V\u0026ampA. The RRS Discovery, the ship Captain Scott sailed to the Antarctic, is docked just a few hundred yards from where she was first launched in 1901.  I left the City of Discovery more years ago than I care to count and absence makes the heart grow fonder but one of the best things about living away is returning home to witness this reawakening.  It has taken too long but finally Dundonians are rediscovering what I have been preaching for years: Our home town is pretty damn special.  So I say it loud: I\u0026rsquom Dundonian and proud."},{"url":null,"title":"lord-foulkes-peoples-vote-on-leaving-eu-must-include-youngsters-aged-16-to-17","story":"  It will of course will sting for those of us, like me, want to remain. A vintage who have been lucky enough to enjoy and cherish the freedoms and privileges that membership of the EU affords. Who believe firmly that we are enriched by continental cousins, not undermined.  But it\u0026rsquos not for me that I worry the most. No. It\u0026rsquos for the generations to follow. The youth of today who will become our leaders and communities of tomorrow.  I don\u0026rsquot know how he, or the others, will vote but there is a question of democratic justice that they should not be denied a say in their future.  That is without doubt the most important reason that I am raising the fact in the Lords at Question Time, that there are nearly a million and a half people who have attained the age of 18 who were not able to vote in the 2016 referendum.  And it is injustice not to give them that chance given the enormity \u0026ndash the gravity \u0026ndash of what happens next.  David Cameron may have gone quiet in the shadows. He may watch the wreckage that he has left behind from his willingness to gamble the house on not one but two votes that could diminish the UK Constitution.  Thankfully, his foolishness in caving in to Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos desire for a referendum on his terms came to nought when Scotland chose to stay. But the one in a lifetime campaign goes on, emboldened even, after he opened the door to separation.  Then in a desperate bid to shore up his position in the tory party, to bring the warring sides together, he stakes his credibility on a Remain vote in the EU referendum, arrogantly thinking the result would be a sure thing.  Anyone who watched his ashen faced resignation in the days that will follow now know how very wrong he and his cohorts were.  The difference in this misguided vote, however, was the way it was conducted.  In Scotland the franchise included 16 \u0026amp 17-year olds, EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens overseas.  It meant every adult who would be affected by the result had a vote.  In contrast EU citizens in the UK, who contribute to our economy with their taxes, industry and friendships, and UK citizens overseas whose lives will be more affected by the decision to leave the EU than the rest of us, were denied a vote.  The greatest injustice was the refusal to extend the franchise to 16 \u0026amp 17-year olds, who will be affected by the disaster of leaving the EU for far longer than those of us in our 70\u0026rsquos.  In their stage fright, their battle to remain in power, the Government chose what was an advisory result as a demand and instruction from the public. The consequences of pending job losses, cracks in industry, investors moving elsewhere, a possible new migration of people away from these shores leaving huge voids behind, is all too real.  Parliament would normally decide such a fate.  Read more:\u0026nbspUK will not get Brexit deal if it sticks to May\u0027s Chequers Plan, warns Ireland\u0027s Phil Hogan  Yet the process was so flawed, so excluding, so reckless that it is only just that the franchise be widened for a new \u0026lsquoPeople\u0026rsquos Vote\u0026rsquo.  What options would be put to the people? I will strongly argue that we should be allowed to vote on an option to Remain in the EU. Whether that is against a deal or no deal remains to be seen.  There is no guarantee it would win. Just as there is none that it would lose.  Only this time, all those with an interest, would have a final and informed say on the matter without the scaremongering and underhand tactics and interference that went on before.  If we leave, we must be sure. Those who will be left living with the consequences for the rest of their lives need to be allowed to have a say.  We still live in a democracy. That should not, it cannot, be denied while the country remains divided on the most important issue in recent history.  It is why we need a \u0026lsquoPeople\u0026rsquos Vote\u0026rsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-lib-dems-seek-action-to-help-adults-with-adhd","story":"  Members at the party\u0027s Scottish conference in Dunfermline, Fife, passed a motion which also demanded \"urgent\" action from health services to make it easier for adults to be diagnosed with the condition.  Those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  tend to suffer from either hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour, or can struggle with inattentiveness.  Sufferer Ross Stalker said ministers had an outdated and \"obsolete\" perception of the condition.  He said: \"They seem to have reverted to an obsolete view of ADHD being a behavioural and a learning disorder mostly affecting children, but that\u0027s not what ADHD truly is, it\u0027s a congitive disorder, it affects how the brain works in adults as well as children.\"  He added: \"The Scottish Govenrment needs a strategy that recongises what ADHD truly is, a lifelong cognitive disorder.  \"So long as the perception of the typical ADHD sufferer is an unruly child, indeed an unruly boy, most adults with ADHD will continue to go undiagnosed.\"  Adult ADHD was dropped from the Scottish Government\u0027s latest mental health strategy, Mr Stalker said.  He added that those with the condition had been \"let down by a system that has failed to act on on the latest research which shows that the majority of people with ADHD right now are adults, and the previous perception ADHD is a childhood disorder most people grow out of is entirely wrong\".  He recalled: \"I can remember clearly at 27 years of age the first time I felt ADHD medication working for me.  \"It was during a meeting at party HQ in Edinburgh, someone was talking and talking and I realised I was taking in every word instead of missing half the conversation, nodding along and faking it as I normally would.  \"I was really paying attention and for the first time in my life it didn\u0027t take an exhaustive amount of effort to do so.\"  A doctor told the conference he was only diagnosed after he had retired from the medical profession at the age of 65.  Dr Alan Rennie said: \"As a child I was pretty wild, unruly, and almost sleepless. In primary and secondary school I was inattentive and not absorbing normal teaching.\"  He added: \"At 65 I retired and eventually sought specialist advice, when I was diagnosed with ADHD. It was a great relief just knowing the diagnosis, a huge relief.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nuisance-calls-clampdown-comes-into-force","story":"  People will now be given the choice to opt in to receiving such calls, which could be about personal injury claims or PPI.  Cold calls offering to settle personal injury claims or sell payment protection insurance will be banned if the claimant has not chosen to opt in to receive them.  Previously, people had to opt out by registering with the free Telephone Preference Service or withdraw their consent while on the call.  The UK-wide measures force the caller to make sure they have the recipient\u0026rsquos consent before calling.

I’d put my phone on silent and forgot to turn it back on.                                                    “So they called Philippa and said I needed to get to the hospital in Edinburgh.        “My brothers said they were going to wind me up on our wedding day or honeymoon so I thought they were just kidding on.“But when I checked my phone, I had a lot of missed calls from a mobile number.                                       \t      \t\tWe Need Everybody...is the message from Organ Donation Scotland during Organ Donation Week 2018, from September 2 to September 9. The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.                "},{"url":null,"title":"payment phone line down for almost a month","story":"        A north-east MSP has appealed to the Rural Economy Secretary after it emerged a phone line to help farmers navigate government payments has been down for almost a month.                Peter Chapman has said that calls are being diverted from the Rural Payment and Inspection Division  office telephone line at Thainstone, Inverurie, to Elgin.                                                    This has led to delays while calls are then transferred back to Inverurie or problems for farmers getting through at all as the lines are too busy.                                                    Mr Chapman was contacted by a constituent in Aberdeenshire who has expressed his frustration at the problem.        It is understood that the fault relates to a fallen phone line near Thainstone.The rural payment offices provide information to farmers about application forms that need to be filled in for grants and payments to meet strict deadlines.Peter Chapman, Scottish Conservative MSP for the north-east region, said: “I was contacted by a farmer constituent of mine who has raised concerns about this problem, which has been going on for nearly a month.“This is causing problems both for local farmers and for the Elgin office, which I gather is being inundated with calls.                                                                                                        “Farmers are being kept waiting for long periods of time to be connected, while staff in Elgin do not know if those in Inverurie are present to deal with the call.“It is important that people can reach their local office as quickly as possible, as very often application forms are subject to strict deadlines.“I have written to the Rural Economy Secretary seeking some information on when this issue will be resolved and also some assurance that the Scottish Government is making sure the Thainstone office can accept local calls.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"play facilities to be installed at kingseat","story":"        A long running planning related issue at a residential development on the site of the former Kingseat Hospital, near Newmachar will be resolved next week.                Aberdeenshire Council will carry out work to form a community park and install play equipment, after the initial developer of the site, Avant Homes, failed to install the facilities as required.                                                     The work had been a condition of the planning permission agreed for the site and late last year the council served planning enforcement notices to try to get the work moving.                                                     Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council’s Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: “Although some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment. As such the Council has appointed contractors to complete the works. “The site owners, Kingseat Community Association, Newmachar Community Council and immediate neighbours to the development area have been formally notified of the start date.                                                                                                        “This is the first element of an attempt to facilitate completion of the wider development at Kingseat and deliver some much-needed community facilities for the residents.”The work is expected to take up to 60 days to complete, depending on weather conditions.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspSaturday 8 Sep 2018 2:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"BT exchange gets the bird","story":"CONCERNS have been raised by an animal charity after a number of birds became strangled in roof netting in Wick.An angry reader has claimed that the birds included seagulls, crows, blackbirds and pigeons, all of which found themselves trapped on top of the BT exchange in Union Street.The netting is said to be on the building for \u0026ldquosafety reasons \u0026ndash but, as the picture the reader provided shows, it doesn\u0026rsquot appear to do much for the welfare of those trapped in it.The reader, who did not wish to be named, has said that both BT and animal protection charity the SSPCA have been contacted to see what can be done \u0026ndash \u0026ldquobut to no avail \u0026ndash and is appealing to them to do something before more bird injuries and deaths occur.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove tried calling them but nothing seems to be done, the reader said.\u0026ldquoOver the year I\u0026rsquove seen around eight birds \u0026ndash seagulls, pigeons, blackbirds and crows \u0026ndash trapped on the roof netting of the BT building on Union Street.

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:46 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartSaturday 8 Sep 2018 2:46 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

But defences of \"reasonable chastisement\" or \"justifiable assault\" can be used in court by parents who physically punish their children. Courts determine whether the punishment is \"reasonable\" or \"justifiable\" based on factors such as nature of the punishment inflicted, the circumstances, the physical and mental effect on the child and the child\u0027s age. Aim of the new legislationThe Children   Bill will prohibit the physical punishment of children by parents and others caring for or in charge of children. It will give children equal protection from assault by abolishing the existing defences that parents can use to justify the use of physical force to discipline a child. Those backing the bill say a wider aim of it is to redefine what is acceptable in terms of how to punish children and encourage other methods of parenting.             The legal effectA person charged with assault of a child will no longer have the defence - in either criminal or civil proceedings - that the use of force constituted  \"reasonable chastisement\" or \"justifiable assault.\" Who proposed the new legislation?Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie formally lodged it today at Holyrood.              Next StepsThe bill has been openly backed by the Scottish Government. SNP MSPs will be told by party whips to back the bill and Labour has confirmed its MSPs will also back the measures, meaning the legislation is set to pass at Holyrood in the next year. Part of the bill itself will require Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the new legislation. This may, for example, involve a nationwide publicity campaign aimed at parents and carers, promoting a move towards non-physical methods of child punishment. Who is saying what about the new legislation?Mr Finnie said he was \"delighted\" to be bringing the bill forward today, adding: \"Children deserve the same legal protection from assault that adults enjoy, a position that children\u0026rsquos rights organisations and charities have long been arguing. Substantial academic research from around the world shows that physical punishment does not work and is shown to be counter-productive. My bill aims to support parents to make positive choices.\"He stressed it will not change the way that police and social work deal with assault against children and, rather, would establish the principle that assault can never be \"justifiable.\"               The new legislation has the backing of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Police Federation, Barnardo\u0026rsquos Scotland, the Church and Society Council of the Church of Scotland and the NSPCC. And a previous consultation on the bill received more than 650 responses and nearly 75% supported it. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said the current legislation \"works well\" and is \"based on common sense,\" but their members will be given a free vote on the matter. The spokesman added: \"In law there is, quite rightly, a very clear difference between the definitions of violent assault and reasonable chastisement.\"The former is a criminal offence punishable through the courts, the latter is a matter for parents as they decide how to discipline their children.\"Each Scottish Conservative MSP is entitled to vote with their conscience on this issue.\"Other parts of the UKNo other parts of the UK have banned smacking, but proposals are currently going through the Welsh Assembly. A background paper published alongside the bill says the UK is one of only six EU countries to allow smacking. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland parents are allowed to use \u0026ldquoreasonable chastisement as long as they do not leave a mark, swelling, cut or bruise. Scotland would join the many other EU nations with full smacking bans, and the big question now is whether the other UK countries will follow suit.

Without reading American author Arthur Herman’s bestseller “How the Scots Invented the Modern World”, most Scots are familiar with the gist even if it’s only from those “Wha’s like us?” tea-towels on sale in Royal Mile tourist traps.             Television, the telephone, the steam engine, the thermos flask, penicillin we can proudly roll off a long list of Scottish inventions and discoveries from the mid-18th Century onwards. More recently are Dolly the Sheep and the Higgs’ boson, work carried out at Edinburgh University although Doll’s creator Sir Ian Wilmut is from Warwickshire and Professor Peter Higgs a Geordie.             Historian Herman has no known connection to Scotland other than a fascination about how a poor country on the periphery of Europe managed to have such a significant impact on the development of the Western World.  Having four universities helped, but in a nutshell the foundations were laid after the Reformation by the development of universal public education through the Church of Scotland’s parish network, which meant that by the 18th Century the average Scot could read, write and count while the masses of most other European countries were largely illiterate. Political union in 1707, the end of over 100 years of internal religious and constitutional strife with the defeat of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, and the rapid expansion of the British Empire between 1714 and 1763 opened up global opportunities for the skills and knowledge Scots had in abundance.So what’s this got to do with today? The rest of the developed world caught up generations ago and far from being a global leader in education, year after year the Programme for International Student Assessment  has demonstrated a steady decline to the point now where Scotland is below international averages, particularly in science. The Scottish Household Survey published this week showed that satisfaction with local schools is down to 70 per cent, by some way the lowest since the data was first collected in 2007.Presenting her Programme for Government this week, First Minster Nicola Surgeon was once again at pains to emphasise the priority her administration puts on education and training. “Closing the attainment gap and raising standards in our schools remains the overriding mission of this government,” she said, knowing the data suggests the mission continues to prove stubbornly impossible.Her speech led with a focus on the economy, with a pledge to expand the modern apprenticeships scheme and produce a new skills action plan. The link between education and economic output was emphasised in this week’s “Wealth of the Nation” report from the David Hume Institute, which concluded that a prominent focus on skills was essential to kick-start a Scottish economy which had stalled for over a decade.            The report was produced in co-operation with Strathclyde University’s Fraser of Allander Institute and funded by the Scottish Policy Foundation which has former SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson on its advisory council.READ MORE: Report: Scotland’s productivity has ‘stalled’ in past 15 yearsThe paper shows that despite relatively low educational achievement, Scotland has the most skilled workforce of the developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This suggests three possible explanations: maybe we are good at playing post-school catch-up in the workplace or in tertiary education perhaps we attract a lot of expertise from elsewhere, like Peter Higgs and Ian Wilmut and then there is David Hume director Jane-Frances Kelly’s view that skills are not being matched with opportunity.“Despite a skilled workforce and no shortage of strategies, Scotland’s productivity performance underperforms compared with many advanced economies,” she wrote. “While the Scottish workforce is well-educated, it is not clear we make the most of it, given our relatively low levels of management quality and our high concentration of small, lower-productivity firms,” she wrote.            Poor management quality rarely features in discussions about training, the focus usually being on school-leavers and graduates like this week’s Programme for Government. It implies that however effective our post-school training might be, it only goes so far, and indeed continuous professional development is too often seen not as a staff motivation and retention tool but at best a box-ticking exercise or at worst a costly way to enhance the prospects of key staff landing better jobs with rivals.That Scotland has a problem at management level was also illustrated by the Scottish Fiscal Commission’s report that tax receipts were £500m below target because the number of higher band tax-payers has been over-estimated.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon’s Programme for Government – everything you need to knowIt shouldn’t be a surprise that if educational attainment is proving hard to improve then the economy will be too, but the First Minster painted a different picture of Scotland’s economic performance. “Economic growth in Scotland over the past year has been higher than in the rest of the UK,” she said. “Exports of goods have increased by 12 per cent – the fastest growth of any UK nation.”Ms Sturgeon will be well aware of the international comparisons, and it would be too much to expect a focus on negatives in a speech designed to gee up the troops for the year ahead, but only making comparisons with the rest of the UK invites complacency. Similarly, at a local level in Edinburgh, the city council’s recently revived Edinburgh Economy Watch is a useful document for gauging progress against other UK cities but gives little indication about international competition.            On the other hand, the Hume report is all about global comparisons and the verdict is damning. “There has been little employment growth in our most productive industries,” it says. “Business investment is relatively low, as is research and development spending we export less than the EU and OECD averages, from a narrow base of industries and firms.”Ms Kelly offers no quick fixes, quite the opposite, but plenty of sage advice. A focus on evidence to understand the problem consensus and collaboration across political divides and political cycles, and a prominent focus on skills are but three. “The population of Scotland will need jobs, and that focusing on the drivers of productivity that increase people’s skills and access to jobs will also increase opportunity,” she said.Yet as Finance Secretary Derek Mackay scrambles to fill the £500k higher-band income tax hole, there is an increasingly vocal minority which challenges the need for growth and is dismissive of warnings about the effect of ramping up taxes on the better off. Some of them are in the City Chambers, where just across the High Street sits the statue of Adam Smith, the Kirkcaldy man who gave the world modern capitalism."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797006.1536399992!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp gather in edinburgh to debate scottish independence plans","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The move would see the Bank of England continue to set interest rates and other monetary policy in the years after independence.The commission also said it would take 10 years to get Scotland’s deficit rate under control, while an independent Scotland would take up to 25 years to match the economic performance of other small countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.The First Minister has insisted the report sets out an alternative to Westminster’s “austerity”, but the document has been criticised by some Yes supporters.SNP depute leader Keith Brown, who will chair the event, said: “Wide-ranging and vibrant debates on the Sustainable Growth Commission, and a great deal besides, in the Highlands and in Ayrshire will be followed by the biggest event yet, today in Edinburgh.            “And this is just the start of the conversation.“Specially built resources will allow branches from across the country the opportunity to have their say on the work of the Sustainable Growth Commission, and wider discussions are ongoing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

One of the main benefits of participating is to achieve Best Value in services delivered locally. The Partnership provides an invaluable forum where the partners can co-operate and get this assurance.\nReducing energy costs is just one way to tackle fuel poverty. The insulation and boiler scrappage schemes that local partners have lobbied for, and secured, have also had a positive impact.\nFuel poverty is measured as a percentage of household income so increasing wages can also help. We already have a number of Living Wage employers in Shetland from public agencies to small businesses.\nNobody has said that the named organisations are expected to create 800 jobs.

Islands proofing really worked with Sumburgh Airport car parking charges, didn\u0026#8217t it?\nLet’s not forget though that one partner organisation currently does have considerable funds that are at arms length from government and do could do heaps to further progress towards these goals. Shetland Charitable Trust might yet choose to play a full part in community planning, shake up its thinking and really engage with the community it is meant to serve.\nAlternatively it could be about to lock up its  spare charitable cash in a speculative gamble based on massive wind turbines which don’t have public support and haven’t actually been shown to be able to withstand Shetland’s high winds. This might yet be of some use to Shetland further down the road, or more likely any revenues generated will also be locked up for the benefit of friends and hanger-ons.\nIt reminds me of what Benny Wiseman once told me about that word might. “It’s a brally sma’ thing on the hide o’ an elephant’s arse.”\nPeter, reading from afar, it seems that Shetland’s public funds are spread across a large number of organisations.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

as well as using the Shankill Leisure Centre as the filming schedule continues.\nSchool Principal John Martin said he was very impressed with the attention to detail the film crew put in to recreating the particular period of history.\n“The crew work so quickly to recreate the time and place,” he said. “We have had some of the corridors repainted, signage put up and some of our music rooms have been transformed to look like the Olympic Village were the skaters stayed – complete with itineraries on the walls and training timetables.\n“We are delighted that St Mary’s was chosen for the film project and look forward to seeing the school on the big screen.”\nFilming is continuing on the film with a release date expected in the autumn.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37294538.ece/80de8/AUTOCROP/w620h342/crowd1-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"healing the land organisers expecting thousands to pray for stormont solution","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s time to forgive one another.\n\n\"We feel threatened and suspicious of each other. That\u0027s one of the saddest things.\"\n\nAnother focus will be on the high rates of suicide in areas such as north Belfast.\n\nMr Campbell said: \"We have a diversity of people taking part. The four provinces of Ireland will be represented.\n\n\"The main thing we\u0027re trying to do by coming together is taking that look off one another of threat and suspicion.\n\n\"We keep revisiting our past, and while there is justice to be had in a lot of cases, we keep raking the same things up time after time.\n\n\"Revisiting that stuff that brings up the same old bitterness and hatred.\"\n\nEntry is free for the event, which will run at Nutts Corner Market from 1pm to 4pm.

I wasn\u0027t prepared to do it.\"\n\nMr Bell continued: \"I did argue hard not to do it, but she ordered me to do it.\n\n\"She said: \u0027Look I am the First Minister, you will follow my order. I am instructing you and reversing your decision.\n\n\"I felt bullied into taking the decision because I was taking the decision against my rational judgement.\"\n\nAs Department of Trade, Enterprise and Investment  minister, Mr Bell had already announced that the scheme would close with immediate effect on February 5, 2016.\n\nThis caused concern and anger among potential claimants.\n\nThe former DETI minister alleged that Mrs Foster \"created a paper trail\" calling for RHI to be closed, but verbally she and some DUP special advisers pushed for it to be kept open.\n\nAt the tense meeting in Stormont\u0027s Parliament Buildings, Mr Bell said the First Minister told him she wanted to keep the scheme open in order to consult further with industry.\n\n\"I thought that was totally unreasonable because we had a scheme that was out of control,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview with BBC broadcaster Stephen Nolan, Mrs Foster claimed it was the DETI Minister who had been \"very aggressive\" with her.\n\nIn his evidence yesterday, Mr Bell said that several hours after the first meeting, he had a second \"much more friendly\" encounter with his party leader.\n\n\"Arlene was in agreement then with me and said: \u0027I think what you\u0027re saying is correct,\" he told the inquiry.\n\nHe claimed that Mrs Foster asked for a two-week extension to the RHI scheme which he agreed to. He told DETI Permanent Secretary Dr Andrew McCormick that closure in a fortnight would be acceptable to the First Minister and Dr McCormick said he \"could live with that\".\n\nIt has been suggested to the inquiry by Mrs Foster and two DUP Spads  that Mr Bell opposed an extension to the RHI scheme because it made him look foolish.\n\nCounsel for the inquiry, David Scoffield QC, said they argued that Mr Bell\u0027s concern was \"not so much public finances, rather the fact that changing your position so soon after you announced the decision would be something which looked like a political U-turn\".\n\nMr Bell denied this was the case. He agreed that it did make him and \"the rest of the party\" appear foolish, but he also believed it was a foolish decision and the wrong one.\n\nThe main reason he had opposed the extension was to be \"a proper steward of public funds\".\n\nMr Bell was questioned about his relationship with Mrs Foster.\n\nHe said there had been other issues aside from RHI between them in previous months but he didn\u0027t detail them. The pair had been good friends when students at Queen\u0027s University Belfast and Mr Bell said he had previously relied on Mrs Foster for advice.\n\nMr Bell said all sorts of questions had been asked about his motivation in making his RHI allegations. He told the inquiry that he had sacrificied his political career to stop the RHI overspend.\n\n\"My only motivation was those hundreds of millions of pounds to get back into the health service and our education system.,\" he said.\n\n\"For that I knew I would have sacrificed my political career. I have had two objectives.\n\n\"One, an inquiry to establish the truth. We have got that and I have every confidence in this panel, including any criticism you may or may not have of me for which I\u0027ll apologise for in advance.\n\n\"But secondly, to ensure these costs were changed and that money is now available. For both of my objectives, I have achieved them.\"\n\nThe inquiry chair, Sir Patrick Coghlin, asked Mr Bell several times why he had secretly recorded a conversation with Dr McCormick in 2016.\n\nThe former DUP minister said he regarded Dr McCormick as a \"man of integrity\" and all he wanted was a \"valid record\" of his own concerns over special advisers\u0027 alleged interference in keeping RHI open after he had moved to close it.\n\nMr Bell did not tell Dr McCormick he was recording their meeting because he might not \"have been getting the accurate information\" otherwise.\n\nHe said he needed a \"contemporaneous, accurate account\" of their discussion and because Dr McCormick was then working for a different minister, there may have been a reluctance \"to have information released\".\n\nMr Bell said: \"I had serious concerns that the actual information I was seeking and needing was being evaded.\"\n\nSir Patrick replied: \"I\u0027m still, I\u0027m afraid, why it was necessary to bring a concealed recording device.\" The former DUP Minister said he refused to allow his secret recordings to be broadcast because his only purpose in making them was \"validating what I had to say\".\n\nThe inquiry heard about the spike in RHI applications at the time when DUP ministers were \"in-and-out\" of office in protest at the murder of Kevin McGuigan.\n\nThe father-of-nine was shot dead by the Provisional IRA in the Short Strand in August 2015.\n\nDUP ministers would resign for several days before returning to office for a short period and then resigning again.\n\nMr Bell told the inquiry that this action didn\u0027t impact on his work as DETI minister.\n\n\"DETI functions continued as normal,\" he said. \"I returned on a weekly basis to deal with urgent business, and only resigned when all urgent business  dealt with.\"\n\nAt the start of yesteray\u0027s hearing, Sir Patrick warned that the inquiry wasn\u0027t a \"media sensational platform\".\n\nHe said: \"There is no open invitation to witnesses to come along and use the hearings for the purpose of publishing material to which they object or take offence for reasons which are irrelevant to the inquiry.\n\n\"It is not a media sensational platform.\"\n\nThe warning followed a statement from Mr Bell during Thursday\u0027s evidence. He said his special adviser Timothy Cairns had told him \"in garish and lurid detail\" about \"the sexual misbehaviour of two DUP ministers\".\n\nThe RHI Inquiry resumes on Tuesday with Mr Cairns set to give evidence for the first time. Mrs Foster is due to be recalled to the Inquiry later this month.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"aviation society lands at maze for exhibition after fiveyear gap","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It definitely can be done economically. \n\n\"There is concern about the cost of the project, but you know what they say you can have three economists you’d have four conclusions.  \n\n\"There are opinions either way about whether it can stack up or not.\"\n\nAt the conference Professor Dunlop also released the first artist impression of what the bridge might look like. \n\n\n\n\nWhy £15bn bridge to Scotland could be the answer to Brexit conundrum\n\n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\n\n\n\nThe catalyst for the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland came from a speech made by Boris Johnson in January 2018 while he was the Foreign Secretary, in which he floated the idea of a 22-mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit. \n\nProfessor Dunlop said the proposal wasn\u0027t feasible as the stretch between the United Kingdom and France is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, but was asked shortly afterwards by Scottish newspaper The National if a similar project between Scotland and Northern Ireland was a possibility. \n\nHe laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrick  or a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .\n\n\"One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was £600 each time. So when you take personalised stories like this you can see how the financial benefit would add up,\" Professor Dunlop said. \n\nThe proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would \"initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity\" between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important \"that all options are fully considered\" \n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project.  \n\nThe idea was also supported by former Foreign Secretary, who has called for it to be considered \"seriously\".  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"european heritage open days history opens up to northern ireland public","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

To take the challenge visit discovernorthernireland/loveheritage\n\nTo inspire those interested in exploring their cultural heritage journey this coming weekend, here is a list of just some of the quirky culture and hidden heritage that exists right here on Northern Ireland’s doorstep:\n\n\nDid you know…\n\n\nAntrim: The historic village of Gracehill was a settlement founded by the Moravians in 1765 and Northern Ireland’s First Conservation area. For Moravians, the burial ground was known as \"Gods Acre\" and had a strict layout. Men were buried to the left and women to the right of a central path. All the headstones were of the same shape and design - the Moravians believe that everyone is equal in death - and were laid almost flat on the ground.\n\nBelfast: Next door to the Belfast Harbour Commissioner\u0027s Office you will find Sinclair Seamen’s Church, a unique maritime-inspired church. Built in 1853 as a tribute to the city\u0027s seafaring traditions, its interior features a pulpit shaped like a ship\u0027s prow, the bell from 19th Century-built battleship HMS Hood and lifeboat-shaped collection boxes.\n\nDown: Grey Abbey is the oldest example of Gothic architecture in Ireland founded in 1193 by John De Courcy. In the 17th century the abbey ruins were acquired by the Montgomery family, who still live in the grounds to this day.\n\nFermanagh: Enniskillen is Ireland’s only island town and Castle Coole is regarded as the finest country house in Ireland. The house itself has no back door which is said to be a deliberate omission in order to discourage salesmen from calling.\n\nTo find out more about the list of those properties open in your area for European Heritage Open Days 2018 and to get involved visit \nwww.discovernorthernireland/events/European-Heritage-Open-Days/\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"keep working to end stalemate at stormont clinton tells politicians","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You have to do it because it\u0027s right, because you know it\u0027s right and understand what you are dealing with.\"\n\nMr Clinton was presented with a Dublin GAA jersey by footballer Michael Darragh Macauley following his side\u0027s All-Ireland win last Sunday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts travel updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"test shows some northern ireland meat had up to four animals in it","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

has revealed that meat being sold in Northern Ireland contains the DNA of different animals than advertised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\n\nThe BBC has reported\n that out of 665 Food Standards Agency  tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/freederrycorner.jpg","title":"trust apologises after pink free derry wall for organ donor

Thus, it is vital that everyone considers becoming a donor, registers as a potential donor and informs their next of kin of their decision to do so.

The first voice on air that day was Sir Laurence Olivier.\n\nProgrammes produced there The Kelly Show, School Around The Corner, Lesser Spotted Ulster, Counterpoint and Farming Ulster.\n\nIt was also used by television film crews around the world to process and edit film footage of the Troubles.\n\nBefore it was converted into a television studio, it was the site of a hemstitching warehouse.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the building provided a billet for troops who were tasked with providing protection for the city\u0027s numerous bridges.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"after a glimpse behind the scenes this week giving northern ireland more power is just unthinkable","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It would be hilarious but for the money involved and the questions it raises about competence, cronyism and ethical behaviour at the highest levels of government. \n\nWe had allegations that former minister Jonathan Bell had tried to break his spad\u0027s finger and swung a punch at him. We heard that his former spad Timothy Cairns told him \"Listen to me, big b***s\" during a row witnessed by senior civil servants. \n\nThere were lurid suggestions of sexual misconduct made about two of Mr Bell\u0027s ministerial colleagues. \n\nThere was evidence that Mr Bell was unable to adequately discharge his duties the morning after a late night in New York. \n\nThere were claims that Mr Cairns answered to other spads rather than his ministerial boss and that some of them had families who stood to gain from RHI. \n\nAll this, before we even consider Mr Bell alleging that the Executive\u0027s spin doctor David Gordon characterised him as a \"monster\" who needed to be put to sleep and that a senior journalist was advising the DUP about how to attack him. \n\nThe former permanent secretary of his department stated that colleagues at Invest NI had complained of Minister Bell\u0027s \"limited contribution to Northern Ireland\u0027s interests regarding foreign direct investment and trade\" and the risk of him \"making inappropriate or unhelpful comments\".\n\nAfter a trade delegation he was due to lead to the US on St Patrick\u0027s Day was dropped, it was further stated that he delayed providing routine information to OfM/DfM and travel authorisation for Invest NI staff out of pique. \n\nMost of those settling in to watch the live feed were expecting to hear a Northern Irish version of Yes Minister. What they got sounded more like a particularly fractious episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show with the DUP family at war. \n\nDuring the hearing it appeared that Mr Bell\u0027s memory of key events and grasp of detail is far from perfect, that he made secret recordings of conversations with civil servants and party colleagues, and that spads rather than he made key decisions. \n\nRegardless of the veracity of any of the claims, the rest of us are left wondering about the ethics and integrity of those who govern us. \n\nSadly, the civil service does not emerge well either. \n\nThe people running the RHI scheme appeared not to be able to spot basic flaws. The unit was under-resourced, no staff had specialist knowledge of a complex field and personnel changes meant that there was no continuity as the crisis unfolded. \n\nMost people will be shocked and bewildered by all of this. Of course, the media can distort and sensationalise stories. But this one gets worse if you follow the live coverage and read all the documents. \n\nWe have no government. But if and when we do, there is no case for dancing in the streets. \n\nCivil servants and ministers will have much to prove. We need to trust that civil servants have the competence to manage large budgets, ministers the ability to lead them, and that unelected party officials are controlled by ministers, not the other way around. Until that confidence is restored, providing Stormont with yet more power would be unthinkable. \n\nNick Garbutt runs Nick Garbutt PR\n"},{"url":null,"title":"prayer groups bid to use council chamber rejected","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

this week that the Revenue Commissioners were formulating plans with Government officials for full customs checks amid fears the EU and the UK will fail to reach an agreement.\n\nLeo Varadkar was speaking at the end of a parliamentary party meeting in Co Galway, on the same day as EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Theresa May’s Brexit plans were not acceptable to Brussels.\n\n\n\nThe direction we’ve given to Revenue is not to prepare for customs posts on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\nLeo Varadkar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“The direction we’ve given to Revenue is not to prepare for customs posts on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland because that’s something we’re not contemplating,” Mr Varadkar said.\n\nHe added: “If the Revenue Commissioners are in any way trying to put in any physical infrastructure then that is news to me and I really don’t believe that’s happening.”\n\nThe Taoiseach said it was important to make a distinction between the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and the ports, where the Government could not “countenance” a hard border being introduced, and airports, where custom controls may be needed if a pre-trade agreement was not reached with the UK.\n\nMr Varadkar said there would be an intensification in the next phase of the Brexit talks in the coming weeks and he hoped a deal would be made by the October deadline or by November at the latest.\n\nWhen it came to the common travel area, Mr Varadkar said he had no concerns.\n\n“I am confident that no matter what happens, the common travel area will remain in place because both UK and Ireland want that for each other’s citizens,” he said.\n\n“It benefits citizens in both countries and the European Union has taken the view that we can continue that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"secretary of states announcement of civil servant decisions is of greater significance","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

They\u0027ll soon be receiving a mere 25% more than the average UK salary for not turning up for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nKaren Bradley\u0027s belated adoption of the Reaney proposals for salary reduction offered an overdue response to farce.\n\nIt was also a minimal response - and one which simply ignored legislation which requires her to call an Assembly election. Such a contest would of course be pointless and possibly counter-productive - but it is the correct legal position, one usurped at ministerial whim. Of much greater significance than the cash crowd-pleaser was the Secretary of State\u0027s announcement of legislation to allow civil servants to take the decisions MLAs ought to be making.\n\nIndirect rule.\n\nIf I was a civil servant I\u0027d be asking for a cut of the £13,000 being taken from one of those poor MLAs. Civil servants will soon be effectively moonlighting as Executive ministers. And we all thought double-jobbing had ended.\n\nBradley\u0027s actions are an obvious attempt to keep Stormont open as a bit more than a tourist attraction.\n\nAllowing civil servants to make decisions avoids the dreaded direct rule label. It keeps alive the possibility of a return to devolved government until there really does have to be an election, in 2022. \n\nAnd even then, we could have a fantasy election to an Assembly that doesn\u0027t exist: 2003 all over again. Rule by civil service decree is profoundly undemocratic. Those elected by no-one will be making important decisions that affect everyone.\n\nGovernance transfers to the unelected and unaccountable. The main means of citizen redress will be via the courts. \u0027First Minister Sterling\u0027 - a job he does not seek and in which he ought not to be placed - will take decisions without democratic mandate.\n\nWhether the quality of civil service rule will improve matters is unclear. A fair chunk of the RHI evidence suggests a body struggling with the complexities of the legislation - even if it ought to have been mainly a cut-and-paste from the Westminster model - and failing to warn hapless ministers as trouble developed.\n\nIn its defence, the civil service appeared short-staffed and overworked - problems now multiplied several-fold by the Secretary of State\u0027s promise of more roles.\n\nThe costs of a full Assembly dissolution would be personal as well as political. When the Assembly was created in 1998-99, it was not the main source of livelihood for many MLAs. Few had expected its formation and many had other jobs.\n\nAfter years of relative stability from 2007-16, it has become the main source of income for most members .\n\nSo sympathy is due to those MLAs who are blameless in the institutional collapse and diligent in their constituency duties. As my Liverpool colleague Sean Haughey has shown in the Journal of Legislative Studies, MLAs spend a big proportion of their work  on constituency activity. \n\nThere\u0027s also much to be said for working from home. But when the university term starts, I wouldn\u0027t get 35p let alone £35K for long if I played truant. And members of a legislative assembly need to be just that.\n\nReducing salaries can concentrate minds but not change them. It may make MLAs thrifty with the weekly shopping but paying people £13,000 less will not alter their views on an Irish Language Act, same-sex marriage, abortion, Brexit, blame for RHI, whatever. \n\nUltimately political will not fiscal rectitude will determine the Assembly\u0027s future. There remains the strong suspicions that the DUP is, for now, comfortable with political arrangements - no worries for the DUP nine, erstwhile 10, given their prospering at Westminster - whilst Northern Ireland\u0027s institutions are not Sinn Fein\u0027s ultimate concern anyway.\n\nLogically, there is no reason why the Assembly cannot be reconstituted to deal with schools, hospitals and other matters, even if its members are still arguing over the dead-end of identity politics and wrestling over social issues. \n\nAn incremental way forward would be for the Assembly to revive but confine legislation initially to agreed ring-fenced issues - baby steps back to the full model. But don\u0027t expect anything prior to the RHI verdict anyway. \n\nPublic support for the Assembly - but not the current fake one - remains high, despite the cynicism over MLA pay. Credible immediate alternatives remain in short supply. \n\nDirect rule? Non-runner for nationalists. \n\nTransfer of powers to local councils? 11 mini-Stormonts. \n\nJoint authority or unity?

The October European Council has been slated as the occasion for agreement on the terms of Britain’s divorce from the EU and a statement on its future relations. However, with major differences remaining on key issues – including the Irish border – that is looking increasingly unlikely.\n\nNovember: Possible emergency summit if the October council fails to break the deadlock on the withdrawal agreement.\n\nDecember 13-14: The final EU summit of the year is widely seen as the last opportunity for agreement between Britain and the EU on a divorce deal, paving the way for a transition period following the UK’s departure.\n\n\n2019\n\n\nJanuary and February: The House of Commons will decide whether or not to support whatever deal the Government has reached with Brussels. Parliament must also pass a Withdrawal and Implementation Bill to establish the necessary legal framework.\n\nMarch: For a withdrawal agreement to take effect, it must be backed by a “super majority” of EU leaders, representing at least 20 of the 27 remaining member states and 65% of their population. It must also be approved by a vote of the European Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe European parliament area of Brussels \n\n\n\n\nMarch 29: Brexit day. At 11pm UK time – midnight in Brussels – Britain’s EU membership finally ends.\nIf there is a withdrawal agreement, it will mark the start of a 21-month transition period, ending in December 2020, during which the UK will continue to pay into the EU budget and follow EU rules. If not, there could be a more abrupt “cliff edge” departure.\n\n\n2020\n\n\nTalks could continue through the year on a free trade deal with the EU, assuming Brexit has been relatively amicable. The Government will also seek to negotiate trade deals with other countries around the world.\n\nDecember 31: The end of the transition period, coinciding with the end of the EU’s seven-year budget.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new national strategy for school libraries","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

spokesman for children and young people, said: “The strategy will be a valuable blueprint for all of those involved in developing and delivering school library services to ensure all children and

What’s interesting about Brand New Roman is that when you smash so many of these brands together they start to lose their powerful brand connotations in fascinating ways,” said Hello Velocity creative director Lukas Bentel.\n\n“The sheer density overrides all the extra brand identity associations each symbol usually carries.” \n\nWeirdly, working out which brand is responsible for each letter is part of the attraction in reading things written in Brands New Roman. \n\nAnd it takes on a whole new twist when the font is used to rewrite recognisable logos using the alternative lettering.\n\nFacebook is recreated with the Amazon A – complete with arrow – the Internet Explorer E, B from Beats and the Kellogg’s K.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther leading brands have been similarly redrafted.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In the end, I think that Brand New Roman is pretty aesthetically compelling, which makes sense given all the time, money and design that has gone into crafting each of these logos for the purposes of standing out,” added Bentel. \n\n“With Brand New Roman we are making them work together.” \n\nThe font has already been used to make a T-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo have a play around with font, visit the \nBrand New Roman\n website.\n\nSome letters change when combined with others, for instance a single o is different to a double oo. \n\nHello Velocity described the font building as a “time-intensive process”. \n\nIt had to cut some slack to find a logo which carried a recognisable standalone I. It opted for the capital version from IBM while the lowercase is taken from iomega – the predecessor of Lenovo. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"people share the cunning ways they have been duped by their pets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

His charmingly naïve character is the perfect contrast to the outrageous Derry girls, whose antics inevitably lead to mayhem wherever they go.\n\nThe show has already garnered the attention of the critics, picking up a string of awards including two Irish Film and TV Awards, an Edinburgh TV Award, and scooping the Radio Times Comedy Champion award. And the second series promises to be just as successful with its winning combination of cringe-inducing 90’s nostalgia and biting comedy.\n\nThe cast are now looking forward to getting back together in the coming weeks, having been caught up in the whirlwind of publicity surrounding the show. As an honorary Derry girl, Dylan has already been immersed in the local culture thanks to his co-stars, and is looking forward to his return to the city. Invited by Derry City and Strabane District Council to present this year’s Fashion Fest event, Dylan will have the opportunity to impress a whole host of Derry girls at the North West’s premiere fashion showcase event.\n\nWhile he admits he isn’t a quite style icon, the popular actor, who hails from Reigate, is already planning his outfit – but promises he won’t be out to steal the show.\n\n“I can’t wait to get back to Derry, I had such a good time when I was there filming with the cast and crew,” he insists. “I love Ireland and having the opportunity to spend some time there filming in Derry and Belfast has been a real experience.”\n\nWhen he first received the script for Derry Girls, Dylan says he just knew it was going to be big – but didn’t realise just quite how big. “When I read it I loved it right away, I thought it was hilarious,” he recalls. “I just knew when I was on set with the cast and crew that it was going to be something pretty special. But I didn’t think it would be breaking records to the extent that it is – I had thought we might pick up about 500k viewers – but not 2.5million. That’s just phenomenal.”\n\nThe cast and crew had the chance to travel round a number of locations in Derry and also Belfast where they had access to a studio. And Dylan managed to sample a bit of the famous local hospitality while he was here – but not too much he insists. “The girls did take me out a bit in Derry so I got to try out some of the local bars and the nightlife, and the local music – but I’m not a big drinker. I was very responsible I promise.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“The nightlife is just amazing over there, I really enjoyed it, and I’m looking forward to seeing a bit more when I get back. I absolutely love the banter and the Irish sense of humour, that’s what makes the place for me. The girls have all taken me to meet their families and made me feel really welcome.”\n\nHis character James certainly won’t be setting many trends but what about Dylan’s own style? The former Hollyoaks actor is quietly confident that he can hold his own at Fashion Fest. But he won’t be trying out any Blue Steel moves of his own.\n\n“I’m on it – but I would say I will play it safe and go for a nice suit on the night. I think fashion is all relative really – it’s all about your own perceptions. I quite like vintage styles myself, 50’s, 60’s era - nothing too loud. Though I do quite like a Hawaiian shirt. I’ve got quite a cool military jacket which I like and a nice Harrington jacket which is a bit James Dean. I like to keep things simple - I won’t be out to steal the show.”\n\nDerry Girls serves as a painful reminder of some of the fashion crazes we would all rather forget from the 90’s, with shell suits, crunchy perms and bomber jackets galore. In terms of his own fashion faux pas however Dylan has emerged virtually unscathed so far in the family photo album.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever worn anything I’m really ashamed of,” he admits. “I’m very partial to pink though, so I have worn pink shirts or pink jumpers which can be really hard to pull off. But I think I handled it,” he laughs.\n\n“This is my first official Fashion event so I’m really looking forward to it. Perhaps I’ll pick up a few tips while I’m there. Going from my past experiences out in Derry I know it will definitely be a great night out.”\n\nYou can catch up with Dylan Llewellyn at the Guildhall, where the Fashion Showcase event will be dazzling audiences with an array of classic and contemporary couture on October 13th, including a collection by celebrity stylist and esteemed fashion designer Kate Halfpenny. The London based designer counts celebrities such as Rihanna, Erin O Connor and Kate Moss among her clients and will be closing the show with her luxury brand Halfpenny London, showing pieces from her bridal collection as well as her \u0027Black Edit Collection\u0027.\n\nYou can find out more about Fashion Fest and purchase tickets for the event at \nwww.derrystrabane/fashionfest\n Follow us on Instagram @FashionFestDerry\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a man from llandrindod wells had his life saved twice in one month by the wales air ambulance in welshpool","story":"\nLeft to right: Pilot, James Benson, pictured alongside Critical Care Practitione\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtr Kate Humphries, Gr\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtant Withington and Critical Care Doctor Scott Farmery. \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8492487/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nA man from Llandrindod Wells had his life saved twice in one month by the Wales Air Ambulance\n\nGrant and his family visiting the Welshpool airbase.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date.

There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
