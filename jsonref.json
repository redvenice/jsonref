The Devon-based company told its customers that after holding its prices for two years, widespread cost pressures meant “reluctantly, we need to increase our prices”. Riverford delivers 80,000 veg boxes a week and this week’s changes mean a small seasonal veg box now costs 60p more, at £13.25, while a large fruit and veg delivery has risen £1.20 to £24.75. Rob Haward, Riverford’s managing director, said putting up its prices would enable it to ensure everyone in its supply chain was being treated fairly. The company has been employee-owned since 2018. Jonas Keck, economist at the CEBR economic consultancy, says: M\u0026ampC Saatchi’s biggest shareholder has proposed an all-share exchange merger with her acquisition vehicle, arguing that the deal would enable one of the biggest names in British advertising to become more digitally-led and better funded to seek out acquisitions. London-listed shell investment firm AdvancedAdvT, set up and run by M\u0026ampC Saatchi’s deputy chair Vin Murria, said on Friday that it is “interested in exploring a share merger between M\u0026ampC and the company”. Aston Martin warned today it would miss its annual profit target by about £15m after failing to deliver as many of its limited edition Valkyrie hypercar models to customers as planned. The British luxury car manufacturer said it had delivered 10 of the £2.5m vehicles in the fourth quarter, fewer than planned. “The impact is timing only, all Aston Martin Valkyrie Coupes are sold and remain allocated to customers with significant deposits,” the company said in a full-year trading update. Lawrence Stroll, the executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, said that the Valkyrie project had proved challenging since he inherited it when he led a consortium to buy the company in 2020. But the downtrend could be slow, given the pressures facing goods producers, Colijn adds: That would mean real wages (pay after inflation) remain under pressure, as earnings aren’t yet rising to keep pace with prices.Firms have been passing on their higher costs to consumers, with supply chain bottlenecks pushing up raw material costs and restricting product availability. Joe Sullivan, partner at MHA, says worker shortages are the top challenge for builders: Max Jones, director in Lloyds Bank’s infrastructure and construction team, agrees that that the surge in Covid-19 infections could hit builders: But there are signs that the supply chain crisis is easing, with fewer firms reporting disruption to deliveries. Data firm IHS Markit’s construction PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, dropped to 54.3 in December, down from 55.5 in November, showing the slowest growth since September.  House-building accelerated, but commercial property growth slowed and the civil engineering sector contracted. Some survey respondents noted that tighter pandemic restrictions and rising COVID-19 cases had acted as a brake on recovery, especially in the commercial sector. That could help ease the cost pressure hitting UK builders, with input price inflation slowing to its lowest in nine months.

I have some comments around the town saying ‘we are getting our club back’.” And they’ve sold 6,000 tickets for tomorrow’s tie.Cheikhou Kouyate, Jordan Ayew and Wilfried Zaha are absent on Africa Cup of Nations duty, but the Premier League club have no plans to rotate. “For me, it was always clear to put the best team on the field to compete,” Vieira said. “It is a derby, it is the FA Cup and it will be challenging. We will need our best starting XI to compete and to try to win the game.” Conor Gallagher will return at the Den but James McArthur (hamstring) remains absent. Vieira was coy over Palace’s transfer activity for this month, insisting Jean-Philippe Mateta “will be part of the group” for the Cup tie despite speculation linking him with a move to St Etienne. On reported interested in Eddie Nketiah and Aaron Ramsey, the manager added: “There is not much to say about those players because for us what is really important is to concentrate and focus on the players we have.”“Kieran hasn’t come for the financial benefits of the contract. He’s come for the club and for the challenge that the team faces at the current time, but also the longer-term vision, so I think that’s a massive thing for the football club. “Hopefully with his signing, other players around the world will potentially look at that and share his dream and his vision for what he sees. That’s a big thing for us.” Asked if he was confident about further signings, he replied: “Yes, I’d say at this moment I am. But we’re in the hands of clubs selling players, we’re in the hands of agents and players wanting to come. There are no guarantees. It might sound simple from the outside it’s very, very different when you’re on the inside, so I’m confident, but there are no promises.” The threat of relegation may not help Newcastle as they attempt to bolster their squad over the remaining weeks of the winter transfer window – Callum Wilson is due to undergo a scan to determine the extent of his calf injury which could yet impact on their plans – although Howe indicated his distaste for escape clauses in contracts.He said: “Offering relegation clauses is a sure-fire way to potentially bring players in who don’t have the correct motivation. I want players who are absolutely committed and have no way out, to say ‘I’ve got to make that work’, and that’s the only way we’re going to get success anyway.”Aubameyang tested positive on arrival in Cameroon on Thursday, along with his teammate Mario Lemina. They are now awaiting the results of PCR tests but both missed the country’s first training session on Friday.

Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"students in fee charging schools more likely to progress to courses with high points","story":"New data shows that almost all Leaving Cert students in fee-charging schools progressed to third-level institutions (99.7 per cent). Photograph: iStockStudents from fee-charging schools are significantly more likely to progress to high points college courses, according to data compiled by The .However, schools in disadvantaged areas – or Deis schools – have also performed strongly by sending high numbers of students to third level.The figures are contained in the annual  Feeder Schools supplement on Friday, which provides a school-by-school breakdown on the number of students who progressed to higher-level education in 2021.Last year’s Leaving Cert students were the first cohort to benefit from a choice of predicted grades and written exams.New data shows that almost all Leaving Cert students in fee-charging schools progressed to third-level institutions (99.7 per cent), up slightly (+1 per cent) from the previous year.Non-fee-charging schools also sent a large majority of students to college (80 per cent), down slightly (-3 per cent) on last year.In Deis schools more than half of Leaving Cert students went on to study in higher education (62 per cent). This was also down slightly (-2 per cent) on the previous year, but up significantly on 2019 (+5 per cent).Overall, these figures suggest that last year’s move to provide a choice between written exams and predicted grades proportionately benefited more students in fee-charging schools compared with 2020’s calculated grades model.Education authorities have not released national data on progression from schools to further education courses.When third-level progression rates are broken down to high points courses only, students in fee-charging schools fared particularly well with 87 per cent securing places in such programmes, up slightly on last year (+1 per cent).Among non-fee-charging schools the equivalent figure was 52 per cent (-1 per cent year-on-year) and 33 per cent among Deis schools (no change).The Feeder Schools data also provides a breakdown of college progression rates by postal district in the capital.These figures show evidence of a “class gap” in the proportion of students going on to college in different parts of the city.For example, third-level progression rates are highest in more affluent areas such as Dublin 6 (104 per cent), Dublin 14 (96 per cent), Dublin 2, 3, 4 (all 90 per cent).They were significantly lower in less affluent areas such as Dublin 11 (54 per cent), Dublin 10 (55 per cent) and Dublin 1 and 22 (both 57 per cent).When progression rates are broken down by county, Dublin ranks highest (90 per cent), followed by Clare (86 per cent) and Donegal (84 per cent).The lowest ranked counties were Kilkenny, Longford, (both 68 per cent), Meath (71 per cent) and Cavan (72 per cent).When Feeder School data is broken down by inidual school, it shows fee-charging schools account for almost half of the 20 schools with the highest progression rates to high points courses.Overall, the schools which sent the most students to third-level were: Christian Brothers College, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Salerno Secondary School, Salthill, Galway Loreto Abbey, Dalkey, Co Dublin Coláiste Muire, Ennis, Co Clare Coláiste Íde, Dingle, Co Kerry Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí, Tralee, Co Kerry St Mary’s Secondary School, Macroom, Co Cork The Teresian School, Dublin 4 St Gerard’s School, Bray, Co Wicklow and Loreto College, St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2.All these schools recorded progression rates in excess of 100 per cent, given that the numbers included students from previous years who deferred their applications.In any given year, about 20 per cent of students defer their applications to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: At what point birds dispersed and where they went seems to have escaped the recordStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"is it time we learned to live with covid 19","story":"Two years into the pandemic, it’s still not clear how, when, or if it will end.

Photograph: Tom HonanMichael Collins’s prophesy that the Anglo-Irish Treaty was a “stepping stone to freedom” has been fulfilled over the last century, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is expected to say.Mr Varadkar will give the keynote speech at a Fine Gael event on Friday evening to mark the centenary of the ratification of the Treaty.On January 7th, 1922 the Dáil ratified the Treaty by 64 votes to 57 prompting a walkout by Éamon de Valera and his supporters.The “stepping stone” theory was articulated during the Treaty debates by Collins on December 19th, 1921 when he said: “Now as one of the signatories of the document I naturally recommend its acceptance. I do not recommend it for more than it is. Equally I do not recommend it for less than it is. In my opinion it gives us freedom, not the ultimate freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it.”Mr Varadkar is likely to say that Collins’s vision has been vindicated in “so many different and extraordinary ways” starting with the 1922 constitution of the Irish Free State and the freedoms brought by the Statute of Westminster in 1931, Bunreacht na hÉireann in 1937 and the Republic of Ireland Act in 1948 which “were all made possible by the Treaty and built on it”.He will add: “On the international stage we made new treaties and agreements, each one giving new meaning to what had been achieved in 1921 and 1922. We joined the United Nations and became global citizens.”Fifty years ago this month Ireland signed the Treaty of Accession to the European Economic Community and joined following its ratification by the people in a referendum that summer.PraiseMr Varadkar will praise the 121 men and women who voted on the Treaty and did so in the knowledge that were taking on the gravest responsibility and that no outcome will be the perfect one.He is also likely to use the speech to criticise Sinn Féin’s take on the past. All the TDs who voted on the Treaty were Sinn Féin TDs and it was endorsed by a majority of them.“In the recent decades, other people have come to claim that particular political identity and branding and their own,” he will say.“They can do so only by ignoring every single historical fact that clashes with their carefully fabricated self-image. They appeal to the past, based on a falsification of history and claim a lineage that is not real.“Whenever the State succeeds, they seek to undermine it. Wherever there is hope, they sow despair. Whenever there are unpopular decisions to be made, they hide or blame others.”The centenary of the Treaty vote will be marked by the launch of a book entitled Men and Women of the Anglo-Irish Treaty Delegations 1921 at Kings Inn on Friday evening.RelativesIt has been compiled by and features the relatives of those who signed the Treaty in December 1921.It will be launched by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the British ambassador to Ireland Paul Johnson.On Friday evening RTÉ One will broadcast Treaty Live on January 7th – an event like Election 1918 that was presented by David McCullagh and Sinead O’Carroll.Treaty Live imagines how modern television might have reported this event. With panel contributions from leading historians and political scientists, Treaty Live blends the real-time story of the approval of the Treaty with an exploration of the previous decade in Irish politics and foreshadows Ireland’s future.The Minister for Culture Catherine Martin has announced that every local authority in the county will be given €50,000 to support their commemorative programme in 2022. She has also made a supplementary fund of €450,000 available to provide further supports to local authorities who have identified additional requirements in relation to specific centenaries of local significance.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the first step on a new path what the irish times thought of the treaty vote","story":"Reports on the vote in The  on January 9th, 1922On January 7th, 1922, the Dáil voted in favour of the Anglo Irish Treaty, signed the previous month in London, by a margin of 64 votes to 57.The edition carrying the first reports of the “enthusiastic ratification scenes” appeared the following Monday, on January 9th. The main coverage was published on page five, as it would be nearly 20 years before news stories appeared regularly on the front page of The  – with the exception of the Weekly edition.Reports on the Monday following the vote included the views of the world press details of Arthur Griffith’s speech Éamon de Valera’s declaration that an opportunity had been “lost definitely” and the final dramatic scenes in the Dáil as the vote was taken: “few were prepared for the dramatic climax that lay in store”.The same edition also carried the first editorial comment from The  following the vote – the piece can be read in full below:, January 9th, 1922Dáil Éireann has ratified the Articles of the Agreement between Great Britain and Ireland. Technically, the country’s fate has been decided by the narrow majority of seven votes. Actually the decision expresses the will of at least nine-tenths of the Irish people. They made up their minds on the day when the plenipotentiaries brought the Treaty back from London and their choice has been confirmed rather than shaken by the prolonged discussions in the Dáil. We can respect the sincerity of the advocates of an Irish Republic. We can sympathize with Mr de Valera’s honest and, no doubt, unselfish sorrow in defeat but no man or party of men has any right to sacrifice a Nation’s welfare to the pursuit of an ideal.We assume that the parliament of Southern Ireland will be summoned without delay, will ratify the Treaty formally, and will appoint the Provisional Government which will “carry on” until the Irish Free State has been established. Mr Arthur Griffith and Mr Michael Collins have dominated the proceedings in the Dáil. They will be leading members of the Provisional Government, and they have given the country some reason to hope that they will take up their new task with a solemn sense of their responsibilities to all parties and classes in Southern Ireland. We shall not speculate on the developments which must come crowding on the heels of the Dáil’s decision.Much will depend on the attitude of Mr de Valera and his followers. He declared on Saturday evening, and again yesterday, that the Irish Republic would remain in being until the Irish people had disestablished it. If this phrase means merely that Mr de Valera will refuse to recognise the Treaty and will advise his supporters to take no active part in administering it until a general election has confirmed the country’s allegiance to it, we can afford to wait for that certain and early confirmation.For the present we decline to believe that any dissatisfied Republican will seek to vent his dissatisfaction by inflicting further unrest or misery on his fellow countrymen. Any conflict in Ireland now must be civil conflict between Irishmen and Irishmen. Mr de Valera has fought strenuously for his convictions, and he has been defeated. If he is a true patriot, he will bow to the national decision and, if he cannot help, at least will not hinder the work of the new Administration. The fifty-seven deputies who voted against the Treaty have made their protest. We hope that, having made it, they will be ready now to fulfil the wishes of their constituents.We speak for the vast majority of Southern loyalists when we say that they are ready to take Mr Arthur Griffith at his word. They face the future with anxious hearts. All their old landmarks have disappeared. They have reached a point where they must break with traditions that were very dear to them. They are forced to adjust their minds to an entirely new set of ideals and ideas. They are invited to launch the ship of their hopes and fortunes upon an uncharted sea. For the moment, at any rate, a wide gap seems to ide them from all the Imperial institutions which they still honour and have helped to build.To one article of faith, however, they continue to fix an unshaken mind. Ireland is their country and her future must be their future. The talk of a sort of Babylonian exodus, in which some well-meaning Englishmen have indulged, has irritated them. If they must make a new start, they prefer to make it in their own land. We attach little importance to Mr Griffith’s promise that, so far as he can have his way, all minorities will get fair play and full consideration in the Irish State. We believe that Mr Griffith speaks for virtually the whole of Nationalist Ireland, which realises that by this road only can the goal of true unity be reached. The Southern loyalists will do their best to make the new settlement a success. They demand only an equality of opportunity and they ask for no confidence which they are not prepared to earn.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"venues and artists to receive new supports from spring","story":"Minister for Culture and Arts Catherine Martin said she is progressing a scheme to support venues such as pubs, clubs and cafés to trial new events and activities at night which would also create new employment opportunities for artists.

That consultation, I guess, would really examine how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol. “We know that it’s a key ask from the sector but the consultation is essential because we must bring the people with us as well.”A new pilot scheme which will provide a basic income for artists will also open in either February or March, she indicated.“This is really a once in a generation landmark moment for the arts and I’m determined to see it through and see it. It won’t be based on a means test, it will be a non-competitive process. It will be available for as broad a range as possible those work for the arts.”She said artists have sought a €325 weekly payment. The Government is still finalising the figure, she said adding: “I would expect it to be close to that.”Separately, Ms Martin also said that the recruitment process for a new online safety commissioner will begin in the new year, as part of plans to publish the new Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. It could take up to six months to finalise the appointment as the recruitment is happening through the public appointments service process.“The single most important aspect of this legislation is that it will establish a new regulator which will have substantial powers to hold the platforms to accounts in terms of how their systems work, including how they handle complaints.“There will be an online safety commissioner who will introduce binding codes… this will really be the first time that platforms will be held accountable for how they handle harmful content, such as cyber bullying.Meanwhile, the Future of Media Commission has furnished its report to Government. She said she will meet with Taoiseach Micheál Martin shortly to discuss its findings."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Young Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bristol became front line wokery","story":"If ever a place was entitled to be considered the woke capital of Britain, it surely would be Bristol. From independent mayors and local currencies to vintage stores and radical street art, this is an urban community which packs a hefty punch of street cred, all wrapped up in architecture that could take the stoniest heart and make it weep with joy.Welcome to the frontline of the culture wars, a place where past and present attitudes smash together like atoms in the Hadron Collider. On Wednesday, that reputation was solidified by the acquittal of four young Bristolians for pulling down the statue of their long-dead fellow citizen Edward Colston, on June 7 2020, as part of a Black Lives Matter protest. That the verdict was greeted with some dismay outside Bristol was irrelevant. Locals were pleased. On the streets, there was cheering and applause.  Many of us would like to live in a community as tight-knit and supportive as this, whether we warm to statues being thrown into docks or not. You don’t have to approve of cancel culture to think social cohesion and a bit of harmony is a good thing. Which leads to the fascinating question of whether Bristol’s current tolerant, sunny and villagey feel is the direct result of those times it is most ashamed of. Can it be that the real legacy of Colston is not in those those civic buildings he lavished thousands of pounds on – paid for with the trafficking of more than 84,000 slaves?Instead, might it be a collective, unconscious but genuine sense of citizenship which might not otherwise have existed? Colston’s lack of humanity – 19,000 black men, women and children are estimated to have died aboard his slave ships – may have engendered the opposite emotion in subsequent generations, an epigenetic flowering of compassion and fellowship.  Certainly, views on the court case itself differ: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has vowed to close a loophole he says exists in the law around memorials which allowed the acquittal of the four. Other MPs have criticised the verdict. Yet Jacob Rees-Mogg – a North Somerset man, of course – has taken this chance to point out that juries are “the great sublime protector of liberties”. You can take a man out of Bristol – by eco-friendly train, please, from Temple Meads – but not the Bristolian sensibility.  Yet even as the Good Life flourishes by the river Avon – the Soil Association, Triodos Bank and the Environment Agency all have their HQs here – is everything in Bristol really so rosy? Yesterday former mayor, Independent George Ferguson, was warning that the city was facing an existential threat in the form of over-development. That laidback, friendly lifestyle is attracting more investment and, as it does, Ferguson warned: “The city’s history and special character and environment are under attack from more damaging development than we have experienced in the past 50 years, but we are in danger of sleepwalking through it.”An architect by trade, Ferguson warned of a resurgence of “egotistical high building development”, pleading for “the good sense” of creating elegant streets and spaces that are the stuff of great European cities, and promising to “fight like hell for Bristol.”Nor is the city without social problems. A 2019 report looking at sewage and wastewater found it to be the cocaine capital of Europe.Moreover, a survey by Currys PC World and Ring Security last summer found that Bristol was only 36th out of 50 when it came to affordable UK cities, ranking 30th for safety and 22nd for work-life balance. It only manages 29th place for greenery, which seems particularly disappointing. Worse, according to town review website I Live Here, many of the accolades are myth. “What is really happening is that the posher areas such as Clifton are becoming even posher, trendier and less attainable for the ‘lower’ classes, whilst other places on the outskirts continue to decline,” says one poster. “Some advice to Bristol: Graffiti, expensive sandwiches and hordes of smelly hippies do not a pleasant city make.”Those hippies may well be Trustafarians too, still wearing the clothes they backpacked across Indonesia in, now studying history at the university with plans to work in the City later.I know myself only too well how intertwined past and present, Georgian terraces and lanky white youths with dreadlocks, are in the city, having been to school there in the 1970s and 1980s. Every school day for seven years I would cross the gently creaking Clifton Suspension Bridge with my mother, who would drop me at the high school and then drive to the comprehensive school where she taught: Lockleaze, just south of Filton. My friends and I roamed Clifton and Redlands, as far as the Gloucester Road – now the trendiest shopping and eating street, but then distinctly unsalubrious. We’d walk down the steep hill of Park Street, ending up at Broadmead shopping centre to shop at Snob and go for cocktails at the floating pub in the docks, Lochiel.The laid-back vibe was at near structural levels. Lunchtimes would be spent haunting the antiques market where fox stoles – head still attached – jostled next to long silk dressing gowns, owned once a time by elderly gentlemen who lived in the large houses on the Downs. Mothers dressed in long skirts, and shared yoghurt recipes. In my memory, Clifton forever smells of coffee roasting at Carwardines –much as it might have done in the 1920s – and patchouli-scented joss sticks imported from India. As a teenager, I had friends at Colston Girls’ school (now Montpelier High School) and sang with a choir at the Colston Hall – the Bristol Beacon since 2020. We took barge trips around the docks to look at the giant tobacco warehouses and to see the SS Great Britain. Trade and slavery were taught in history lessons because their story was all around us, in the museums as well as events such as the St Paul’s riots in 1980. And then there were the street names (although the infamous Blackboy Hill and Whiteladies Road are both unlikely to be connected to slavery, local historians say). Yet other roads commemorate other traders whose heirs in the form of The Society of Merchant Venturers (SMV) have been left with the isive, deeply painful work of unpicking what Bristol as a whole owes to the slave trade in the 18th century. The society notes that it is likely most of its members, along with the great majority of Bristol’s citizens, would have profited indirectly from the trade. For example, through shipbuilding provisioning supplies to the ships involved the processing of slave-produced commodities such as sugar and tobacco the production of commodities used in the purchase of slaves, especially brass the ownership of interests in plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas or through the banks that financed both trade and manufacturing.Perhaps the only answer to that terrible truth in the past is for Bristol to have become as gloriously tolerant in its modern existence as possible. The alternative is unthinkable.Or is there a last clue to the city\u0027s chilled out demeanour in those other names which adorn it – not on the buildings or in stained glass windows – but on the celebratory blue plaques. For among the suffragists and chartists, the anti-slavery campaigners and opera singers, can be found actor Michael Redgrave, social reformer Hannah More, politician Ernest Bevin, wicketkeeper Jack Board, nobel laureate Paul Dirac and Nipper the HMV dog.It’s a city of legends, Bristol, a lucky dip where anything goes and, wokester or not, everyone\u0027s welcome. Within reason. More from NewsCovid latest news: Army deployed at London hospitals as NHS staff absences surge 60 per cent in a weekPolitics latest news: Minister defends plans for tax rises despite cost-of-living crisisDiscovered: Covid \u0026#39trust threshold\u0026#39 where restrictions do not work - and UK is on the cuspBoy, 13, arrested on suspicion of murder after Polish man stabbed in west LondonNovak Djokovic \u0026#39free to leave at any time\u0026#39 says CanberraKazakhstan president orders troops to shoot-to-kill \u0026#39without warning\u0026#39 as fresh gunfire heard in biggest cityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid tests should need benefit readers weeks biggest stories","story":"This week, Covid testing rules have been relaxed as part of efforts to shorten isolation periods and ease the staffing shortages crippling Britain. This comes as more than 20 NHS hospital trusts have declared critical incidents.  readers debated the current rules for testing and discussed whether or not they are still beneficial.Ahead of the return to school this week, our readers shared their thoughts on Covid restrictions in schools after plans to force secondary pupils to wear face masks were hit by a backlash from various authorities on Sunday night. Readers stressed the danger of potential mental health issues that could result from this rule.Read on to find out what our readers had to say about these stories and the week\u0027s biggest talking points.Millions of people who test positive on lateral flow devices will be told they do not need to take follow-up PCR tests, which currently delay the official start of isolation for hundreds of thousands. Readers argued that testing should solely be for those who are vulnerable in hospital or care home environments.@Louis Hill:The more you test, the more you find, the more people are off work. The vulnerable are vaccinated - time to get on with our lives and stop looking for problems.@Balanced View:Testing needs to be dropped immediately for everyone apart from those that actually need it and benefit from it. Anyone in care home settings including staff and visitors, hospital staff and incoming patients and anyone caring for vulnerable groups.For anyone else, this is simply a waste of valuable resources that are actually helping in some settings. But the example of Teachers Unions demanding they test all pupils and staff daily borders on the ridiculously hysterical, which has sadly been too much a feature of the entire pandemic.@Hazel Fleming:We should simply not be testing - we need to treat Covid like the common cold now. Dropping self-isolation from seven to five days is not good enough. Stop self-isolation all together. If people are too ill to go to work, they stay home. If they are able, they go to work. It is just common sense.Due to figures showing a fall in the number of new Covid cases, Tory MP’s, a government scientific adviser, charities and parents’ groups united in calling for restrictions to be balanced against the risk of the virus. By emphasising the minimal risk the virus has on children, readers believe plans to force children to wear face masks in school would cause more harm than good.@Jennie Cummings-Knight:Children have indeed suffered and continue to suffer with fear. As a therapist, I have heard stories from parents of children utterly terrified by hearing adult discussion about potential risks unsuitable for children. The psychological implications of children being forced to wear face masks never seem to be considered, and yet mental health is at least as important as physical health.@Linda Hill:Anything that allows children to learn, plus socialise and mix with friends has got to be a good thing.We cannot put these poor children into another round of homeschooling. It is not good for their education nor their physical or mental health.I am a teacher and I am against students being forced to wear masks in lessons. It affects the quality of teaching and learning. When students respond to questions wearing a mask I can’t understand what they are saying. It’s totally unnecessary and I’m pleased there has been a backlash against the measure. Young children and adolescents have been through enough. Time to return to normal.Writing for The  this week, Charles Moore argued in support of Mr Blair’s knighthood. Mr Moore believes that Mr Blair’s success as Labour leader and the fact that the Queen approves of the knighthood, should be enough of a justification for the rest of us. Our readers took to the comments to share their thoughts on the decision.Tony Blair was successful because the Conservatives were so poor and he took over some parts of Tory progress like Northern Ireland when they were virtually done and successful. It was clear after the first Labour Government, Tony Blair was behaving in a disgraceful way and by the time of his third win, his Party knew it was a matter of time before he was removed.When he finally left No.10, he was hated by Labour and the country. He was rumbled, and his previous decisions, revealed as dreaded mistakes like immigration, for example. He was a failed politician, and to suggest he deserves this honour because of the first term is derisory. In that year he took the UK to war under false evidence.Mr Blair deserves his ridicule today and does not deserve this award simply because he was better than the Conservatives at persuasion.I fully agree with Mr Moore on this occasion. Tony Blair did many good things for the country and won three election victories and should have been rewarded with a knighthood a long time ago, especially as he declined the automatic offer of a peerage that all former PM\u0027s get when they leave the Commons. There were many of his policies that I didn\u0027t support, but overall he left the UK in a far better state than he found it, despite (as with all PMs) being bombarded by multiple issues in a job that has evolved to become ridiculously complex for any one person to do in its current form. Many nations took part in the war against the murderous tyrant in Iraq and even if Mr Blair made some wrong decisions, that is what sometimes happens at the highest level when leaders are under multiple pressures.I don\u0027t agree with much that Tony Blair did, and I could point to a number of critical errors. If it was up to me, he wouldn\u0027t receive a knighthood. But I will defend Her Majesty\u0027s right to appoint whomever she sees fit to the Order of the Garter, particularly if, as I suspect, it is as much about respecting the office he held as it is the inidual.Ben Marlow, our Chief City Commentator, wrote this week that 2022 is the year when reality should finally match all the hype of Brexit, in order for it not to be declared as a historic failure.  readers countered Mr Marlow’s argument by explaining the benefits of Brexit and why they are yet to be completely fulfilled.You seem to miss the main point of Brexit. The restoration of our sovereignty. That it might take some months or even some years to fully comprehend the benefits is no surprise, but meanwhile and above all, we are free from the EU puppet show they like to call a Parliament.The greatest triumph of Brexit will always be the expression of democracy that was delivered one day, some five years ago.The extent of economic damage from Brexit has been made clear by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which predicts that leaving the EU will reduce our long-term GDP by around 4 per cent, compared to a fall of around 1.5 per cent that will be caused by the pandemic.Rather than boosting our trade, Brexit is holding it back. Goods exports were down year on year in the third quarter of 2021 according to the Office for National Statistics, with both exports to the EU and non-EU destinations suffering.Many Remain voters have never bothered to understand the motivation of many or most Leave voters, which was always plain enough namely, accountable Government. The electorate can throw out one Government and replace it with another and it will actually mean something.We will not be a mere satrap of a supranational technocracy which is immune to public opinion. A few billion pounds here or there cannot tilt the scales.Dr Megan Rossi argues that taking care of ourselves with a varied, fibre-rich diet is key for improving our gut health.  readers joined Dr Rossi in discussing how we can change our diets to boost our health.The best thing I have done of late is give up gluten. I don’t eat bread at all any more and I have a lovely satisfying breakfast of organic gluten-free porridge oats plus fruit and a sprinkling of chia seeds. I wasn’t celiac, but I feel so much better without gluten and my gut is much happier by far.@Moirelyn Jewula:For many years, I’ve been making big batches of soup in my pressure cooker with about ten vegetables in. Then using a hand blender I partially blend it, leaving plenty of vegetable chunks in it. I also add a handful of quinoa or bulgur wheat or lentils so that I’m eating more ancient grains. I use different vegetables, spices and herbs, garlic, ginger, chillies, etc, depending on the flavours I want. Whenever I have a bowl of this with some sourdough toast, I can feel it doing me good. “For breakfast I’ve been having muesli with extra nuts, banana, grapes, strawberries or whatever is in season, for over 45 years and I still love the complex flavours. There is a blueberry kefir that is great for the gut and is even more delicious with a few fresh blueberries andor red or black grapes thrown in.Towards the end of my career when, for various reasons, I was very stressed, I was having a great deal of discomfort and even pain in my gut. Since having the soups and kefir five years ago, I’ve not had problems.@Jane Seccombe:I lost a lot of weight after I retired in 2019, but most importantly, I have kept it off — I credit a big increase in my intake and variety of veggies, salad and fruit.

Two polls at the weekend are causing the alarm. One puts Labour 16 per cent ahead in those key seats that Boris Johnson would need to retain to win the next general election. And a constituency poll shows there is a new threat to the Right of Johnson\u0027s Conservative Party.  Some will argue that these are standard midterm problems and that a couple of polls mean little. But the data suggests that on the ground, something significant is happening which has, as yet, gone unnoticed in London. A revolt on the Right is brewing, and it poses a huge threat to the Prime Minister. This has happened before. Exactly ten years ago, I campaigned in the Barnsley Central by-election as Ukip leader. This urban South Yorkshire seat is rock solid Labour territory. Ukip barely got a mention in the polls or in media coverage of the campaign. On the stump, however, I became aware of a shift taking place. When the results were announced, Ukip came second with 12 per cent of the vote. The Tories trailed in third. Nine months earlier, at the 2010 election, Ukip had come fifth in that seat. That by-election marked the beginning of the insurgency that led to the EU referendum and the ousting of David Cameron from Downing Street. The latest constituency poll by Focal Data puts Reform UK, led by Richard Tice, at 15 per cent in Barnsley Central. A similar pattern is being repeated across many of the Red Wall seats, with Reform UK in double digits elsewhere in those key seats. Support is being built without the party spending lots of money or devoting many resources to publicity. It is the attraction of Reform UK’s policies rather than any enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party that is putting the Tories in such peril. There now exists a very mobile electorate in Red Wall areas. A decade ago, I met lifelong Labour Party voters who were for the first time willing to switch their support to Ukip, believing we spoke their language on the key issues of EU membership, immigration and patriotic pride. At the 2019 European elections, they switched again in increasing numbers, choosing to back the Brexit Party. And they switched for a third time later that year when the general election was held, voting for the Conservative Party. Once the generational link with the Labour Party was broken, switching became easy.  People lent their vote to Johnson in 2019 to break the Brexit logjam and to take back control of our borders because the immigration issue still matters to them. Yet just two years on, the volume of illegal Channel crossings has enraged these voters. The North East now houses 17 times as many asylum seekers as the South East, according to the Migration Observatory. The impact of this is plain for all to see. As the council house waiting list lengthens, there is a growing feeling that Johnson told voters what they wanted to hear about “taking back control” without really meaning it.   Such perceptions are electorally disastrous for any prime minister. Yet there is potentially an even bigger problem on the horizon. This year\u0027s massively increased gas and electricity bills are going to cause an enormous shock. Worse still, these large bills will coincide with tax rises. If Richard Tice can get the message through that 25 per cent of people\u0027s electricity bills is spent on green subsidies – and that the 5 per cent VAT energy rate has, despite promises, not been removed – then Reform UK will have its big chance.   The revolt on the Right ended the premierships of David Cameron and Theresa May. I founded Reform UK out of the Brexit Party, which had done its job successfully. For now, I am the party\u0027s president in a non-executive role, but I intend to increase the help that I\u0027m giving to Richard Tice. Brexit has not been completed properly. The net zero strategy is placing our nation at a significant disadvantage. And the Channel crossings are humiliating Britain.   I understand the disillusionment of Red Wall voters who thought Brexit would usher in a new politics. This has not happened. It’s just more of the same – a metropolitan Tory chumocracy totally detached from the rest of the country. If Johnson wakes up to this, he can still save himself. I suspect, however, that the revolt on the right will cause another prime ministerial casualty.  Listen to Nigel Farage on this subject on this week\u0027s Chopper\u0027s Politics, The \u0027s weekly political podcast, using the audio player at the top of this article or on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favourite podcast app.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Minister defends plans for tax rises despite cost-of-living crisisCovid latest news: Army deployed at London hospitals as NHS staff absences surge 60 per cent in a weekDiscovered: Covid \u0026#39trust threshold\u0026#39 where restrictions do not work - and UK is on the cuspBoy, 13, arrested on suspicion of murder after Polish man stabbed in west LondonNovak Djokovic \u0026#39free to leave at any time\u0026#39 says CanberraKazakhstan president orders troops to shoot-to-kill \u0026#39without warning\u0026#39 as fresh gunfire heard in biggest cityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west looks putin crushes kazakhstans democratic uprising","story":"Two statues toppled, two worlds apart. In Bristol, a jury acquits protesters who vandalised a monument to Edward Colston, an 18th-century philanthropist whose fortune was built on the slave trade. In Kazakhstan, a huge effigy of the dictator Nursan Nazabayev is torn down by demonstrators engaged in a fight to the death between people power and a police state.Here in Britain, arguments over statues are about who owns the past. In this oil-rich yet dirt-poor Central Asian republic, the battles are very much about the present. This is a popular uprising against the brutal, corrupt and authoritarian elite that has ruled Kazakhstan since the fall of the Soviet Union. They fled to Moscow by private jet as protesters died in the streets.As if to underline the geopolitical significance of the Kazak revolution, Russian airborne forces poured in to support the regime, now led by President Tokayev. He appealed for help to crush “international terrorists”, although it seems clear that protests in the capital, Almaty, and elsewhere were sparked by a dramatic rise in petrol prices. In Kazakhstan, even more than in the West, the politics of energy are explosive. In this vast land of just 19 million people that stretches from the Caspian Sea to China, transport is crucial and average monthly wages are just £400. Clashes have been reported all over the country, as simmering resentment of the Communist Party and its 81-year-old leader, Nazabayev, boiled over this week.All indications are that the revolution caught Vladimir Putin off guard, but he has been quick to order military intervention by the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CTSO), a bloc of six post-Soviet states led by Moscow. It is unclear how large this “peacekeeping” operation will be, but it comes at a time when the Kremlin has been engaged in a poker game with the West over Ukraine. With a large Russian army massed on the Ukrainian border, Putin issued an ultimatum last month, demanding that the United States not only keep out of any conflict but also withdraw its forces from other Nato members such as Poland and the Baltic states. While the crisis in Kazakhstan may delay any Russian invasion of Ukraine, it also exposes the weakness of the West. It looks very much as if we will be forced to watch helplessly as a democratic uprising is crushed by military force. Unlike Ukraine, Kazakhstan has hitherto been very much within the Russian sphere of influence. There are no limits on the harsh measures that may now be deployed. Putin has form in dealing with Muslim rebels. Up to 250,000 civilians may have died in the long war he fought in Chechnya from 1999 to 2009, which left the Caucasian republic in ruins.On the other side of the border, the world’s other leading authoritarian power, China, is watching anxiously to secure its oil supplies. Beijing is, like Moscow, hypersensitive to any potential Islamist threat. The Kazak population is overwhelmingly Muslim, as is China’s Xinjiang province, where mass incarceration and sterilisation have brought accusations of genocide. President Xi Jinping has recently replaced Xinjiang’s governor, but events in Kazakhstan will almost certainly prompt him to ignore foreign protests and instead reinforce China’s repressive policies against its own Muslims.Kazakhstan’s may be only the first authoritarian regime to collapse under the impact of the global energy crisis. Hence Putin will be at pains to send an unambiguous message to Washington and London: don’t even think about getting involved. After the humiliation of Afghanistan, President Biden will not dare to offer more than verbal support for the Kazak revolutionaries.As for Ukraine: the images of toppled statues in Kazakhstan may evoke memories of the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 uprising in Kyiv’s Maidan Square. If, however, these images are soon succeeded by reports of Kazak protesters imprisoned, tortured or shot, Ukrainians will be in no doubt of the fate that awaits them in the event of a successful Russian invasion. Kazakhstan may seem to us to be a far away country of which we know even less than we did when Neville Chamberlain used that notorious phrase about Czechoslovakia. But this week’s political earthquake there will reverberate around our interconnected world, as heads and hearts are broken in the increasingly desperate struggle between democracy and despotism. Those who cheer on Black Lives Matter activists protesting about centuries-old grievances might ask themselves: do Kazak lives matter too?Daniel Johnson is the editor of TheArticle.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Minister defends plans for tax rises despite cost-of-living crisisCovid latest news: Army deployed at London hospitals as NHS staff absences surge 60 per cent in a weekDiscovered: Covid \u0026#39trust threshold\u0026#39 where restrictions do not work - and UK is on the cuspBoy, 13, arrested on suspicion of murder after Polish man stabbed in west LondonNovak Djokovic \u0026#39free to leave at any time\u0026#39 says CanberraKazakhstan president orders troops to shoot-to-kill \u0026#39without warning\u0026#39 as fresh gunfire heard in biggest cityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Despite Lord Geidt clearing Mr Johnson, here are the big questions that remainBoris Johnson and Carrie, who oversaw the lavish renovation Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByMikey SmithWhitehall CorrespondentDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsBoris Johnson faces more serious questions over his Downing Street flat refurbishment after a furious letter from his ethics chief revealed explosive new text messages. The aposmissingapos messages reveal Mr Johnson had declared the luxury flat above Number  a bit of a tip - and asked Lord Brownlow to release more donor cash for a lavish, £, designer refurbishment. And they reveal the PM promised the Lord Brownlow he would consider at his plan for a second “Great Exhibition”. Labour said the exchange appeared to be “corruption, plain and simple.”While Lord Brownlow gave the messages to an Electoral Commission probe into the funding of the makeover, they were withheld from Lord Geidt - his advisor on the ministerial code. In a scorching letter, Lord Geidt said the failure to provide him with the texts was “plainly unsatisfactory, demonstrated insufficient respect and presented a threat to public confidence in his job. And while he doesn’t think the texts are a smoking gun proving Mr Johnson broke the rules over the cash, Lord Geidt said his report into the scandal would have been dferenthe’d known about them. Meanwhile, Downing Street was forced to deny Mr Johnson had agreed to look into Lord Brownlow’s plan for a “Great Exhibition .” because of the cash.  The PM’s deputy spokesman insisted the idea was “not taken forward.” But official records show then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden met with Lord Brownlow to discuss the project in January last year , just months after the texts. And the PM’s spokesman was unable to explain the dference between Lord Brownlow’s “Great Exhibition” idea, and the ‘Festival of the UK’ planned for later this year. Angela Rayner, Labouraposs deputy leader, said: It appears that Lord Brownlow had access to the Prime Minister and Culture Secretary because he was paying for his luxury flat renovations.“It is pretty unbelievable that Boris Johnson didn’t know who was paying for his luxury flat renovations.If so, that is corruption plain and simple. No one should be able to buy access or exchange wallpaper for festivals. Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer.” In May, Lord Geidt ruled that Mr Johnson had unwisely allowed the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat at No  to go ahead without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded. But he concluded there had been no conflict of interest or breach of the Ministerial Code. He wrote that the PM had assured him that “at no point the eight months until late February , as media reports were emerging, was the prime minister made aware of either the fact or the method of the costs of refurbishing the apartment having been paid.” But after the messages were revealed, he wrote to Mr Johnson: “Had I been aware of the Missing Exchange, I would have had further questions and drawn attention to it in my report. “More crucially, I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualication, what is set out in paragraph  of my report, that ‘at the point when the Prime Minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice’.” Lord Geidt told the Prime Minister of his grave concern that the missing messages were not provided to him when he was investigating how the flat redecoration was funded, or when Mr Johnsonaposs old phone - where the messages were stored - was accessed in June last year for another purpose. And he said the incident had shook his confidence. No refused to explain why the PM’s old phone could not be searched for Lord Geidt’s inquiry, when it was subsequently accessed over a “security” matter. Mr Johnson said he offered a humble and sincere apology but that he did not recall the exchange with Tory donor and peer Lord Brownlow. The letters reveal the Cabinet Office blocked Lord Brownlow from sharing the texts with Lord Geidt at the same time as providing them to the Electoral Commission’s inquiry. In his reply to Lord Geidt in December, the PM claimed the Cabinet Office had decided it was not appropriate to share them with him, because they were subject to an ongoing investigation. But Mr Johnson accepted it was unacceptable that the Cabinet Office did not at least make Lord Geidt aware that they existed. So what is the row all about and what are the biggest red flags in the report  Here’s what you need to know. First, a potted historyWhat’s the row all about The PM’s we Carrie oversaw a redecoration in the four-bed living space above  Downing Street - traditionally used by PMs as it is bigger and more luxurious than the two-bed flat above No. The makeover by designer Lulu Lytle is said to have included £-a-roll wallpaper, a £, Baby Bear sofa and a £, Lily Drum table. It cost more than £,.Who paid the bill It’s complicated. Boris Johnson originally assumed a charitable trust, led by Tory donor Lord Brownlow, would fund the work. But no such trust existed, and the idea then fell through due to legal concerns. So Lord Brownlow coughed up £,, himself.After a media storm, the PM later settled the full amount himself” - effectively paying back Lord Brownlow and theConservative Party , who’d handled some of the money.A further £, of a £k annual allowance from taxpayers was spent on Downing Street refurbishment, but it’s unclear whether it was for the flat. What is the newly-revealed exchange  Downing Street has published a “lost” WhatsApp message thatBoris Johnsonsent Lord Brownlow begging for cash.The PM wrote in November : “I am afraid parts of our flat are still a bit of a tip and am keen to allow Lulu Lytle to get on with it. Can I possibly ask her to get in touch with you for approvals ” Lord Brownlow replied, saying: “As the Trust isn’t set up yetapproval is a doddle as it’s only me and I know where the £ will come from.” The PM failed to inform his own ethics advisor about the message. Instead he claimed he only knew the source of the money three months later. Yet the PM escaped sanction after claiming the message was on his old phone, which he had to ditch after it emerged his number had been online for more than a decade.Why were the Tories fined  The Conservative Party was fined £, by the Electoral Commission in December for breaching electoral law over the way the money was recorded.A £k loan from Lord Brownlow included £,. to pay for revamping the flat. But Tory chiefs left that crucial £,. out of public records. Questions were asked by a junior staffer in the Tory treasurer’s office. But a senior fundraising officer told them the £k was for “something …don’t worry.” The unanswered questions for Boris Johnson Why wasnapost Lord Geidt given access to the PMaposs old phone  During his inquiry, Boris Johnsonaposs office told Lord Geidt his old phone was not accessible - heaposd been forced to change it after his number was revealed online.But Lord Geidtaposs letter reveals the phone was accessed in June  - after his report had been published - for another purpose.Number  refused to explain why, citing security reasons. Where is the PMaposs old phone now  Number  wonapost say - again saying it was a security matter. Why did the Cabinet Office keep Lord Geidt in the dark  Lord Brownlow offered to share the texts with Lord Geidt at the same time as he gave them to the Electoral Commission. The Cabinet Office blocked this, Number  claims, because it might interfere with the watchdogaposs statutory investigation. But the PM admitted in his letter that it was unacceptable for them to not even tell Lord Geidtaposs team that they existed. Was Boris Johnsonaposs interest in a aposGreat Exhibitionapos linked to the refurbishment cash  And whataposs the dference between a aposGreat Exhibitionapos and aposFestival UKapos  In the same text message Boris Johnson used to ask Lord Brownlow to release more cash, he added: Ps am on the great exhibition plan Will revert.” In his reply, Lord Brownlow said: Thanks for thinking about GE. A few months later, in January , records show then-Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden met with representatives of the Royal Albert Hall and Lord Brownlow to discuss a aposGreat Exhibition .apos Number  denied any link between Lord Brownlow donating cash for Boris Johnsonaposs flat refurb, and securing both the PMaposs personal attention and a meeting with the Culture Secretary to discuss the project. The spokesman said: This isnapost something that weaposve taken forward. DCMS have taken forward Festival UK this year. He added: Lord Brownlow acted in a manner consistent with his experience in blind trusts. But he was unable to explain the dference between the Great Exhibition . project and the Festival UK project - now known as UNBOXED - set to take place later this year.

And rules on travelling into the UK have been relaxed, since the iant is now dominant in Britain anyway. On top of this, daily tests were announced for , critical workers in England in a bid to tackle crippling staff shortages.And changes have also been announced this week for school pupils, with masks ing in classrooms and heads being warned they could have to merge groups. As usual it can be quite dficult to wrap your head round so many changes at once. So we take you through them step by step.Follow-up PCR tests temporarily axed for millionsFollow-up PCR tests will be temporarily axed throughout the UK for people who get Covid with no symptoms. The UK Health Security Agency agreed a change in policy for millions of people who test positive for the virus by lateral flow. The change will take effect from January  in England, and from tomorrow in Wales and Scotland. It is only temporary, and will be reversed when the worst of the Omicron wave is over. Currently, anyone who tests positive using a lateral flow testmust get a follow-up PCR test to confirm their result. Following the rule change, people who test positive with no symptoms - said to account for around % of people with Covid - will no longer need this follow-up PCR test. They will still have toisolate for at least seven days,but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.People with Covid symptoms will still be told to get a PCR test, regardless of their lateral flow result.The change - last performed in January-March  - will effectively cut the isolation time because it takes a couple of days to get and await the result of a PCR test. This couldease crippling staff shortages including in the NHS. It will also ease the demand for PCR tests afterpeople struggled to get appointments in the Omicron wave.But it has raised fears about detection of Covid falling just as the virus is running rampant, because PCRs are what the government use to trace the spread of new iants. No admitted the PCR test changes are about “what is the best use of our testing system at a time of high prevalence”. People who want to claim the £ Test and Trace Support Payment will still need a follow-up PCR.Pre-departure travel tests scrapped for the jabbedPCR tests will be scrapped for double-jabbed people arriving in the UK from Friday.Boris Johnsonimposed tougher testing requirements on travellers when Omicron emerged in November as he battled to halt the spread of the iant, which was first detected in South Africa.But ministers are agreed to axe these curbs and bring travel testing rules back to how they were before Omicron surged. The Prime Minister told MPs the requirement for pre-departure tests for those arriving in the UK would be axed from am on Friday. And aposday twoapos PCR tests after arrival in the UK will be replaced with cheaper lateral flow test. The requirement to self isolate until a result has been received has also been scrapped. However, people who are not fully vaccinated must still take a pre departure test, self isolate for  days on arrival, and take post-arrival PCR tests on days  and . School pupils wear masks and classes could be mergedSchool pupils in England ed this week with a series of updated rules. Secondary school pupils are being asked to do a lateral flow test on site on their first day back to school. If they test positive, they are sent home to do a confirmatory PCR test. If it is negative then they can carry on with their school day. Secondary, college and university students and staff should then continue to test themselves at home twice a week. Meanwhile secondary school pupils are now being told to wear masks in the classroom, as well as in communal areas. The advice will be in place until January , when Plan B regulations are due to expire. And ministers have suggested sending groups of children home or merging classesnecessary to keep schools open. If your child tests positive, you are advised to do daily lateral flow tests for a week but you do not have to stay at home. , critical workers to get daily testsWorkers in critical industries will be told to take daily tests to prevent mass staffing shortages caused by the Omicron surge. From January , , critical workers in areas from food processing to transport and border force will be asked to do lateral flow tests every working day. There is no full list yet of the industries which would be included in the scheme, but businesses involved will be contacted directly. No appeared to suggest it would not include supermarkets.Plan B continues for three more weeksToday was the day for England’s Covid Plan B to be reviewed, and either extended, wound down or made stricter. Boris Johnson chose to extend the current rules, but without introducing any new ones, by three weeks.There will be a further review before the regulations expire on January . But Plan B could be extended beyond that date, with No not ruling it out. If so MPs will get a vote before the change happens. Plan B asks people to work from home where possible, and imposes mandatory masks in shops and public transport. It also puts a legal requirement on nightclubs and other crowded or large venues to demand ‘Covid passes’ from punters - either showing they’ve been vaccinated or had a recent negative test.No doesn’t rule out more measures - or extending Plan B beyond January The PM’s spokesman said: “As throughout the pandemic, we don’t rule out anything further given it’s impossible to predict the course of a global pandemic”. He confirmed MPs will get a vote before January the Plan B measures have to be extended beyond that date.Isolation is still at least seven days - including in ScotlandAs a default, people who test positive for Covid should isolate for  days. But in all four UK nations, they can now leave isolation after seven days -lateral flow tests on days  and  come back negative. England was the first to announce the change just before Christmas, followed by Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland finally announced a similar change today. But there’s little chance of isolation being cut to five daysNo suggested there was little chance of the UK cutting isolation from seven days to five. MPs had called for the move after it was applied to asymptomatic people in the US. But the PM’s spokesman said there is a “signicant chance” people are still infectiousisolation is less than seven days, and “leaving isolation would present a public health risk”.Other changes in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon announced the Covid self-isolation period will be cut from ten days to seven in Scotland. Close contacts who are under  or boosted will also no longer be forced to isolate, but must take regular LFTs. Both changes bring Scotland in line with changes that were introduced in England before Christmas. A further £m will also be made available to support businesses struggling to cope with restrictions in Scotland. The First Minister said: “This phase of the pandemic is possibly the most challenging so far. The most infectious iant so far is creating a volume of cases that, notwithstanding its possibly reduced severity, still has the potential to overwhelm us.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSPlan BBoris JohnsonEducationSchoolsPublic transportSecondary schoolPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A snap survey by the NAHT union found the majorityhad pupils absent due to Covid, while nearly a thirdreported over % of children were out of class because of the virus. The poll of nearly , school leaders in England revealed staff shortages amid mounting fears over fresh disruption to childrenaposs learning. More than a thirdof school leaders said over % of staff were absent on the first day of term for Covid-related reasons. Around a quartersaid more than % of teachers were off due to the virus, while nearly one in said they had more than % of their teaching staff absent.  Halfof heads said they were using supply teachers to cover classes - but over a thirdwere unable to source the supply staff they need. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has told schools to merge classesstaff shortages grow too high, in order to keep children in school. However only % said they had sent classes or year groups home and fewer than % of heads reported having to merge classes or year groups. NAHT General Secretary Paul Whiteman said: “Schools are doing everything they can to maintain education for pupils in the face of very challenging circumstances. Staff absence on the first day of term was considerable and school leaders have been doing what they can to redeploy teachers and other support staff to avoid being forced to combine classes or send groups home.  “Given that this is a snapshot of just the first day of term, this is a very worrying picture. Infection rates – and therefore absence due to illness – could very likely rise as the term progresses, and already half of schools are having to turn to supply staff, with many finding they cannot secure suitable cover. Many schools are teetering on the edge and the next few weeks at least will undoubtedly continue to be an incredibly challenging time. Meanwhile, a separate survey found Government plans to provide , air puriers for schools and colleges will fall thousands short. A poll by the NASUWT teachers union foundof the nearly , teachers who responded said they do not have access to a CO monitor in their classroom. Even for those that do have a classroom monitor, nearly one in tensaid it was not working properly. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: The government has no plan to prevent nor to manage thousands of staff being off school due to Covid. “Ventilation, vaccination and testing are key to keeping schools running but the government’s chaotic, mismanagement means tests aren’t available, only half of eligible pupils have been vaccinated, and children are being left to learn in coats next to open windows as temperatures plummet. “Again and again our children have been treated as an afterthought by Conservative Ministers, seemingly unable to act until it’s too late. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We’ve supported schools to continue classroom learning for pupils through encouraging former teachers to step in and extending the Covid workforce fund for schools that are facing the greatest staffing and funding pressures. “We’ve also asked schools to have contingency plans to maximise attendance and minimise disruption to learning, should they have high rates of staff absence, and are working with the sector to share case studies of flexible learning models to support the development of those plans.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanEducationSchoolsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

By am on January  - just seven days into  - the average FTSE  chief executivewill have been paid the average UK worker’s annual salary, the High Pay Centre said in its report. Most FTSE  firms have not yet announced CEO pay for their financial year ending in , but % of those that have recorded an increase on  levels, the think tank added. TUC General Secretary Frances OaposGrady said too much wealth is being hoarded at the top. The GMB Union - campaigning for care workers to get at least £ an hour - slammed the dference in wages as a disgrace.  GMB general secretary Gary Smith said: “Fat cat bosses trousering  times more than the carers who look after our loved ones is a disgrace. “It doesn’t look very levelled up and is everything that’s wrong with our economy. “All workers must be properly paid and valuedwe want to get our post-Covid economy on track.” It comes as a report reveals that community-led social care could hold the key to tackling the crisis gripping the sector. A study by the think tank Locality calls on leaders to focus more on smaller providers than big firms. The -page report says: “There is a growing body of evidence showing the value of community power in adult social care.  These services keep people independent and living in their communities for longer. They provide greater choice and control over the support local people can access.” The Government was blasted last month for unveiling an “incredibly thin” -year “vision” for social care which even it admitted “will not solve all of the problems”Some  months after Boris Johnson claimed he had “a clear plan prepared” which “will fix the crisis in social care once and for all”, Care Minister Gillian Keegan published a White Paper which she conceded was only “a first step”. Writing the foreword to the long-awaited document, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “The proposals outlined will not solve all of the problems.”The Locality report, seen by the Mirror, says social care “is an area where there is a pressing need to find innovative new solutions – driven both by a desire to raise the quality of service being provided, plus a need to drive down budget pressures”. It adds: “It is an area where it is recognised that community organisations can make a distinctive contribution. “Community organisations have a particular role to play in this, which has historically been underplayed, but whose transformative potential is being recognised more and more.” Locality chief executive Tony Armstrong said: “We’ve seen the social care crisis develop over a long time. “The current system is broken and we need a long term fix, and quickly.

The top Tory said the advice to wear face coverings in secondary schools was necessary during the bumpiest of the next few weeks with Omicron but he hoped to rip up the rules as soon as possible.It comes as Boris Johnson confirmed to MPs that Covid Plan B measures would remain in place for another three weeks in England, which include face masks in indoor settings and advice to work from home. The Prime Minister has resisted imposing further restrictions despite record case numbers, rising hospital admissions and intense pressure on the NHS.Schools are braced for rising infection rates and staff shortages as pupils begin ing to the classroom after the Christmas holidays. The Education Secretary tightened the rules ahead of the start of term, including masks in class and regular tests for secondary schools.  Speaking in the Commons, Mr Zahawi said face masks were the price worth paying to keep children in the classroom, adding: For the shortest possible time - and not a day more - that is what we will recommend. It is the sensible thing, the pragmatic thing and a proportionate thing to do. I will be reviewing this on January  when I hope that data will allow us to ditch masks in class.He said the Government would do everything in our power to keep all education and childcare settings open and teaching in-person.But Mr Zahawi admitted that schools were likely to face increased pressures on staffing as Covid infections soar.Schools will be suffering some degree of staff absences, he told MPs. At the end of last year the figure was about % of staff off, and that is probably likely to rise with increasing cases in school and of course young people as weto school. He vowed to reveal later this week how many retired teachers had answered the Governmentaposs call toto class to bolster the workforce. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said that for the Government children are never a priority as she criticised the slow rollout of ventilation devices. Labour said the promised , air puriers won’t start arriving in schools and colleges until next week -  days after SAGE first warned about the importance of ventilation for getting children back into school in May .Ms Phillipson said: Children are having to be wrapped up in their coats to learn.

Paul Scully was instantly able to recall the rise in the minimum wage for over-s, from £. an hour to £. in April. But quizzed by Sky News he replied: “I don’t buy my milk in pints these days, I tend to buy the four pint, erm, larger, larger, erm, cartons.” The ‘pint of milk’ test is often used on politicians and many have fallen foul of it before.Chancellor Rishi Sunak suggested a tin of beans cost p, only to be told it cost p, in an October interview. Tesco charge p for one pint of semi-skimmed milk.Critics say such questions are more about a pop quiz than proper policy - and Mr Scully insisted: “It’s not about what I buy as part of a larger shop.” But Sky News presenter Samantha Washington told him: “It’s about demonstrating you are a government that understands the cost of living and the pressures on people’s budgets.”  Mr Scully gave a long answer - but could not name the price of a pint of milk, or of his four-pint preferred carton. He said: “What it’s about is it’s about making sure we have a massive pandemic, as you unwind that pandemic you get into the global situations of supply chains, of energy costs affecting not just people in Britain but people around the world. “We’ve got to make sure we look after people in this country, what we’re doing is we’re targeting in particular the lowest paid.” The Prime Minister is set to hold meetings next week ahead of February , when Ofgem will announce an April rise in energy bills. Experts predict it could announce the current £,-a-year price cap on standard tarfs will soar by £ or £ in one burst, forcing many to choose between heating and eating.  A government spokesperson said: “Ministers are working with the regulator and suppliers to explore potential mitigations so we can protect consumers from high energy costs.” Energy firms are asking for help to spread April’s cost across multiple years with funding from banks, guarantees or taxpayers worth up to £billion.The £-a-year Warm Home Discount can be extended, but it would likely only kick in next winter, leaving no immediate help.Green levies could be removed from bills, but it’d leave the Treasury with a black hole and harm Net Zero ambitions.And while Labour and the Mirror are calling for VAT on bills to be axed, Boris Johnson claims it would be a “blunt instrument” not targeted at the poorest. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner warned an “iceberg” is heading for poor families, and most agree something must be done. A No spokesman said: “I’m not going to get into internal discussions. We’re listening to businesses and consumers for how we abate the costs of energy and that work is ongoing.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON OfgemThe TreasuryConservative PartyPMQsBoris JohnsonEnergy billsMinimum wagePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You can literally go in any direction.  aposWhen Iaposve spoken about that in the past I have been slammed a little bit, with people saying itaposs easy for you to say that because youaposve not grown up in poverty, so for you to sit there and say we all have the same  hours in a day is not correct. But, technically, what Iaposm saying is correct. We do. She went on: “I understand we all have dferent backgrounds and we’re all raised in dferent ways and we do have dferent financial situations, but I thinkyou want something enough you can achieve it. “It just depends on what s you want to go to get where you want to be in the future. And I’ll go to any .” She then added: “I’ve worked my absolute a*** off to get where I am now.” The comments were branded tone deaf on social media, with critics saying many hard-working Brits are struggling to make ends meet amid a cost of living crunch.  But Molly-Mae found an unlikely ally in Tory Minister Paul Scully. Askedher comments were fair, Mr Scully told LBC: I think it is, but I think youaposve got to define success, because some of the comments that I was hearing in the lead up to my piece on this was about money, but success doesnapost necessarily equal money. It can be, you know, furthering your job, whether itaposs in public service or whatever. And I think an aspirational approach to le is no bad thing. What weaposve got to make sure, though, is that opportunity is equally distributed around the country. And thataposs why the levelling up agenda that we often talk about in government is so, so important to make sure that those  hours can be matched by the opportunities by education and business across the country.

John Clark, , and Charlotte Deniz, , achieved their goals after following a structured meal prep plan on a budget, and some dishes cost p a serving. The fitness couple says they spend six hours every Sunday creating  meals for Monday to Friday. John said: Thereaposs a myth that eating healthy is expensive but itaposs about being resourceful with what youaposve got. The first thing to do is look through your fridge and make sure thereaposs nothing going to waste. Pick meals that include any food you may have left over for the week. Tins of chickpeas can be your best friend. A tin is around p and you can make four chickpea burgers with it. A pack of four burger buns is p so thataposs a burger for under p. We shop at the market, Home Bargains, Aldi and Tesco. Itaposs all about finding the lowest price.  Everything can be done cheap, you just have to look and shop around. John, who used to weigh -stone, is now -stone while Charlotte slimmed down from a size  to an eight. The couple has also taken pictures with their old trousers to show how much weight they have lost. The couple also shows others how they can prep their meals for the week through their book, The Meal Prep King Plan.  A weekly meal plan includes tuna, cheese and egg muffins for breakfast, roasted red pepper and tomato soup for lunch and cottage pie for dinner. Another day might include a raspberry pot for breakfast followed by chicken and vegetable traybake for lunch and lasagne for tea. Their recipes also include sweet treats such as sweet potato brownies and protein balls. He added: It saves time and money and it works for us. I call it a lestyle and not a diet because a diet suggests thereaposs an end and unless youaposre going to stop eating food, there is no end. To me, a diet means being restrictive and miserable. People are amazed Charlotte did it in ten months but thataposs only two pounds a week.  I started this because I was sick of companies praying on desperate people who want to lose weight around Christmas time with fads and quick fixes. I wanted to give people proper hope and sustainability. I used to be known as fat John before my journey. I went to the GP and asked for advice and I was disgusted in the lack of help.  I went to the library to research weight loss for myself and thataposs when I started meal prepping as Iaposve always loved to cook. I tried everything to lose weight, Keto, weight watchers, slimming world, but nothing worked until this.The Bolton-based man also documents his recipes and weight-loss tips on his Instagram, @themealprepking, to his K followers and is due to release his second cookbook in April this year.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FoodFitnessWeight loss success storiesDiet\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Researchers looked at four risk factors for dementia - smoking, obesity, high blood sugar, and low education - and the impact they will have on future trends along with population growth and ageing. In the UK, the number of dementia cases is projected to increase by %, from just over , in  to almost . million in . And worldwide cases are estimated to nearly triple from an estimated  million in  to  million in . Better education globally is projected to reduce global dementia prevalence by . million cases by  but at the same time obesity, high blood sugar, and smoking, are expected to result in an additional . million sufferers.  Dementia cases will rise in every country, with the smallest estimated increases in high-income Asia Pacicand western Europe , the study suggests. According to the estimates, the largest growth will be in north Africa and the Middle Eastand eastern sub-Saharan Africa . In western Europe, the number of dementia cases is expected to rise by %, from almost eight million in  to nearly  million in . Relatively small increases in cases are expected in Greece , Italy , Finland , Sweden , and Germany . The Global Burden of Disease study is the first to provide forecasting estimates for adults aged  and older across  countries worldwide, and is published in The Lancet Public Health. The scientists call for more aggressive prevention efforts to reduce dementia risk through lestyle factors, such as education, diet, and exercise.  Lead author Emma Nichols, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluationat the University of Washington, US, said: Our study offers improved forecasts for dementia on a global scale as well as the country level, giving policymakers and public health experts new insights to understand the drivers of these increases, based on the best available data. She added: At the same time, we need to focus more on prevention and control of risk factors before they result in dementia. Even modest advances in preventing dementia or delaying its progression would pay remarkable idends. To have the greatest impact, we need to reduce exposure to the leading risk factors in each country. For most, this means scaling up locally appropriate, low-cost programmes that support healthier diets, more exercise, quitting smoking, and better access to education. And it also means continuing to invest in research to identy effective treatments to stop, slow, or prevent dementia. Across the world, more women are affected by dementia than men. In , women with dementia outnumbered men with dementia  to , and this pattern is expected to remain in . Co-author Dr Jaimie Steinmetz, from the IHME, said: Itaposs not just because women tend to live longer. There is evidence of sex dferences in the biological mechanisms that underlie dementia. Itaposs been suggested that Alzheimeraposs disease may spread dferently in the brains of women than in men, and several genetic risk factors seem related to the disease risk by sex.

They are now appealing for someone to come forward and foster himGizmo needs a new home but carers will have to be patient with him Image: Friends of RescueByJilly BeattieSam Elliott-Gibbs:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments A dog found covered maggots who rescuers heartbreakingly say has never had anyone treat him nicely is now in need of a special new owner.A foster carer is desperately needed for neglected -year-old Gizmo, who was saved after being discovered with his eyes shut together with his own faeces.The dog was found in County Derry, northern Ireland, on Monday, according to Belfast Live and an appeal has been launched to find him a new home.He was filthy, in pain, suffering ious infections and was unable to see or move properly due to his infected skin. Now the charity who came to his aid hope someone can make his le a whole lot better. They believe Gizmo may had been dumped and after the horrying mistreatment they want to put him back on the right path. A spokesperson for Friends of Rescue said: “Once he was safe in the garden, he hid behind the shed. It’s hard to even make out what kind of dog he is, as he was just a lump of smelly infected dog hair. “Immediately the finder brought him in and shaved off some of that hair. His eyes were stuck together with poo and he had pus oozing from dferent parts of his body. “The poor wee pet had poo and sores on his back end and he was suffering from maggots... just horrendous. The finder took off what they could, but had to be careful as they didn’t know what they were shaving since he is covered in masses which could have been mistaken for matts.  “On Monday we took him to our vets for a check over but he is so sore and frightened that he didn’t like to be touched. His scrotum is swollen to three times the size it should be and it’s oozing pus. He also has four or five big lumps on his belly. “And his eyeballs are so scraped and damaged it’s unlikely that he can see. That’s all we could tell from the immediate check as it was too stressful and sore for him to be touched. “On Tuesday we had to sedate him to get a proper look at him and the plan was to neuter him while he was underall was OK. Unfortunately he is just so extremely infected, his testicles in particular, that it just couldn’t be done.  “So he got his bloods taken to ensure his organs are ing OK but the rest we will have to put on hold until we start clearing these infections with medication. “Our favourite vet nurse in the world Rosie gave him a bath and clipped him and although he was a little cross with her, he did well under the circumstances. Whoever steps forward to adopt the dog will need to be patient. They added: “As you can understand this wee man is extremely shut down. He doesn’t want anyone near him and who can blame him - as you can see from our pictures he just wants to be invisible.  “We don’t imagine anyone has ever been nice to him before but we think that he knows we mean well and we are trying. “We really need a foster for this boy to help him on his journey, and we are appealing for a foster family who will allow him to rest, recover and just live in their house until such times as he knows you mean him no harm. “We don’t know how he is with other dogs or cats. Any children in the home are very dog savvy and mature enough to understand he needs his space. “We really want to start his journey on the right foot with the right foster. He is chipped and the name on the chip is Gizmo and he is . We would ask for anyone to get in touch with usthey have any information. “For now, we have welcomed him to Friends of Rescue and we hope a new name and a new le awaits him.”If you feel you could help this little dog or support Friends of Rescue, please click here and send them a message.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AdoptionDogsTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In one video, the driver can be seen opening the back doors of his van and whipping out a mattress and leaving it next to a skip in a back alley behind Arnold Street. In another, he is seen unloading more rubbish behind a nearby St Augustine Street, just around the corner. The driver later ed and collected the items. Residents said he told them that he was going to take them to the tip but it was closed at the time. Courier firm DPD said it will be looking into the incident, which took place on January , and is aiming to identy the driver in the footage in order for it to take further action.  A local resident, who did not wish to be named, said: “Fly-tipping in the area is not good enough. It just shouldnapost happen. This time the person didnapost realise there was a camera and that people also saw them do it. We want to make an example out of them so that this doesnapost happen again. It costs the council a lot of money and they have to collect it, which they have been really good with. Local councillor Rabiya Jiva said fly-tipping has happened on numerous occasions in the area, but that no evidence had been discovered until the emergence of the footage. She said: Bolton Council has been notied by multiple residents surrounding this incident and fly-tipping in the area, and enforcement action will be taken.  We want the area to be a cleaner and brighter place for all residents and people who live close by. We also want people to use the tip services provided and report it when they see incidents like this and ring their local authorities.” In a DPD company statement, a spokesperson said: At DPD we take the conduct of our people very seriously indeed, including their interaction with other road users, our customers and their property. The behaviour of our driver here was unforgivable and completely unacceptable. The driver will be identied and appropriate action will be taken.

Ducks living inside Alanaposs home were also killed in the cull. Alan described the last two weeks as “a nightmare”, but said he was feeling fine but devastated by the loss of his beloved ducks.  Iaposm totally fine myself - I am just upset about what happened to the ducks. Iaposd been with them for more than  years so itaposs a huge loss. They were my family - they were my le. Apparently I have got the virus, as far as I can tell I have no ailments whatsoever. Alan said he believes the killing of the ducks was way over the top saying he is saddened at the fact they would have known what was happening to them. Looking back on fond memories with his ducks, Alan said the ducks would sit on his slippers to warm them and enjoyed sharing tea and biscuits with him. Ellesha, a mum-of-one, said the family are in shock at the news - and are finding it hard to process. She said: The past couple of weeks have been hell for this family. He saw all of his ducks killed, and they were like his closest friends.  He is often on the phone to us, asking what the doctors have said - but we canapost answer questions we donapost know the answers to. Ellesha said Alan first began to notice several ducks of his huge flock becoming sick a few days before Christmas. After DEFRA and APHA got wind, more than  ducks living outside of Alanaposs house on his property were culled in a bid to prevent the spread, shortly after Christmas. Despite pleading against it, the  ducks which lived inside his home with him were culled on New Years Day by a team in Hazmat suits. While the outside of the property has been partially cleaned, the family say the interior of the property remains contaminated until he is confirmed to be no longer infectious.

At one point he was on % oxygenAndrew Pugh spent three weeks in intensive care after testing positive for Covid Image: Andrew Pugh   SWNSByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Jan | comments Intensive care units are filled with people battling Covid - up to % without booster jabs, and % completely unvaccinated. They have put their own lives at risk and piled pressure on our creaking NHS.And with every passing day there seems to be another case of someone who had refused the vaccine falling seriously ill and talking publicly about their regrets.Today, Boris Johnson condemned conspiracy theorists for spreading “complete mumbo-jumbo”, online, saying: “It’s time that I, government, call them out on what they’re doing, it is absolutely wrong.”Here we get inside the mind of one man who refused the jab to discover what shaped his thinking - and how he feels believing the lies he read on social media took him close to death... The first days of the New Year have been long and frightening for Andrew Pugh, propped in his hospital bed, an oxygen mask on, no visitors for comfort. As we talk by phone his breath is laboured, but most disturbing is how broken he sounds. Often emotional during his frequent pauses, the once happy-go-lucky binman, a dad-of-three, hands-on grandfather to five, sounds simply forlorn. “I just feel so stupid,” he says. “It was me being pigheaded, thinking it won’t get me, I’m fit and healthy, I might get a mild cold. It’s not like that.” Andrew, only , is recovering from three weeks in intensive care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital with Covid- he caught in early December. At one point he was on % oxygen and his partner was told he had a - chance of survival.  As well as his breathlessness, the knowledge he will need months to recuperate, the terrying memories of the hallucinations he experienced in ICU, the screams of the other patients, what crushes him most is one simple fact. If he had been vaccinated, he would likely have avoided it all. Andrew, from Tunnel Hill, Worcester, chose to decline even his first jab, and now knows he could have died because of that decision. Today, he reads messages from his children feeling wretched. “They have been worried sick,” he says. “When I see all the comments, about how much they miss me, I know I should have had the vaccine. “Christmas Day was probably when it hit me the most. My partner could visit, for one hour. She cried, I was crying, I cry now on my own, because this isn’t even the start of it, I will have to do a lot to get where I used to be. “I know now I should have had it, it could have been too late, I could have left all my family heartbroken.”  Limply, he adds: “I just love my partner, and all my family, and I could have left every one of them.” It is easy to judge, but also hard to feel anything but sympathy for this devastated man, who admits the guilt the feels, not just towards his family, but staff here. He has watched them working frantically for weeks. He knows at least one young woman, a mum in her thirties, has died of Covid while he has been here. “One doctor asked me why I never had the jab, but they don’t judge,” he says. “I do feel guilty, a lot. This ward is absolutely rammed. The ICU is the worst. Some of them were screaming they couldn’t breathe. I feel sorry for the nurses.” So why didn’t Andrew have his vaccines  With as many as % of patients currently in intensive care with Covid without a booster, and over % without any vaccination at all, the need to truly listen to their reasons, and to persuade them otherwise, is crucial.  Andrew candidly wants to explain and tell others not to make the choice he did. “I thought the vaccine was just made too quick,” is the first thing he says. ”It’s all scared me from the beginning.” Although not a previous anti-vaxxer, he struggled to trust how this one could be safe, and was particularly disturbed by reports of blood clots connected extremely rarely to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. “I have really big icose veins in my legs, it really put me off,” he adds, admitting he did not seek reassurance from a doctor he would not be at particular risk. He acknowledges the irony during our conversation, when a medic interrupts us to take his blood to check for blood clots, because of pains in his legs.And then there was Facebook.England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said this week “the great majority” of those in intensive care, unjabbed, are “not anti-vaxxers in the ordinary sense with some really weird ideas”, but had been influenced by misinformation online. It was on social media Andrew sourced information about the vaccines. Or rather, found himself influenced by misinformation in posts from unknowns. “Every time I try to look at things on Facebook you get people pump into your head conspiracy theories of this, or that. I was being sucked in,” he admits.  “They say the ones having the jabs are dying, having heart attacks and blood clots. There was one about a footballer dying of a heart attack - but it was actually nothing to do with the Covid jab.” He’s still reading them on his phone in hospital - but now with anger. “There was one just half an hour ago about an -year-old girl dying. I think they call them trolls, they are trying to scare people.” He adds: “Facebook should do more to monitor what is put on there, police it, they know it’s going up. What people are saying on there almost cost my le.” But ultimately, he blames himself and concedes as time went on stubbornness set in. His partner Alison Williams, a carer, regularly begged him to get jabbed. He insisted he’d be fine. “I thought it was all out of proportion to start with. I didn’t know anyone in Worcester who had it really bad,” he says. “I thought I might get it, but never this bad.” On December  he felt shivery at work, came home and took a lateral flow test.  His quick-thinking sister brought around an oximeter and they were both surprised to see the percentage of oxygen in his blood at %. The normal blood oxygen saturation level is around –%. He came to hospital, was initially discharged, but was back a few days later. Then his memory goes for two days. Unbeknown to him, his partner was being told he had a - chance. Later, he recalls his fear as he struggled for breath in ICU, but thankfully did not need a ventilator. “I was hallucinating in there, I thought the doctors were trying to kill me, it was very frightening,” he admits. “There were a couple of days just lying there when I thought, why bother ” Now out of ICU, he has just come down from five litres of oxygen to one. He can walk unaided the ft round trip to the bathroom, but immediately needs his oxygen mask. He fears debilitation and indignity to come. “They say when you get home it will take months. I can’t run after the grandkids.They say the stairs will be hard, to sit and do them one at a time,” he says. But as soon as he is able, he will get his first vaccine. Other anti-vaxxers who changed their minds and got the jab Abderrahmane Fadil Last June the -year-old was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary struggling to breathe. The father-of-two said turning down his first jab was “the biggest mistake” of his le. “I never really believed I would get Covid or it would make me so ill,” he said.  Saja Ali The young mum was just  when she fell severely ill with Covid last February then her father was taken to hospital with it for  days. The anti-vaxxer from Didsbury, Manchester, said: “For me, it was all because it was new. It was a new vaccine and I was hearing a lot of conspiracy theories.”  Adam Sharp The -year-old, from Kirkcaldy, Fe, was put on a ventilator and his we was told he might not make it during nine days in ICU. He admitted: “I didn’t think I would need the vaccine because I kept so well.” Chelsie King The -year-old’s reason for refusing the jab was fear for her unborn child. She spent five weeks in a coma with Covid. Her son Raphael was delivered safely in that time. From Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, she said: “The truth is we could have both died.” Ffion Barnett Ffion had just turned  last summer when she was taken to Royal Glamorgan Hospital with breathing dficulties. In a coma for five days, she needed to relearn to relearn how to walk, talk, and eat. She said: “I thought, being young with no health conditions, I was safe. Obviously, I was wrong.” Gemma RobertsGemma reportedly ‘died eight times’ in Warrington Hospital after contracting Covid and sepsis last August.She said: “I was one of those people scared of having the jab. I heard it killed people.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonNHSChristmasNew YearHospitalsHeart attackHeart diseasePoliticsCoronavirus vaccineDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The giant mound of rubbish on Ford Street in the cityaposs historic Jewellery Quarter has grown into a stinking mountain of waste, with homeowners forced to put up with festering piles of trash on their doorsteps since . The rat-infested mounds have forced parents to ban their children from playing outdoors and residents too embarrassed to invite friends and family around.Shocking pictures show the disgusting heap made up of household rubbish, several sofas, mattresses, bin liners, chairs and piles of wooden pallets, BirminghamLive reports. Locals have said shameless fly-tippers have been making their lives a living hell by constantly adding to the huge pile – all while they said the council has done nothing to remove it.  The land in question has been privately owned since  and is therefore not the council’s responsibility. The council has served notice to the landowner. Dad-of-four Arjan Singh, , who lives on the road, said: People are going to be visiting our city this summer and are going to see eyesores like this. What opinion do you think visitors are going to be left with when they see things like this  It is embarrassing. It began four years ago and nothing was done to clear the streets and then during the pandemic it has just got worse and worse.  There are rats running about, its absolutely disgusting. Its like being in the Third World yet this is supposed to be a modern cosmopolitan city. It has made our area unsafe and unclean - something needs to be done as the problem is getting out of hand and causing everybody a lot of stress. Another homeowner, who did not want to be named, said: The mess is just horric and stinks. I wonapost let my children play outside anymore because Iaposve noticed rats running about and I think itaposs a terrible health hazard. Iaposm also too embarrassed to ask my friends around to visit because I donapost want them to see the conditions I am living next to.  But this has been going on for years now and still nothing has been done to clear it up. It makes me feel sick walking past it. The council needs to install CCTV as our own doorsteps have become a dumping ground for fly-tippers and nobody should be made to live like this. Anyone caught fly-tipping and illegally depositing waste could face a fine of up to £, or even prison. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: “Ultimately, the responsibility for this situation sits with the culprits. Those who dump waste are environmental criminals, who are expecting others in our city to foot the bill for the disposal of their rubbish and unwanted items. “There is no excuse for this anti-social behaviour, which shows no regard for the surroundings in which we all have to live and work - there are many legitimate ways to get rid of waste. “We investigate incidents and do not hesitate to prosecute offenders, as demonstrated in the past by many high-profile court cases.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Speaking to Nottinghamshire Live outside the court, she said: It feels like a never-ending tragedy that happened to me.I do not knowI will ever find the conclusive answer - I am just very angry, upset and let down.  During the second and final day of the inquest today, the court heard from witnesses involved in the youngsteraposs treatment in the weeks leading up to his death. Baby Emmett was taken to Nottingham University Hospitals Trustover concerns about his noisy breathing last April. The toddler attended two consultations to Queenaposs Medical Centre, where he saw Dr Andrew Preyell and Mr Mat Daniel, and underwent a pre-operation called adenoidectomy and also tonsil shaving. Prior to this, the baby had also undergone a sleep study at Kingaposs Mill Hospital, which determined Emmett was suffering from obstructive sleep apnea. The findings prompted specialists at NUH to schedule a provisional date for a surgery to investigate the cause of Emmettaposs obstructive breathing. This was due to take place on July  at the latest, Mr Mat Daniel told the court. However, this would have been months after Emmett was found dead in his cot at home in Alexandra Street, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, on May  last year. The earliest possible date for him to undergo the surgery would have been a week after the baby died, the inquest heard. Further investigations were due to take place at the Queenaposs Medical Centre in October this year, including potential discussions about Emmett needing a face mask or ventilation to help him breathe.  Dr Elizabeth Didcock, assistant coroner for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, said that while all the steps planned were correct - it might have been just too slow. I understand that work load might have affected this, she told the court. And I cannot say that this has caused Emmettaposs death - but we might have had a clearer picture now. A pathological examination found the cause of death was a combination of factors linked to his diagnosis of Downaposs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic viral tracheitis and an anomalous right subclavian artery. In response to the findings, Dr Preyell told the court: Every-time a child dies it is a great tragedy. But in this particular case it just feels uncomfortable that we do not know the specic cause of his death. In absence of another explanation, the inquest conclusion was that baby Emmett died of natural causes, in line with the pathological examination. A spokesperson for Sherwood Forest Hospitals said: “This is a very sad case and we would like to offer our condolences to Emmett’s family for their loss. There is always important learning to be taken from these tragic events and we will ensure that we further review our care, processes and procedures following the conclusion of the hearing.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsInquestsDowns syndrome\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dawn Paisley Mills, a mum-of-five from Toxteth, bought a bottle of Mionetto Prosecco on a Ryanair flight from Liverpool to Faro on July , , and was shocked when she read what she thought was the price.She said the bottle, a gt for her boyfriend, should have cost €, but when she ed from her flight she noticed a charge of £ from Ryanair on her bank statement, reported the Liverpool Echo.Dawn spent the next  months sending numerous complaints and requests for a refund to Ryanair - but it turned out the £ was the cost for herflight to Manchester six days later and not the bottle of prosecco. “I don’t usually buy anything on flights but a couple sitting next to me had bought the bottle and it was quite pretty and it was tiny, said Dawn.  “So I called them over so I could buy it as a present for my boyfriend. I didn’t think anything of it. I wanted to pay with cash but they said they were only taking cards, so I put my card in and paid.“I filmed myself with the bottle of wine to put on Facebook to let my friends know that I was on the flight. I was saying ‘look, I’ve bought this wine as a gt’.“I got home five days later and went into my bank account and saw I had been charged £. I was asking my bank to get the money back and they were telling me to give them all the evidence, so I sent them all the paperwork, the pictures of me. My bank askedI had a receipt, but at some point I cleared my bag out - you’re not going to keep a receipt you think is for €.”  Dawn said she made many attempts to get a refund, but struggled to get any response from Ryanairaposs automated customer service system. She said: “When you phone them, you don’t speak to people. They’re all automated calls and every time you ring through, this call puts you onto another automated voice which brings you back to the beginning, so you don’t get to speak to anybody. “Then they tell you to go online and when you go online, they’ve got these ‘chatbots’. You’re talking to these chatbots, trying to tell them what’s happened and then the chatbot says ‘we’ve not got enough information’ and then it cuts you off.” It wasnapost until last Wednesday, January , that she actually found the truth about what had happened. Dawn explained the payment for the bottle of wine had not shown up on her bank statement, which led to her confusion - and it likely means she got the bottle for free, as the card machines on the flight had been faulty.

A strange new symptom labelled an emergency warning sign has been found by an American health bodyThis strange symptom can be hard to spot but has been flagged by the Center For Disease Control Image: Getty Images Johner RFByHarry Thompson:,  Jan | comments The Omicron wave has introduced the world to a new set of symptoms to watch out for, and some of them require urgent medical attention. In the past, the three main Covid symptoms to look out for included a new and persistent cough, a fever and a shortness of breath., new Covid cases were reported in the UK by Public Heath on January  - a very real reminder that everyone needs to be on the lookout for warning signs and symptoms of Covid. Now a leading health agency has identied a new symptom that is being described as an emergency warning sign. What new Omicron symptom do you need to look out for   The American Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsays that people should be on the lookout for a new sense of confusion. The CDC say that people feeling this new found sense of confusion should “seek medical care immediately”. The ZOE COVID Symptom Study app, which was launched by health science company ZOE and Kingaposs College London, has also reported new confusion as a possible symptom.The app comprises over  million users data, making it “the world’s largest ongoing study. Millions have now experienced mental disruption as a symptom of Covid, the Express reports.The confusion is often called delirium and can cause a change in your normal behaviour and can come in two types: hyperactive or hypoactive delirium. How do you spot new confusion   Abrupt changes to the way people act, where they may begin to act strangely, is described as hyperactive delirium. This can involve distress, aggression and agitation. Meanwhile, hypoactive delirium is harder to spot and can make people less reactive than usual — and even drowsy. The symptom has been found more commonly in older people suffering with the virus, according to ZOE. The Express reports that of people aged  to  who have tested positive recently, % have reported delirium, while of those aged  or over — around % people have experienced it. This is of course not the only symptom people need to be aware of, however, it is important that people know what this newly found sign could mean. The process of understanding Omicron is still ongoing. Also, the public should be aware that delirium could also be a sign of a number of other medical conditions.As such it is advised you take a Covid test as quickly as possible and head to NHS website for more information on the symptom.The widely found symptoms of Omicron, according to research from South Africa are:Scratchy throat Mild muscle aches Extreme tiredness Dry cough Night sweatsRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Omicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Covid cases have been growing exponentially for the past two weeks, with , cases being confirmed on a single day on Tuesday. In the last seven days ,, people have been confirmed to have the virus, and concerns are growing about how the workforce canwith so many people needing to isolate. For almost two years the most common signs of Covid have been a high temperature and a cough, but now it appears a dferent set of symptoms are reigning supreme with the outbreak of the Omicron iant.  According to the ZOE Covid study, .% of people experiencing new cold-like symptoms are likely to have symptomatic Covid.A snotty nose, sore throat and headache are among those symptoms.Despite the huge numbers of cases, the Prime Minister has so far refused to bring in any further restrictions to combat the spread.It also comes amid news that around . million people in the UK - one in  - are likely to be suffering from long Covid, the highest number since estimates began.This includes more than half a million people who first had Covid-, or suspected they had the virus, at least one year ago. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics , are based on self-reported long Covid from a representative sample of people in private households. Responses were collected in the four weeks to December  last year - before the recent surge in coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron iant.The estimate of . million people with long Covid is up from . million at the end of October and , at the start of July. Of the . million, , peoplefirst had - or suspected they had - Covid- at least  weeks previously, while ,first had the virus at least a year earlier. Dr Claire Steves, scientist on the ZOE COVID Study app and Reader at King’s College London said:“It’s good news that the number of daily new cases has slowed for now. ZOE COVID Study data shows that this slow down is being driven by cases falling in London and in younger age groups. However, it’s worrying to see cases increasing in the over  age group.  This is the group we need to protect as they are the most likely to be hospitalised as a result of a COVID infection. It’s too early to knowcases have truly peaked in London, as schools are yet to reopen after the holidays. Weaposve seen school terms driving infection waves throughout the pandemic. The health and care systems are already under huge pressure, so we all need to take personal responsibility for limiting the spread of COVID. This could be in the form of regular testing, wearing masks, staying away from busy crowded places, meeting up outside and getting booster vaccines.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Andrew could find out on Friday whether he will face a full civil trial in New York over allegations he sexually abused Ms Giuffre in  on three occasions when she was just , claims he denies. If it gets the go-ahead and he loses, his accuser could also be awarded a settlement which legal experts predict could be as much as £million. There is a possibility Andrew could make an th hour offer of a ­signicant out of court settlement, but those with knowledge of the case have confirmed no ­discussions have taken place yet. A source said: “It is crunch time for Andrew on several fronts. “He is meeting all the costs himself so he needs to raise cash fast to pay bills which are increasing by the day. “If there was the potential to settle, well, that is an option, but it is in no doubt that the Queen would not assist him in doing so.” Senior royals including Prince Charles and Prince William were ­understood to be ­“absolutely furious” when they learned of suggestions that the monarch could be asked to settle Andrew’s bills.  A source said: “They are both of the opinion that Andrew can sort out his own mess.” The Mirror can reveal the Queen “would not assist” in any further financial settlement to Ms Giuffre over the sex allegations. Sources have revealed the Duke, who vehemently denies the claims, “wants to clear his name”, but realises a civil trial could cause catastrophic reputational damage to the monarchy. A source with knowledge of the proceedings said: ”No discussions have been had regarding a financial settlement. This is a US civil ­litigation, and given that the vast majority of US civil litigation is settled out of court, it would always remain an option on the table.”  Ms Giuffre has consistently said she wants to face the Duke in court. Andrew, , owns Chalet Helora in the ski resort of Verbier with ex-we Sarah Ferguson. It is ­understood to be his only method of raising substantial amounts of cash. The pair agreed last September to sell the seven-bedroom property to a wealthy European investor. They bought it from millionaire French socialite Isabelle de Rouvre in  for £.m. But the deal has not been completed. Sources close to the Duke suggest he wants to push the sale through “urgently”. Andrew and Fergie still owe £.million from the original purchase. Ms de Rouvre last year threatened to take them to court in Switzerland after they missed a payment date in December . The Yorks later agreed to pay the cash once they complete the sale of the property. As Andrew prepares to hear his fate Fergie, , and their ­children are this week enjoying “a final family holiday” at the chalet.  She was joined by daughters Beatrice, , and Eugenie, , and their families. One royal insider said: “It’s a stressful time for Andrew, so Sarah and the girls thought it would be best to be out of the way. They also know this will be the last time they get to enjoy the chalet so are making the most of it.” New York district judge Lewis Kaplan on Monday unsealed a  deal  between Ms Giuffre and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who ­trafficked her to pals for sex. It revealed the late financier had given her £, to stop her suing any future “potential defendants” linked to Epstein. Andrew’s lawyers claims he falls into that category and the case should be thrown out.

Sherrilyn Speid appeared before magistrates in Basildon, Essex, this afternoon after the alleged incident was captured on camera near to the M in October. The -year-old was filmed as she allegedly drove her £, Range Rover into an Insulate Britain activist near to junction  of the motorway near Thurrock. A video - filmed by another person at the protest - allegedly shows Speid driving her vehicle into the back of two protesters - described previously as a aposnudgeapos. The mum-of-one appeared in court room for a short hearing this afternoon. She faces a charge of dangerous driving and a second count of assault on activist Bethany Mogie , who was named in court today as the alleged victim. Speid, dressed all in black for her appearance, stood in the dock and spoke just to confirm her name, address and date of birth. She then said not guilty as each of the two charges was put to her during a -minute hearing. Rima Begum , prosecuting, told the court the alleged incident was captured in two minutes of video footage.  The Crownaposs case is that she drove her vehicle into protestors during an incident on October . It was captured on camera. The defendant is someone who is previously of good character. Speid, of Grays, Essex, was told her trial will be held at the same court. She was granted unconditional bail ahead of the next hearing in March. Speid, who was accompanied to court today by a friend, posed for waiting photographers as she left the building.  She previously said: I think itaposs disgusting that they were stopping working class people from getting to work and their kids to school and now theyaposre trying to prosecute a single mum. I could lose my whole livelihood. If I have a criminal record I wonapost be able to work with children anymore. Itaposs really not fair. All I was trying to do was take my son to school and go to work. These Insulate Britain protesters are middle class. They say they care about people and the country - so why would they want a single mum to lose her licence and her job  There is no one supporting the working class people who are trying to make an honest living and are working hard.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON School runCrimeDangerous drivingCourts\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

NCA Branch Commander Mark Howes said: “This was an extremely large amount of Class A drugs, with an estimated street value of £. million. The seizure would have been a major blow to the criminal network likely to be behind the attempted importation. “Organised crime groups involved in drug trafficking are often responsible for violence and exploitation in our communities, so cutting off their international supply lines protects the public from the harm these dangerous drugs can cause. “Working alongside our partners in Border Force, we continue to work on the frontline against drug smuggling.” The packages contained  kilos of heroin and  kilos of cocaine, investigators confirmed. Deffley will now be subject to a confiscation investigation under the Proceeds of Crime act to identy and seize the cash and goods obtained from his drug smuggling. Dave Smith, Regional Director Border Force South East  Europe, added: “Drug supply chains are violent and exploitative, degrading neighbourhoods across our country.  “The sentencing of Ross Deffley this week sends a clear message to anyone considering attempting to smuggle illegal drugs into the country that we remain committed and prepared in tackling drug supply chains. “Those officers involved in this seizure can be proud of their work in stopping these dangerous drugs from entering our communities.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Dover CorporationBorder ForceDave SmithDrugsCrimeCocaine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The final outcome of his case is not yet known, but what fascinates me is sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell ’s little black book.As our brilliant US Editor Christopher Bucktin disclosed,  Brits appear in this secret contact directory. US law officials are reviewing more than , phone numbers and dozens of email addresses in search of further evidence. There are no allegations of wrongdoing against any of those named. There’s nothing criminal about appearing in somebody’s contacts book. When I was a political correspondent, mine contained the private details of Tory MPs and ministers. That didn’t make me one of them.But there was traffic. I would call them for a story, a quote or some background information. They were in there for a reason. The FBI sees these named Brits, including some lords and ladies, merely as “potential witnesses, unless the evidence leads them ­where”.Fair enough. But what are Tony Blair, mentioned once, and  of his former Cabinet members, doing in the little black book  Why is Lord Peter Mandelson in there with “home” and “country home” phone numbers This list tells me rich, powerful and influential people, from pop stars to presidents and politicians to princes, rubbed shoulders in an international Establishment of “the beautul people”. Lawyers at Maxwell’s sex trafficking trial agreed the little black book should not be made public. Nonsense. It already has been, at a case involving Prince Andrew’s rape accuser Virginia Giuffre. Let’s open this Who’s Who of the jet set, and ask them why they were persons of interest to Maxwell and her dead lover, paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Plan B doomed to fail The reality of the Government’s Plan B to combat surging Omicron transmission is now clear. It is an abdication of ministerial responsibility, a Do-It-Yourself strategy for the population, with these rules: Buy more masks, and wear them at all times, unless appearing on TV to save the Prime Minister’s face. Don’t go to the office, work from home, whether you get paid or not. Do get yourself vaccinated to boost the Tories’ flagging political fortunes. Don’t party with pals, except in work-related gatherings exempt from the rules, with permission from Downing Street. Travel abroad irresponsibly to facilitate the import of new virus iants. On demand, show your Covid pass to anyone in authority. These rules will be reviewed regularly to avoid a lockdown that would save lives, but upset the Covidiot wing of the Conservative Party. Any inquiries should be made to the Department of Lateral Flow Testing, Notmeguv House, Whitehall.  aposLevelling upapos So that’s what the Government means by “levelling up”. It’s about filling in potholes for former Tory peers. Viscount Pothole – I’m sorry, Gage – , got a £, grant from the Getting Building Fund to do up the driveway to his Firle Estate in East Sussex. Building back better! I hope his stately home doesn’t need redecorating because the Boris Wallpaper Finance Fund is running low.

She said the pair then stopped her from driving away from a set of traffic lights as they shouted and screamed at her.

She said: These two people made it up.They may have got splashed a tiny bit because the surface of the road was wet, but certainly Iaposve not splashed anyone.

Now five years on she is still recoveringBridget Chioi, , from Arizona, said she felt a pop when bending down Image: Jam PressByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Jan | commentsA pregnant mum has told how she was out hiking and felt a pop in her head as she bent down to pick up her child but had no idea how serious it was. Bridget Chioi, , from Arizona, was carrying her -month-old daughter Liliana and felt the pop when she put her down for a break during the walk with friends. But being  weeks pregnant she didn’t think anything extra of the headache and dizziness that followed, and hiked home. Then her headache got worse and she was taken to hospital by her husband Chris where initially it was put down to dehydration. Now five years on, looking back, she said that she was sent home but “within  minutes of leaving the hospital” she lost her ability to speak.  Heading back to the hospital it was discovered that she had suffered a stroke. She told a TikTok video: I had an intraventricular drain placed into my skull. This allows that excess blood and fluids to leave your body while they wait for the swelling of the brain to go down. This is the part that saved my le. Bridget spent three weeks in hospital and later had her baby Roman, who was born healthy. But five years on and Bridget said she still is recovering from the stroke and only finished treatment to remove the rest of the AVM last November.  She said: It affects me every day, in all sorts of ways. I still suffer with the side effects of having a brain injury, and depression and PTSD doesnapost make it any easier. The rupture happened in my cerebellum, so my balance is affected. I get dizzy incredibly easily and walking in a straight line isnapost always doable. Tasks take a lot more energy than they used to, and keeping up with my two kids is a constant battle. I really try not to focus on my deficits... because at this point..

Willie Stokes, , was jailed in  when key witness Franklin Lee lied in court, convincing a jury the suspect was guilty of murder.It emerged last month Lee allegedly received a conjugal visit from his girlfriend and drugs, in a deal known as Sex for Lies, at a police station infor  testimony used to lock up Stokes, reports the Daily Star. He finally left prison this week and said he was most looking forward to a hug from his mum - as well as a corned beef sandwich. Stokesapos lawyer Michael Diamondstein said: “Today is a tremendous day. We’re all very thankful. “However, it’s also a sad day, because it reminds us of how lawless, unfair and unjust Philadelphia law enforcement was for so long.”  Shortly after Stokes was sent down, Lee was found guilty of perjury - lying in court- but, as no one informed him, Stokes was left to rot in jail. A charging document read: “Defendant said Willie Stokes told him he killed Leslie Campbell [in ]. “Defendant knew Willie Stokes had not made such a statement.” Stokes was jailed for le in  for the murder in north Philidelphia.  His mother, Gloria Williams, missed her son’s release as she was so nervous it would not happen after several setbacks over the years. Sister Renee said: “We just want him home. It’s been a long fight.” Lee has himself completed his own sentence for rape, murder and perjury and now works on an assembly line. He admitted he was ‘weak’ in accepting the bribes from the two detectives in the s, who have both since died.  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner will make a decision on whether to retry Stokes later this month. He said: “This remarkable case is marked by prosecutorial and policing practices that were too pervasive during the so-called tough-on-crime s and s, and unfortunately persist in far too many jurisdictions today. “Prosecutors have an obligation to seek justice, and to redefine prosecutorial success — not by ‘wins’ in the form of convictions, but by accuracy and fairness in resolving criminal investigations and prosecutions.” Five other men are said to be in jail in similar circumstances to Stokes.

I did a double-take and thought, aposI hope Iaposve bought the right kind of sausageapos. It was very odd, and the shop assistant had to call the manager over - he thought it was a joke and I thought it was a prank.

The images of flowing summer meadows seems to make the cows happier as they chomp on hay in confined spaces - and as a result are making more milk for farmers. The virtual reality goggles were developed under consultation with vets and have been tried out on a farm in Moscow where they were found to reduce anxiety. Now a farmer in Aksaray, Turkey, Izzet Kocak, has reportedly tried them on two cows to good effect. He told The Sun that their milk production has gone up from  to  litres a day.It is not the first time the farmer has used alternative ideas and in the past he has also tried playing classical music to cheer up his cows. He said: “They are watching a green pasture and it gives them an emotional boost. They are less stressed.”The hardware was developed by taking a human virtual reality headset and then fitting it to the exact specications of a cowaposs head. The software is also altered so that the colour scheme is in line with what scientists believe that the animals are able to see.They are able to see some colours but it is thought that they canapost see red or green and just shades of yellow and blue.  The Russian ministry of agriculture and food has said that studies show that environmental conditions can play a big part in the overall health of the cow and the quality and quantity of the milk produced. The images of the cows have gone viral on social media where people have compared the headsets to scenes from the film The Matrix. The farmers say theyaposve done this to improve their conditions, enabling them to relax into producing more milk. Itaposs pretty much like the Cow Matrix, read one tweet.

In the main city, Almaty, morgues are filling up, buildings have been torched and Russian sources say  police have been killed, three of them beheaded. Kazak officials blame “foreign terrorists” for the worst violence seen there since the end of the USSR in . But opposition to the hard-line government appears to be from local sources.

There are huge petrol queues, residents are struggling to buy food and the internet is down so people cannot access cash. Tonight, amid violence throughout the Central Asian republic, there were claims foreigners were being denied entry. The Russians went in at the invitation of Kazak president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev under a “peace-keeping” mission from neighbouring countries.  Moscow fears a knock-on effect that could trigger violence in Russia. Violence began on New Year’s Day after the government raised fuel prices. On Wed­­nesday protesters torched public buildings, chanting slogans against ex-President Nazarbayev.

Firefighters were called to the location in in Mallow, North Cork, at lunchtime on Monday. She is believed to have attempted the shortcut after fencing was blown down by strong winds over the weekend. The wide stretch of mud is on the site of a new main sewer being installed as part of works in the area. Two units of Mallow Fire Service responded quickly after Gardai who had been called to the scene asked them for help in safely extracting the woman from the quicksand-like conditions. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  Johnathan Madden, station manager at Mallow, said they arrived and rapidly assessed the situation. He told CorkBe: We were asked to give assistance, the woman was up to her waist, itaposs likely she was looking for a short-cut and parts of the site are firm enough, itaposs just that she was in a spot where mud had been backfilled and it was very loose.We have a walkway we can use for rescue from water, mud and snow, we inflated it and two firefighters were able to get out to her and dig her out by hand with shovels. The fire station manager said the woman was pretty shook up by her ordeal, but was checked by paramedics at the scene and was largely none the worse for her chilly, muddy ordeal. The site was secured and the works are continuing. Cork County Fire Service has reminded the public not to attempt to access sites such as these as they can pose dangers. The news comes after a dog saved his elderly owners after assisting firefighters in opening a door during a house fire. Pooch Chi Chi has been hailed after saving her ownersapos le by opening a LOCKED door for fire crews during a kitchen blaze. The dog managed to unlock the entrance and let a fire crew in after his owner collapsed on the kitchen floor. Now the fire crew have praised the clever mutt for coming to their aid while they struggled to gain access to the home in Yeovil, Somerset. Responders were searching for another entrance when they heard a click as the dog managed to unlock the door to let them in. They found the man, named only as Mr Green, collapsed on the floor in the kitchen as the fire took hold on the hob.

Keep warm and decide whether youll be able to turn back, find shelter or stay where you are and call for help.It is a good idea to let a responsible person know the details of where you are going and what you are doing.Having the right kit is essential not only to keep you warm and dry but to keep you safe. The kit you buy, and use should reflect the type of activity that you intend to do and the conditions you may face.Outdoor shops will be able to provide you with advice on what you may need. The following list details the essentials for general hillwalking:Wear well-fitting boots suitable for the terrain you will walk on and the activity you plan to do. Gaiters may be beneficial for areas that are particularly boggy or where ticks may be present.A layered system of clothing is always best as you can adjust for the temperature better. The base layer should wick away the moisture with an insulating mid-layer and a breathable waterproof jacketand trousers.A hat and gloves should be packed also. Avoid any materials that may absorb water e.g. cotton T-shirt or jeans. If possible, wear clothing, especially a waterproof jacket that is a bright colour, so that you can easily be found in the event of an emergency.Always, always have a map and compass and know how to use it. Smartphones or GPS are excellent navigation aids but should not be relied on solely. Make sure you have the right map for the area you are walking in and check that your compass is working each time before you set off.Only use a rucksack big enough for the items that you will need. You may have to keep the contents in a waterproof bagthe rucksack is not waterproof..removeA whistle, head torch , survival bag, group shelter, first aid kit and mobile phone are essential. If you walk on your own, consider using a Personal Locator Beacon.Walking poles are very useful as they save energy and limit damage to the knees. Don’t forget to pack according to the weather so a sun hat, sun glasses and sun screen along with midge repellent net should be packedappropriate. Take enough food for the whole of your journey and have some packed as emergency rations. Carry a water bottle. You will usually be able to top this up from mountain streams, but it’s best to check availability in advance so you don’t run short.Winter conditions in Scotland are prevalent for many months of the year.

will be the need for greater autonomy for the region.Mr Macron has been championing the idea since he took power five years ago and will use the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, which sets the political agenda of the region, to try to put it into practice.vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron, right, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference after a meeting at the Elysee Palace Speaking during a joint press conference with the head of the EU’s executive arm, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Macron said the

and to act together in a more co-ordinated way,” Mr Macron said, adding that he wants to develop Europe’s defence industry and increase the bloc’s technological autonomy.Amid lingering tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Mr Macron added that the EU will also build proposals for “an architecture of European security”, which is still largely dependent on the US and Nato.Mr Macron and Ms von

unvaccinated people.In an interview with a newspaper, Mr Macron described his strategy for pressuring vaccine refusers to get coronavirus jabs by using the word “emmerder” – rooted in the French word for “crap” and meaning to rile.His vulgar language dominated news broadcasts and provoked angry reactions from his political rivals.To move things forward on the continental stage on the vast array of

France speaks loud and clear, and France has Europe at heart,” she said.Among other main themes France wants to promote are the introduction of an EU minimum wage, a carbon tax on imported products

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls own natural winter wonder","story":"Hair ice is a type of ice that forms on dead wood and takes the shape of fine, silky hair.It is believed to be caused by a fungus and occurs in hard and dead wood, although the reason behind its formation remains unclear.The conditions for hair ice to occur are fairly specic, requiring just the right temperature, moisture and wood type – and it seems that the #temperate rainforest# of Argyll provides just that.Dr Phil Anderson from the Scottish Association for Marine Sciencefirst noticed hair ice when he moved to Taynuilt from Cambridge  years ago and has begun looking into the phenomenon.He said: #Hair ice is not that common butyou want to find it, Argyll is about as good a place as anywhere in the world.#I first noticed it in my garden there was this fragile bit of ice sitting in the sunshine where it shouldn#t have been. I#ve since seen it up Glen Lonan and other places locally.#I#ve worked in Antarctica and studied how snow hardens but I found hair ice formation absolutely fascinating. It#s just weird!#Dr Dorothee Gotz works at Lallemand Aquapharm, which has a lab at SAMS, and shares an interest in hair ice formation.Lallemand Aquapharm holds a culture collection that includes fungus and, as a microbiologist, Dr Gotz recognised that the fungus responsible for hair ice formation would be worth including in the collection.She said: #I saw hair ice for the first time three years ago in Sutherland#s Grove, so I took a sample to add to our collection.#It#s a fascinating bit of microbiology. A fungus that forms ice and degrades wood is certainly of interest and could potentially have industrial applications.#Both scientists are keen to find out why this phenomenon occurs but say there is very little published literature on it, perhaps because it is so rare.#We don#t know what#s in it for the fungus,# explains Dr Gotz. #It needs to expend a lot of energy to create the hair ice and there is no apparent benefit to doing this.#Water is a problem for micro-organisms when it freezes, as ice can puncture the membrane. Perhaps the fungus is trying to expel the water before it becomes a problem.#Hair ice is most likely to form on dead wood with no bark. It also forms on certain trees more than others and prefers hard woods such as birch.#As a rough guide,the gritters are out, then hair ice might be out too,# said Dr Anderson. #You’re most likely to find it on a crisp, sunny morning after a clear night.

The phases were well preserved and the deep ash pits and remnants of the iron grate, upon which coal burned in the furnaces, survived in “amazing” condition.The Waggonway features in episode three, shown on January  on BBC it can be watched online at bbc programmes ms"},{"url":null,"title":"letter-week-selfless-not-selfish","story":"And that other colleagues of yours were also shopping in Haddington High Street and at the farmers’ market.You witnessed the busiest market in  months, ably stewarded by Rotary Club volunteers, with local small businesses doing a good trade.St Mary’s Kirk and Haddington Pipe Band also benefitted from the kindness of the market by being allowed to raise funds. Haddington Pipe Band played for a crowd that really appreciated their annual attempt at dressing up as Santa, shepherds and wisemen.Similarly, in the previous days, both those groups had benefitted from having a cabin to raise funds through the kindness of the Business and Community Partnership volunteers, in the area in front of the Corn Exchange.Inside, many professional staff supported by more volunteers were administering vaccinations.Visitors from Edinburgh and Dunbar and Inverness and Dublin talked to me about how much they were enjoying the town.

with a shower and toilet block for drivers’ use.This facilities block would be formed from a former tourist information block on the site.This parking area would have space for up to  large vehicles.A new petrol filling station – including a retail kiosk and forecourt including six pumps, three jetwash bays and two air vac water bays – is a key part of the plans.Eight charging points for electric

It is opposed also by many who see what is happening in other countries that have previously brought in euthanasia laws, with all their supposed safeguards, who are now widening out proposals for those who might be included in categories able to access euthanasia services.The fact that some people want this service doesn’t mean we should legislate for it.My own view is that we should never legislate to say that a member of the medical profession must kill another human being, eventhat person wants it.There are those who say that many safeguards will be put in place, both for the medical profession and to protect those who may, in time, be vulnerable either to persuasion by others, directly or indirectly, to end their lives.Reading Iain Macwhirter’s article, while heis suggesting we might want to go down this road, is as good an argument as any for reasons why we absolutely should not agree to this legislation.Actions in The Netherlands, Belgium and where show that, once started, this opens the way to the “slippery slope”, as some people call it. It’s worth reading.If you want to commit suicide, so be it. If you want to use the services of Dignitas, so be it. Sad, but that is your choice.But don’t ask anyone  to do it for you, and wrap up the actions in words which pretend it is something . And don’t legislate to allow this action to be taken by the population at large.This is about killing another human being, and is not an action which you should ask anyone  to do for you, particularly in our medical profession.Councillor Eileen McCartin MBE, Scottish Liberal Democrats, Paisley.  SUFFERING IS IMMEDIATEYOUR recent coverage of the sensitive issue of assisted dying has highlighted the deeply-held views of parties on both sides of the argument. Of course there must be debate, much of which will be theoretical and none the worse for that.I write, however, with a plea that the suffering of those who genuinely wish for an end to their lives, and for whom there is no hope of recovery or effective palliative care, should be remembered at every stage of this debate.The pain, discomfort and constant nausea suffered by my mother as she died of lung cancer could not be eradicated by even the strongest medication, and even the kindest, best-informed care of the professional staff around her could not make her comfortable.The suffering of those whose illnesses are incurable is immediate, not something that can be put off until such time as a decision about assisted dying has been taken.We must of course have full and open debate on such a dficult matter, but I look forward to a decision sooner rather than later, given the extensive coverage of it as Liam McArthur’s Bill progresses through the Scottish parliament.Wendy Bellars, Pittenweem.  PROTECTION OF LOVED ONESI AM disappointed to find three articles in the Herald over the past two days, all in opposition to the provisions in MSP Liam McArthur’s Bill on Assisted Dying.I am writing for the opposite perspective, as a supporter of the Bill to give those with a terminal illness with no hope of a cure, but who are still mentally competent, a choice about the time and manner of their death.There is no evidence that the current blanket ban on assisted dying protects the vulnerable people who are the concern of some opposed to the Bill.There is, however, evidence that many people with terminal illness, like my mother with motor neurone disease, for which there is no cure, would have liked to choose the time and manner of her death without involving any of her family in an illegal act.We also know that some terminally ill Scots are being forced to travel abroad to access assisted dying. Some are suffering as they die at home, and some even feel forced to end their own lives due to a lack of choice in Scotland.Dying people do not just want this choice for themselves, but want to protect their loved ones from witnessing them suffer a bad death, the effects of which can be traumatising and long-lasting.Fiona McOwan, Limekilns, Fe.  MY CHOICES SHOULD BE RECOGNISEDGREAT strides have been made to protect the rights of the living, but those of the dying have been left behind with current laws that are inhumane and undemocratic, and abuse every citizen’s rights.I have traumatically witnessed “bad deaths” of loved ones against their confirmed wishes and as someone who lives with disabilities , my choices when dying should be recognised.It is time for Scotland to join with compassionate democracies such as New Zealand and Oregon in reforming the law to allow choice of safeguarded medical assistance in dying, for mentally competent, terminally ill adults.Liam McArthur’s proposals are about protecting and safeguarding inidual choice when nearing death, in addition to investment in excellent palliative care, not instead of it. Those opposedshould have their inidual choices safeguarded also, but should not be allowed to dictate mine or anyone ’s.Of course, safeguards are necessary – and the proposals provide robust ones. But objections on the basis of “slippery slope” or excuses that putting the work into enforcing those safeguards will take effort, is lazy, abusive law-making.Talk of “killing” and “assisted suicide” is dangerously misrepresentative. Choice of assisted dying is not about ending le, but compassionately supporting informed, veried inidual choice in ending death.To default to the current regressive laws condemns too many dying people to futilely torturous deaths, despite every palliative care possible, against their confirmed choice. The choices of the dying matter.Caroline Brocklehurst, Gfnock, Glasgow.  STARMER’S LACK OF INSPIRATIONNO -ONE wants rid of this rancid government and mess of a Prime Minister more than I do. However, Keir Starmer’s recent speech shows that he lacks political instinct.Nowhere was this more evident than when parading his patriotism, with multiple references to the Queen at a time when even hard-line royalists are questioning the use of royal fundsbeing used to shield ‘Randy Andy’, as he was playfully called by the pop press back in the day.Then there’s Starmer’s defence of Tony Blair’s knighthood. Yes, Blair has been given a free pass by the media despite the Chilcot Report, and has even been lauded for his entirely wrong advice on the vaccine world has vaccines.The media is not the people, and the people despise Blair.Yes, Starmer also had a go at the dreadful Corbyns, but he still sounds like a man looking over his shoulder for inspiration rather than looking like a leader.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.  POWER OF ENGLISH NATIONALISMIN this brave new world we must never underestimate the power of British or English nationalism.In the s the dogmatic force of Margaret Thatcher prepared the way for a devolved Scottish Parliament.In the s the corrupt chaos of Boris Johnson will pave the way for an independent Scotland probably also the same for Wales, along with a united Ireland.In modern times, with plummeting personal polls, Boris is possibly the worst Prime Minister ever. However, like Maggie, he is a positive catalyst for Scottish independence.Tory party leaders remain opposed to devolution and continue to undermine it, even as Boris talks up his “precious” four nations.The fact is, English nationalism now controls the Tory and Labour parties as the disaster of Brexit continues to create havoc throughout the UK.Grant Frazer, Cruachan, Newtonmore."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13356658.jpg?type=article-full","title":"new-ways-tackle-glasgows-low-recycling-rates","story":"For my building we have inidual wheelie bins, some of which are jealously guarded, and we are responsible for taking them out of the back garden to the roadside for emptying.At some point in the year we moved to an eight-day rolling rota for bin collection but a week was skipped and no one was surethis meant that the rota kept going or repeated a week.By \"no one\", I dont only mean my neighbours but also the woman who answered the phone at the council when I rang up to ask. She insisted they were emptied on a Saturday, which hasnt been the case for some time.So each week is a bit of refuse roulette. One person takes their bin out and then everyone  copies, hoping and praying that the initiator knew what they were about.I had a sneaking suspicion as to who had filled my bin upso I tried to put my bin bag in their bin. Foiled again: it was full to the brim with cardboard.You can see the neighbourhood recycling point from our bin shed. Its literally  seconds walk away. What was going on  Abject laziness  Confusion  Who doesnt understand, by now, that cardboard can and should be recycled I fished it all out from their bin and mine, broke the boxes down flat and took it to the recycling. This is who I am now. Fun at parties  You betcha, yes, sir.Online shopping cardboard made up the bulk but also food delivery boxes. Everyone everywhere seems to order these food delivery boxes now and, every seventh or fth or eighth day when the bins go out, you can bet theres cardboard boxes sitting on top of and next to the normal bins.Whats the correct etiquette for dealing with this  Other than writing a newspaper column and hoping the recycling refuseniks read it.In December, Sepa released its latest recycling figures for Scotland, which didnt make many headlines. According to the environmental agencys data, household recycling rates fell by three percentage points on the year before. Glasgow, despite the poor efforts from the folk around me, actually increased its recycling rates.Dont be too excited though the city is still the worst performing local authority on the Scottish mainland.In Glasgow, we recycled just .% of our rubbish. Over the border in East Renfrewshire that jumps to .%, which is the second highest after Angus on a whopping .%.The councils communities convenor Mark Salmond attributed Anguss success to improvements in kerbside collection and a redesign of recycling centres. \"Absolutely delighted,\" Mr Salmond said of his warm feelings towards residents efforts.Angus has invested a signicant sum in recycling facilities and introduced a raft of measures, such as its Special Waste Action Team and Community Clean Up and Fly-tipping Prevention Fund.I was reading of a council in England that sent officials to peoples doorsthey were seen to be putting the wrong rubbish in the wrong bin. It wasnt about enforcement, apparently, but just having a friendly chat and faintly shaming people into doing the right thing.In a similar yet more gentle vein, Christchurch city council, in New Zealand, launched a scheme that saw officials stick large gold stars on the wheelie bins of successful recyclers and remove bins of those who fail to recycle properly.Ideally we want reuse rates to trump recycling rates. My friend gave me my Christmas present wrapped in familiar paper. Familiar because I bought it. Last year. Hes kept it a full  months and reused it this year. Genius. Im doing the same thing but Ive made a note of who gted what so that no ones offended by it ending up back in their possession.Surely, though, its a compliment. I cared enough to buy such good quality wrapping paper that it endured a second use a year later. Ultimately, youre giving the gt of trying to save the future of humanity. Youre saying, \"I care enough about you to try to ensure a future for your children.\" And think of the money saved.Its a lot of effort, though, reusing and recycling. Reusing, particularly horribly disposable items like wrapping paper and gt bags, should be the norm with no shame in re-gting or re-wrapping,its possible, which is an excellent festive message to bear in mind for next year.Recycling, though, is a right nuisance. Washing out milk cartons and cans, collapsing boxes, getting the last of the peanut butter from the bottom of the jar.Photograph by Colin Mearns September \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Bales of crushed aluminium drinks cans at Glasgow City Council#s Blochairn recycling facility in Glasgow.Photograph by Colin Mearns September \" class\"editor-image\"Its not an enjoyable chore, and everyones busy, so the question is how to improve recycling rates. How to persuade people that peeling infinite labels from infinite bottles is worth that extra step.One way, in Glasgow, would be making recycling points more accessible. Yes, mine is mere feet away and yet people within spitting distance still cant be bothered to use it. But I also frequently see people driving up to it. If youre having to drive to get to a recycling point then its too inaccessible to be regularly, easily used.On the other hand, having recycling bins right on the doorstep creates a danger of being too accessible: ideally people should be throwing less waste away overall, sorecycling is a little bit tricky then people are more inclined to reuse.Glasgow is a patchwork of dferent recycling and refuse systems, which have been designed to deal with the iety of residences across the city, but which dont all work.My friend lives in a tenement flat in Mount Florida where he and his neighbours received a rather chiding letter telling them that the food waste bins were being removed due to the residents failure to prevent contamination in their bins.Someone stole my food waste bin off my front step years ago so its not something I think about but, now that it occurs to me, I cant remember seeing any of my neighbours putting out the little grey bins either.They definitely still exist as Im cat sitting in the west end of Glasgow at the moment and Ive just moments ago put an apple core in a food waste bin. Unless its redundant here too and Ive spent years leaving rotting food waste for the owners to find when they come home.Glasgow City Councils Resource and Recycling Strategy - reports that residents have a thirst for increased and clearer information on recycling, and the council makes a pledge in the same document to provide it. Yet its also withdrawn food waste recycling.Strong messaging to encourage behavioural change, ease of access and consistency - three vital elements to improving our dire recycling record and ensuring instead a gold star for the city entire."},{"url":null,"title":"ant-dec-worried-limitless-win-bankrupt-itv","story":"The programme will see contestants compete for the worlds first unlimited jackpot.In total five hour-long episodes will air, with the first kicking off at .pm on Saturday, January .McPartlin told the PA news agency: “We did worry that we were going to bankrupt ITV.”Speaking on what he thought made the show stand out from the crow, McPartlin added: \"I think ours is dferent because the answer to every question is a number, and it’s very simple, and everyone can play along.😮😁😠😬😃😳☺️ It’s a rollercoaster of emotions🎢 😂 Are you ready !

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I know Davy was struggling and found it tough,” said Potter.“A Dutch guy living in the UK in lockdown, so he didn’t get to see much of his family and friends and that was an added pressure.“I would say it was even a little bit before with Davy.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

If Covid is in that room everyone is going to get it.”Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan urged Ms McIlveen to outline a plan that will put the safety of pupils, parents and teachers first.“The priority for everyone needs to be on ensuring that our schools cansafely and that staff, children and parents are protected,” he stated.“The Omicron iant and rising cases is increasing the pressure on school staff.“The Education Minister needs to come to the Assembly to set out a clear plan for keeping schools open which puts the safety of pupils, teachers and parents first and deals with the pressures on school staff caused by rising infection rates.”The Department of Education has been asked for a response.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenMore On Department of EducationNo plan to close Northern Ireland schools despite Stormont recallAssembly likely toearly to discuss schools crisisEducation Minister says schools can move to remote learning and reduced timetables in event of staff shortagesHome schooling ‘not a viable option’ as Omicron iant threatens possible school closures PremiumParents warned to have back-up travel plans forto schoolMost ReadMajor security alert takes place onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International AirportWatch: Stormont row erupts over UDR book in background of Jim Allister during committee meeting‘Hearty applause’ for Royal Mail after service delivers letter to Co Antrim man using just his descriptionWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean Spar owner says Northern Ireland protocol has not damaged business – ‘We are expanding’Top VideosPlayVideo: Major security alert onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International Airport PlayVideo: Man appears in court charged with murder of Aidan MannPlay Larne FC tune released as local singer out to prove it’s a ‘cracking place’ ahead of Linfield clashLatest CoronavirusHealth trust apologises to grieving families after death certicate delays hold up funeralsFionola MeredithOpinionWho will stand up for the people who can’t wear masks Covid restrictions: Givan and O’Neill at odds over stricter enforcement of face masksDjokovic visa exemption is an injustice, says NI ex-pat in AustraliaMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestIrish Cup: Peter McCann’s Oxford Sunnyside relishing ‘biggest game in club’s history’ against Linfield at Windsor ParkDenzel Washington: Acting worked out very well for Chadwick BosemanNearly a quarter of ambulance handovers delayed by at least  minutesWitness appeal issued after man dies in Roscommon crashJames Argent celebrates ‘Adele moment’ after dramatic weight loss,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They style themselves like the Kennedys,” said Mr Collins.“They will be sitting in somewhere like Mauritius, eating sun-dried tomatoes and laughing at the rest of us.” Mr Collins said he believed the former PM knew what he was doing when he ordered the invasion of Iraq on the grounds, since discredited, that Saddam Hussein’s regime possessed weapons of mass destruction.“There were senior officers who perfectly realised what was going on and one of two things happened – either they didn’t press their case, or they told the PM exactly what was going to happen and what the outcome would be”, said Mr Collins.“I think the latter is the case, and Blair decided to ignore it and press on .”He added: “I think he was absolutely in love with himself and convinced that he was the Messiah.“One of the big ironies and laughing stocks was that he then became an envoy to the Middle East which would be a bit like making Jack the Ripper a special envoy to battered women.”In relation to Mr Blair’s role in the Northern Ireland peace process, which is believed to have contributed to the controversial award, the -year-old east Belfast native said that Sir Tony “fiddled around the edges” of the accord, resulting in a “much poorer deal”.The England-based soldier-turned-businessman said it was ex-Tory PM John Major and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern who deserved the credit for the Good Friday Agreement, while UUP leader David Trimble and SDLP chiefs Seamus Mallon and John Hume took all the risks.“Bertie Ahern and John Major had the republican movement and the loyalists by the throat and they knew it - and then along came the pop star Blair, handing out favours,” he told this newspaper.“The fact is, the men of violence were brought to the table by Major and Ahern.“The people who took the risks to bring the common decent people of Northern Ireland the table were Trimble, Hume and Mallon they were the people who did the hard work.”Mr Collins said Mr Blair’s contribution to the peace agreement left Northern Ireland in stalemate.“In a sweep, the cult of celebrity then turned the whole victory to Sinn Fein which meant the middle ground was abandoned and now we’ve ended up with where we’re at and have been for  years,” he said.“Both my we and I come from Northern Ireland we just look at the situation and think, ‘Good luck to you because you’re stuck in a rut with Sinn Fein and the DUP. It’s going nowhere’.“There’s no future for children, no money for health, no money for education, no money for infrastructure, inquiry after inquiry after inquiry... I feel sorry for the people.“% of people in Northern Ireland vote, the other % don’t bother - so you get what you get.”Sir Tony Blair has been contacted for comment on Mr Collins’ comments. Most ReadMajor security alert takes place onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International AirportWatch: Stormont row erupts over UDR book in background of Jim Allister during committee meeting‘Hearty applause’ for Royal Mail after service delivers letter to Co Antrim man using just his descriptionWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean Spar owner says Northern Ireland protocol has not damaged business – ‘We are expanding’Top VideosPlayVideo: Major security alert onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International Airport PlayVideo: Man appears in court charged with murder of Aidan MannPlay Larne FC tune released as local singer out to prove it’s a ‘cracking place’ ahead of Linfield clashLatest Northern IrelandKerry Beattie explains why she almost rejected chance to join Scottish champions Glasgow City from GlentoranCovid situation is ‘dire’ in Northern Ireland schools, says teaching unionCovid death toll in Northern Ireland tops ,Coleraine appeal to fans to avoid misconduct including sectarian chanting after fine by IFA‘We are winners at this club’: Ben Kennedy says Crusaders will use last year’s Irish Cup penalty heartache to fire new trophy tiltLatestJames Argent celebrates ‘Adele moment’ after dramatic weight lossFortnight of further hospital admissions already ‘baked in’, NHS chief saysBrighton boss Graham Potter not surprised by Davy Propper’s early retirementBindi Irwin unveils new tattoo made using her late father’s handwritingWe don’t want a bailout says boss behind British Gas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

An exhibition will be held in the Millennium Forum and will run during the Feis Between April  and April . There will be a special prizewinners concert April  which will feature former Feis competitors such as Bronagh Gallagher, Margaret Keys, Gerald McCrystal, Eoin OCallaghan and others are yet to be confirmed. Feis Committe member, Patrick MacCafferty, spoke of more plans for the celebrations, As part of the centenary, I have been involved in recording a number of songs and music which would have been performed at the Feis over the years, he said. It involves artists that have gone on to make their careers in music such as Doreen Curren, Mairead Carlin and Fergal Murrey.The hope is to produce a CD which will be on sale. Also, a number of special competitions have been included in the Irish language such as, Write a manesto on your hopes for the Irish language for the next years, in poetry,a short favourite poem, in storytelling, a story or folktale about Derry.There are also musical competitions in every genre.  Patrick continued: Feis means everything to me. I have spent my whole le competing. I have been on the committee for some time. Easter has always been Feis week in our family.You may have got away on Easter Sunday, but the rest of the week was Feis. My grandmother sang in a choir at the first Feis, and my grandfather was on the second committee. My father competed in the Feis in the late th century and he was the official accompanist from  until he passed away . Feis is part of me. It is more dficult to sum up what it means to Derry. There is no doubt that in the early days it was the only place to express your talents, it was the only  for many but now thereare many outlets. One thing is certain that when you look at the talent that started their careers on the Feis stage such as Dana, Roma Downey, Frank Gallagher, Paul Murphy, and many more, it has done more than its fair share for this great town in taking our name abroad. In November , Derry and Strabane District Council voted unanimously to support theFeis Doire Cholmcille Committee, as theymark this incredible milestone. Commenting on the motion, Aontuacute Councillor,Emmet Doyle,said: “The Feis Doire Cholmcille has been a cultural staple throughout the last  years in this city. Going back to Tuesday, June  to Friday, June , , the first Feis which was organised in conjunction with the Gaelic League. It is steeped in history, indeed on the third day of the first competition around  participants took part. In the late s there were around , participants. “The committee that runs Feis is made up of volunteers, they put so much time and effort into this event, they are real cultural ambassadors when it comes to Gaelic culture in this city and district. “Over the hundred years of Feis Doire Cholmcille some of the best talent of this city and across the island have come through the competitions of the Feis. It is just as important to those who value gaelic culture as those who value the Jazz Festival, as Halloween, as St Patrick’s Day and should be treated as such.” DUP Alderman, Hilary McClintock, agreed the Feis is ‘an institution within this city’. Ms McClintock said: “Many young people have not only taken their first step to fame and stardom, they have developed confidence and self esteem which has stood them in good stead throughout their lives.” Sinn Fein Councillor, Emma McGinley,added: “A few of us will have our own memories of taking part in the Feis growing up. We have no doubt the centenary should be celebrated.” As part of the centenary year, the Committee are also doing a few exhibitions with pictures and memories over the  years. They wrote: To complete the set of  Feis Books for the Centenary, we are only missing the year, .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Visit Invest NI to learn more about the grant and whether you are eligible.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

Michelle McIlveen, to urgently revisit her approach to managing Covid in our schools. googletag.cmd.push Pupils are set toto class in a few days time after the Christmas break with uncertainty still around on how both they and staff should adapt to the latest pandemic developments – namely the Omicron iant of the Covid virus. Mr Delargy said that school principals needed guidance from the top so that pupils and staff can receive reassurance that classes can be taught in safe conditions. He said: “The new school term is almost upon us and the Education Minister has failed to produce a plan to make our classrooms safer. “Principals have been open and honest in recent weeks as they describe the deterioration of the situation in many of our schools. “A lack of appropriate guidance, a lack of adequate safety mitigations, a soft touch contact tracing policy, and a lack of available substitute teachers have put many of our schools in dficult positions with many having to resort to partial closures. “The Omicron iant may also present new challenges, so I am urging the Minister to revisit her approach to Covid in schools. “We put these concerns directly to the Minister in the weeks before Christmas and called on her to produce a comprehensive plan which puts HEPAfilters in all classrooms, which sets out a contact tracing policy teachers and families can have confidence in and to speed up the redeployment of qualied teachers from non-pupil facing positions back into the classroom. “The Minister keeps telling us she wants to keep schools open. We agree, but it would appear she has squandered the opportunity over the Christmas break to develop a plan. We will continue to make the case to the Minister for a new approach to Covid in our schools.” The Secondary Students’ Union of Northern Irelandhave also called on the Department to provide more measures to help protect school pupils from Covid. SSUNI President, Morgan Shuttleworth, said: “The SSUNI believes that, due to the drastic increase in infections, this should be reflected in the assistance being given by the Department. “Education as a whole is being dragged under due to the staff shortages created by contact tracing, and so in order to keep schools open we must do all that we can to keep both staff and students safe. “The Union has repeatedly called on the Department to provide more measures, specically HEPA filters and air puriers, but there has not been any such movement.” A spokesperson for the Department of Educationresponded by saying that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. The said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available at NIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

Meanwhile, a new cemetery has been earmarked for a site on Mullenan Road.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Jan Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, says Council staff are to be commended after news that lands had been acquired for a new cemetary googletag.cmd.push The plot, close to Derrys border with Co. Donegal, at Mullenan Road is expected by Derry City  Strabane District Council to provide burial space for up to  years. However, there is also scope for the Council to explore further expansion into adjoining lands. Mr Delargy said: “We have seen major work take place in the City Cemetery over recent years, particularly at the Lone Moor Road end and the opening of new burial sites “I commend Council staff for their work to upkeep this land and for the compassionate services they provide to many people and families in dficult circumstances on losing a loved one. “But it is coming close to the time when the City Cemetery will reach its full capacity. “It can be a very long process to get a site that suits the needs of the city for the next twenty to thirty years and it’s vital that people’s views are heard and people are kept informed of the plans as this project moves forward.” A Council spokesperson added: “Following extensive technical reports and assessments it was agreed that the lands at Mullenan Road are the most suitable lands for this major development project. “The council will now engage with all relevant stakeholders in taking this strategic project forward.” Meanwhile, members of Derry City  Strabane District Councils Planning committee have unanimously approved plans to construct an additional  plots at the City Cemetery in Derry. Members were told that, as the applicant, Council undertook community engagement to inform the public of the proposed development and to seek their views prior to submission of the planning application. Attendees at the information session were told that additional parking spaces would be provided along the new access road into the cemetery. After members voted unanimously to approve, Chair of the Planning Committee, Cllr Philip McKinney, said that the plans would be welcome news for residents across the city area.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.

Pic by Sportsfile.Reporter: Liam Tunney Jan Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derry football manager Rory Gallagher is looking forward to a settled run of games after what he has described as a stop-start first two seasons at the helm. googletag.cmd.push The Oakleafers get their  Dr McKenna Cup campaign underway this Friday underneath the Owenbeg lights against Monaghan, with a weeks break to their second group game in Fermanagh. After a years hiatus, Gallagher has welcomed theof the competition, but is realistic about its place in his priority list. “Personally, Im delighted its back, and Id say the players are as well. Its competitive games. Its a lot more straightforward than the organisation of a challenge game,” he told the County Derry Post. “All being well, there will be spectators there, and its a far better environment for both experienced and newer players to play in. “Any of the friendlies you play are with a purpose, theyre competitive as well, its just far better to have the environment of a stadium pitch, so were delighted. “Unfortunately, since we got involved, with the nature of Covid, things have been relatively stop-start, and even last year, we only really played six competitive games. “Its not a dream at the start of the year to win the McKenna Cup, but at the same time, would I like to beat Monaghan and Fermanagh and get another game  I absolutely would.” Steelstown will face Moortown in Sundays Ulster IFC final. Pic by Mary K Burke. Derry club sides have had a hugely successful season, with Steelstown in Sundays Ulster intermediate final and Glen and Desertmartin only seeing their season end shortly before Christmas. The Glen players have ed to training with the county, but Slaughtneils hurling success means their county footballers will be involved in the upcoming All-Ireland club hurling campaign. However, Gallagher says the players have not been entirely absent from the intercounty scene. “We thought the split season was in, and it would have been great for everybody, but even on the football side of it, the provincial championships should have been tidied up before Christmas,” he said. “The Slaughtneil players will be focused on their All-Ireland club semi final, but weve learnt the lessons from a couple of years ago, when I first got involved and they were at the same stage. “Theyve been good, theyve kept their eye in with us as well and have been at a number of our sessions, and you have to give their management credit as well. “They know the type of iniduals they are – the McKaigues, Brendan and Shane – theyre very serious about both sports. “They havent been doing a huge amount of on-pitch training with us, but were very happy with their involvement to date and were trying to work together. “Well have a view to all being ready for the first round of the league, no matter what.” A dejected Chrissy McKaigue and Gareth McKinless leave the field after defeat to Donegal. Pic by Sportsfile. On the face of it, last year was positive for the Oakleafers. The county won Division  in some style, achieving their aim of promotion to Division . A good championship outing against Donegal ended in heartbreak, but Rory Gallagher grants little currency to gallant failure. “We wouldnt have deemed it ourselves to be overly successful. We expected to come out of Division , we wouldnt be giving ourselves a clap on the back for that,” said the Fermanagh native. “We expected to beat Donegal and we didnt. Thats the disappointing thing, we feel we left it behind us. We always try to maximise our potential in the squad, and thats the challenge for all of us. “There are two games in the National League before theres a break and everything is geared towards preparing properly to give us the best chance of winning those games. “Well go into those games against Down and Offaly and then well get a break. I imagine its the same for all counties, but January is a very hectic month. “You have the obvious thing of Slaughtneil and Steelstown, but we have guys involved with Sigerson, some involved with Freshers teams as well. “Its about making the most of the periods of time we have all the players together and managing the situation to allow us to perform in those two games and review it after that.”  Tributes paid to one of Derry GAAs greatest unsung heroes  Seamus Mullan, who was influential in the redevelopment of Celtic Park, passed away today.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

McDermotts calming influence helped Banagher seal a Derry intermediate title, as well as paving the way for their run to the clubs first ever Ulster hurling victory and final appearance. Pic by MT Hurson.  A tight corner back, McNicholl had a solid season, helping his team to a county final, where they hung onto Slaughtneils coattails for a signicant period. The young defender showed energy and ability in a full back line that was sorely tested against the Derry and Ulster champions in the final, but McNicholl stood up and looked the part throughout. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McCloskey sat at the heart of the Banagher defence and performed the role he has for years with his customary no-fuss and high level of effectiveness. Unerring in his defensive responsibilities and appetite for a battle, Ruairiacute Roe has relished the inidual duels with opposition attackers, as well as marshalling the defenders around him consistently. Pic by MT Hurson.  Shted around in the Ulster series, McGuigan had been a confident figure at full back, and took advantage of his man-marking role further out the field to point against Dunloy. Any attacker coming into direct opposition to McGuigan found it dficult to have a major impact on the game as he helped Slaughtneil to a ninth successive Derry title and fourth Ulster crown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Aggressive and committed, Farren earned praise from fellow half back Mark Lynch after their county final win and was named man of the match. His intensity and industry formed a key part of a resolute Banagher defence, and he often popped up as the man who delivered the ball into the opposition half. A very solid season from the Banagher man. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Bradley has the sweepers role down to a tee and was excellent in the recent Ulster wins over Dunloy and Ballycran. His versatility is key to the Slaughtneil system, slotting seamlessly into the deep-lying role, while on occasion being pushed further up the field during games in which the Emmets look like they are in control. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Hitting - in the Ulster semi final, McGrath has added an extra dimension to his game this season and was a thorn in the side of the Dunloy system. His physicality and incessant running leaves opposition half forwards often looking over their shoulder for the burst forward, or the defence-splitting passes that feed Slaughtneils talented inside forward line. Pic by John McIlwaine.  One of two Slaughtneil men making both the football and hurling teams of the year, Rogers has been unstoppable. From rising from his sick bed to hit - against Dunloy to repeating his goal heroics in the Ulster final, his record speaks for itself. Usually stationed further forward, he is thoroughly enjoying his role in the centre of the pitch. Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile.  With a physicality and fitness that takes him up and down from the full forward line to midfield regularly, Foley drove Na Magha to within a whisker of the Ulster JHC final. His accuracy and consistency from frees gives his side the cushion of a few points heading into any game and his versatility was clear during the Ulster series of games. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  Top-scoring with - in the county semi final win over Ballinascreen, Bradley was the man Lavey looked to to try and turn things around in the final defeat to Banagher, and his late free set a few St Marys hearts fluttering. He has the energy and commitment to torture the most attentive half back, while his accuracy from frees ensures any discretions are punished. Pic by Mary K Burke.  ODoherty recovered from a shoulder injury to take his place against Dunloy and Ballycran, firing over frees and moving defenders around just ashed never been away in the first place. Whether supplying quality ball from deep positions, or slotting scores at the other end, journalists are advised to bring an extra pen where ODoherty is concerned. Pic by John McIlwaine.  Lynch performed superbly in the county final win over Lavey, and was influential as Banagher dug deep in their semi final win over Swatragh. A passionate performer, his non-stop movement troubles defences and he has the composure and experience to find big scores at crucial times to help St Marys over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McKeever had another good season in both club and county colours, and was arguably Derrys intercounty player of the year. He showed both the physical presence to win his own ball and a keen eye for goal. Hit a point in the county final against a strong Slaughtneil defence and can look forward to another good season for both Derry and Kevin Lynchs. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McGilligan racing off after scoring the goal that finally defeated Swatragh in the IHC semi final is an abiding image for the year. A real threat when he is moved inside, and equally when left around the middle of the field to allow his physicality and skill to win contested ball. If played at the edge of the square in their Ulster final, expect a titanic battle with Rory Porteous. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rogers goal against Dunloy caught the eye, but the strength and composure shown by Cassidy to catch the ball, hold off Ryan Elliott and pop it to Rogers while on his knees deserves recognition. Often described as the unsung hero of the Slaughtneil attack, Cassidys industry and clever movement are the key that unlocks even the most tight defence.

Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.Reporter: Liam Tunney Jan Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derry could be without four experienced players for their opening McKenna Cup match against Monaghan at Owenbeg on Friday. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul, Padraig Cassidy and Gareth McKinless are all carrying knocks, while Conor Glass sustained a hamstring injury during the week. McFaul is thought to have picked up a knock during Glens Ulster SFC semi final defeat to Kilcoo in December. The Oakleafers will also be without Donncha Gilmore and Ben McCarron, who face Moortown in Sundays Ulster IFC final for their club Steelstown. While their five-strong Slaughtneil hurling contingent are unavailable due to their upcoming All-Ireland club semi final against either Ballygunner or Kilmallock, manager Rory Gallagher said they have been training with the squad. The Slaughtneil players will be focused on their All-Ireland club semi final, but weve learnt the lessons from a couple of years ago, when I first got involved and they were at the same stage, he said.  Young stars join up with Derrys provisional football squad  A number of the All-Ireand winning minor team are training with the seniors.   “Theyve been good, theyve kept their eye in with us as well and have been at a number of our sessions, and you have to give their management credit as well. “They know the type of iniduals they are – the McKaigues, Brendan and Shane – theyre very serious about both sports. “They havent been doing a huge amount of on-pitch training with us, but were very happy with their involvement to date and were trying to work together. “Well have a view to all being ready for the first round of the league, no matter what.”  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry GP, Dr Tom Black: We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks.Local NewsIn an exclusive interview with The Derry News, Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, says no new restrictions will stop virus figures rising over the next few weeks as Omicron iant is already baked into the system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The family of late Bobby Mullan have donated pound, to Altnagelvin Hospital in his memory Newsletter DerryNowAltnagelvin receives pound, donation from family of late Bobby Mullan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Glass has sustained an injury on ing to county training.

Runners-up Slaughtneil have two, with Loup taking three and Lavey the remaining one. googletag.cmd.push  Bradleys error against Kilcoo stands out because it was so uncharacteristic. His metamorphosis into a championship-winning goalkeeper has been so complete that these kind of errors are rare in his game. The Watty Grahams mans accuracy and speed of thought have been crucial as his side ended a -year wait to lt the John McLaughlin Cup. Pic by Mary K Burke.  As well as getting his hands on the John McLaughlin Cup, Carville found himself sticking over a point in the Ulster championship meeting with St Eunans as the captain led from the back. His form was as inspirational as it was consistent, and he drove the high levels of commitment and determination needed to ensure Glen delivered on their promise. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  When Slaughtneil were all at sea in the final, Rogers stepped out of defence and swung over a point. It didnt look like being the Emmets day, butanyone was to get them going, it was going to be him. Derry GAA supporters must wish they could clone Rogers, such is his influence and ability in both codes. One of two players to make both teams of the year. Pic by Mary K Burke.  An ever-present at full back for the county champions, Dougan has been a solid presence throughout the championship campaign against some of the provinces top forwards. Like many of his Glen team mates, the full back has not looked out of place among Ulsters elite, mixing it with the best and coming out in credit to relate the tale. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  Doherty has had an astronomical rise since the chance to play in a MacRory final was snatched away by Covid. He was key to a fine season with Derry and a senior championship win with Glen. Now a mainstay for both club and county, Doherty is someone the opposition will actively be looking to stop when they scan the teamsheet. A remarkable season for Doherty. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  McFaul has had an incredible season. Stationed at centre back, he has acted as the pivot for Glen, hurting opposition teams from deep and orchestrating attacks from the number  position. Continuing the form shown for his county early in the year, he has been the driving force behind Glens final deliverance of the sought-after county title. Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile.  McGills scoring threat from deep positions was a mark of Laveys last few seasons. He notched a point in the quarter final win over Ballinderry and a goal in the semi final against Slaughtneil. With pace to burn, the Erins Own man has plundered opposition halves with abandon, and has the stamina and tenacity required to be just as effective in his defensive role. Pic by Mary K Burke.  That Glen laboured without him against St Eunans is a mark of how important Bradley was to their operation. On his , he bossed the game against Scotstown and was excellent all season. The Watty Grahams midfielder has put three or four solid seasons under his belt and continues to improve year on year. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  Reinventing the high catch in midfield, Glass achieved this season that for which he came home from Australia. The face mask only added to the intrigue as he dominated midfields all year. He came home from Australia with a goal in mind - win the John McLaughlin Cup - and he has helped his club to that accolade with some aplomb. Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile.  Devlin is a constant threat in a free-scoring Loup side and took Bellaghy for three points from play in the quarter final. His link play and vision were key to his sides success as they reached the semi final of the senior championship for the second consecutive year. Devlin is one of a number of talented Loup forwards and one to continue to watch. Pic by Mary K Burke.  The position of half forward is half workhorse and half linkman, and Mulholland performs the role admirably. On hand to take a pass and carry the ball into attack, he greases the wheels of the Glen machine. With energy and precision, he also has an eye for a score, and has popped up with important ones on a number of occasions throughout the season. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile.  Another of the Loup danger men, ONeill also scored - from play against Bellaghy, and has the ability to cause problems wherever he plays. The St Patricks man is a key component of a forward line who have now had a number of years to gel and overseen a consistent improvement year-on-year in the green and white jersey. Pic by Mary K Burke.  The highlight of Tallons season was volleying the ball into the Slaughtneil net in the county final, and his vision and ability to take his opportunities has been bang on this season. With a habit of arriving on the spot at crucial times, the corner forward has crowned a number of fine seasons by getting his hands on the Derry senior county title in . Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile.  McGuigans name was almost enough to strike fear into opposition supporters, and although he was curtailed well in the final, the Emmets man has had another prolic season. Led the Emmets attack with endeavour and style, balancing his exertions with a fine hurling season too to finish the year with a place in the Team of the Year in both codes. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Struck an impressive - from play in the quarter final win over Bellaghy, and was consistently a lively target man in the opposition half. Had a quieter game against the Glen juggernaut in the semi final, but OKane has been the go-to man in St Patricks inside line throughout the season, with his scoring record raising eyebrows.

Pic: Claudy Rovers Facebook.Reporter: Liam Tunney Jan Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A long-standing County Derry football club has taken the dficult decision to fold, citing a lack of playing numbers as the main reason. googletag.cmd.push Claudy Rovers, who competed in the North West Junior Premier League at their pitch, known locally as the Congo, announced the decision via their social media channels earlier this week. It is with a heavy heart that I write these words but after a committee meeting tonight the tough decision was made that the club is folding with immediate affect, they said. It just seems to be very dficult at present to get enough men to commit to a game of football on a Saturday and it has been a struggle all season to do so. The club would like to thank the efforts of everyone who has played, managed, volunteered, attended meetings, sold tickets, bought tickets, organised events, washed jerseys, sponsored the team and supported the team over the years. The team has given us many fond memories of trophy wins, trips away in the Irish Junior Cup and many a great days craic in the Congo watching the men in sky blue and white stripes all this won’t be forgotten.  County Derry Sporting Review: February  IFA inclusivity award for County Derry football club.   The news prompted widespread sadness, with many former members and former opponents expressing their disappointment with the clubs folding. Sorry to hear this I always enjoyed the games with Claudy Rovers with Curragh Rd and Newtowne. Always a hard battle on the pitch and great banter with them after, said one comment underneath the original post. Sad news many a battle we had in the Congo with Newbuildings but always a handshake at the end, the McDaids put some years into club, said another. One comment made reference to grassroots footballs changing status in modern society. It’s a matter of time for many other Clubs too. People used to mostly work Monday to Friday. Now they work by all week, they said. Football is less and less a priority for most now. It used to be the single most important thing in most players lives . Now after work comes everything  then football sadly. However, another expressed hope that the decision could be reversed at some stage. There may be a Phoenix moment in the future, keep focused, they said, adding Theres no Claudy with no Rovers.

Pic: Claudy Rovers Facebook.Reporter: Liam Tunney Jan Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A long-standing County Derry football club has taken the dficult decision to fold, citing a lack of playing numbers as the main reason. googletag.cmd.push Claudy Rovers, who competed in the North West Junior Premier League at their pitch, known locally as the Congo, announced the decision via their social media channels earlier this week. It is with a heavy heart that I write these words but after a committee meeting tonight the tough decision was made that the club is folding with immediate affect, they said. It just seems to be very dficult at present to get enough men to commit to a game of football on a Saturday and it has been a struggle all season to do so. The club would like to thank the efforts of everyone who has played, managed, volunteered, attended meetings, sold tickets, bought tickets, organised events, washed jerseys, sponsored the team and supported the team over the years. The team has given us many fond memories of trophy wins, trips away in the Irish Junior Cup and many a great days craic in the Congo watching the men in sky blue and white stripes all this won’t be forgotten.  County Derry Sporting Review: February  IFA inclusivity award for County Derry football club.   The news prompted widespread sadness, with many former members and former opponents expressing their disappointment with the clubs folding. Sorry to hear this I always enjoyed the games with Claudy Rovers with Curragh Rd and Newtowne. Always a hard battle on the pitch and great banter with them after, said one comment underneath the original post. Sad news many a battle we had in the Congo with Newbuildings but always a handshake at the end, the McDaids put some years into club, said another. One comment made reference to grassroots footballs changing status in modern society. It’s a matter of time for many other Clubs too. People used to mostly work Monday to Friday. Now they work by all week, they said. Football is less and less a priority for most now. It used to be the single most important thing in most players lives . Now after work comes everything  then football sadly. However, another expressed hope that the decision could be reversed at some stage. There may be a Phoenix moment in the future, keep focused, they said, adding Theres no Claudy with no Rovers.

So punctual in fact that East Down ACrsquos Sharon Madine missed the start of that race and so she talked herself into doing the K as penance.There were  starters with plenty of quality runners at the front of the pack, who were obviously there to do more than merely run off the turkey.The top five men broke  minutes with Gerard Heaney of North Belfast Harriers taking the win in ..The fastest female was Dearbhla Cox of Annadale Striders in ..

The top three finishers were in within the  minute barrier.In first place was Ben Branaghin a time of ..The top female was Gillian McCrory, representing St Peterrsquos AC, in .. East Down AC had four runners, all female and as mentioned, Sharon Madine was only there by default.Having got lost en-route and failed to get to the K start, she felt that the only way to save face was to run the K.She actually ran very well and in the end was happy to have doubled her exercise goal for the day. Her time of . placed her as th female out of  and was not that far off her personal best.This is impressive since she prefers K to K and also that she arrived with no intention of racing that distance.In addition the blustery conditions were not ideal for chasing times. Alison and Ella Carroll opted for the K over the K based on the later start and the chance of a lie in.It turned out that the rain had also eased by then so it was a good call. Alison ran a well paced race and was as pleased with her consistent splits as she was with her time of ..Ella has not fitted much training in as of late but with characteristic grit she ploughed on to the finish in a time of ..Mags Flynn slipped across the line between these two in a very respectable ..It was a well organised event with adequate parking and toilets. All entrants received a t-shirt and medal and even the poor weather did not detract from the smug feeling of achievement for those who turned out. Kudos to Glenn Grant for his efforts to make this happen.Meanwhile closer to home, the rain had cleared early on to give a bright mild day. Gordy Graham was out for the Burren Townland ten miler and said it was almost too warm.The contrast in the photos of this compared to the Belfast meet is marked. Gordy had a great race and took the win by a clear margin in a time of . but he was keen to point out that his closest adversary, Brendan Heaney, was denied the chance to race it out when he took an unfortunate tumble.Gordy had the good grace to help his rival up but it seemed that the fall took its toll and Brendan never really got back on track.He did hold on to second place but he was four minutes behind Gordy in the end. Another podium for Gordy to end a successful year. It was no surprise to find that Niall Gibney was in the mountains on Boxing Day.However, this time instead of a solo escapade, he had signed up for the annual Turkey trot organised by BARF .This arduous run started at Meelmore Lodge then headed up the lane to the Mourne Wall. The climbing continued up to Trassey Track Ford and then up to the Bernagh-Meelmore col.Niall said that the paths were like mini streams after the deluge on Christmas Day and he described the river crossing below the col as ldquointeresting.To others that probably means practically impassable but the runners toiled on finally reaching Meelmore-Meelbeg Saddle.Our intrepid mountain man reported that, ldquoFrom here the brakes were off and it was a fun fast slippery downhill to the Happy Valley. A further treacherous stretch took them along the Mourne Way back to the lane to Meelmore Lodge.A run like this requires agility as well as stamina, so not all would be fit for the challenge and indeed it was a select field of  who set out.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent.

Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar.

This body of work celebrates the humanism and psychological dexterity of us all, both inidually and as a gender sector.ldquoWorking as an inidual to support equality for both males and females is wonderful.ldquoBut, by working together to achieve it as a society. Then we are invincible and real change can happen.She added: ldquoThis is especially relevant during these unprecedented, pandemic times. Where the glass ceiling still remains almost permanently unbroken.ldquoMore importantly, domestic abuse has increased horrendously, behind shut doors during the  months of lockdown.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason is supporting the event.She said: ldquoWomen are key to the fabric of our society and the day to day working of our world. Yet, we still see women disproportionately under-represented in areas such as education employment and leadership. No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job. More work does need done to address this problem urgently.Agreeing with both councillors, Lise said: ldquoWhat the councillors are saying is so true. So passionate am I to keep female equality high on the public agenda, itrsquos the focus of the creation and touring of this exhibition. It is at the core of my lsquoI Am Womanrsquo Arts and Cultural Programme.She added: ldquoI am focused on promoting all forms of equality and ersity in Northern Ireland.The I Am Woman programme was first launched at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in September and was attended by MLAs and VIPs.But Lisersquos work is not just focused at reaching the ear of politicians.She said: ldquoMy personal agenda is more about reaching out and spreading the necessity for equality, in all formats. In all walks of our society, from both a ground level up and top down.ldquoI feel that we all have a moral responsibility, when it comes to supporting and promoting female, and other, equality here in Northern Ireland. Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now. Otherwise, females will continue to be treated as second class citizens in Northern Ireland, for generations to come.ldquoBoth males and females have so much to give our society. In order for a fairer, more democratic society to exist. Females should always be treated equally at all levels.Lise added: ldquoAfter all, it is women who make up the majority of the adult population in this country.This is Lisersquos third project to be showcased at Parliament Buildings.Any school or business interested in hosted Lisersquos exhibitions and or workshops should email LiseMcGreevyPhotographic@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13354288.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Graffiti warning against an Irish Sea border at Larne portThe text of the  Act indicates that the regular meetings of Stormont’s  Executive ministers must “provide a forum for the discussion of, and agreement on,issues which cut across the responsibilities of two or more ministers”.In addition it says that the Executive meetings should also “have theof discussing and agreeing ... any signicant or controversial matters” which fall outside of the Executive’s main budgeted programme for government.All this is then re-stated in the text of the Ministerial Code that governs the behaviour of ministers.In short, Mr Bryson has presented a kind of legal double-whammy: namely, that the Protocol is both “cross-cutting” and “controversial”, and therefore in either one of these cases the Executive is obliged to discuss it – at which point unionist ministers could veto the checks.Mr Poots said relatively little about the report on Wednesday.Then today he told the Nolan Show “we need to have the support of the Executive to implement the port checks”.Mr Nolan pointed out that Sinn Fein is pledging to block any attempt to put such a discussion on the agenda of the upcoming Executive meetings .“Not allowing it onto the table won’t stop me carrying out my responsibilities – which would be to stop the checks in association with the law as defined in the Belfast Agreement,” he replied.“It would appear to us we need to have Executive support to continue to carry out the checks, therefore that will go to the Executive.“In the absence of that coming forward, we’ll make that decision.”Asked whether that decision means stopping the checks outright, Mr Poots replied: “That is the case... I need the support of the Executive to carry the checks out.“In the absence of Sinn Fein putting it on the table then the checks would stop.”Having earlier said he will bring the issue of the Protocol before the Executive by the end of the month, he today said it will in fact probably be within a week to  days.Mr Poots had come under fire throughout most of last year because the checks which have been carried out on food and farm goods entering Northern Ireland from GBwere being performed by his own staff in Belfast, Larne, Warrenpoint and Foyle, as well as Belfast International Airport.More from this reporter: Click here: Kate Hoey voices fears over influence of anti-Union ‘activism’ in NI courts and media as fresh protocol report published Click here: Jamie Bryson claims victory over Protocol: here’s precisely how the loyalist believes he has found a way out  Click here: Bryson – It’s high time unionists weaponised the law as ruthlessly as republicans——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The volume was, Conspicuous Gallantry, Anthony Leask’s book on the service of the men and women of thBattalion of the UDR.“Workplaces should be neutral spaces,” Mr McHugh said yesterday. “Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable in their workplace. The role and record of the UDR is one of violent state-sponsored sectarianism. Mr Allister’s prominent display of this book during a Committee meeting had the very real potential to cause offense to the many victims of this now disbanded force.”The reference work Lost Lives gives a detailed breakdown of all the murders carried out by terror groups during the troubles, as well as deaths caused by legitmately armed security forces, both north and south. It lists deaths caused by the UDR as eight while by contrast the IRA claimed  lives. The INLA claimed , UVF  and UDA .

The UDR was responsible for .% of deaths.Mr Allister said that as he was working remotely “frankly the contents of my study are none of his business”.He added: “I note, however, that a book which testies to the bravery of the security forces in facing down the threat of terrorism raises such ire from republicans simply by existing! Sinn Fein IRA are so intent on whitewashing the shameful bloody record of the Provos that they cannot so much as tolerate Mr Leask’s excellent book being in my study.“Having blocked a centenary stone, a rose bush for the centenary and a tree being planted for Her Majesty’s Jubilee Republicans now move to try to dictate the content of my study because they are so easily offended!”During the exchange, committee chairman UUP MLA Steve Aiken openly chuckled while noting that not only did he have the same book visible from his shelf during video calls, but that he had many other items relating to his service in the Royal Navy also on display from his study. He was not working remotely during the hearing.The committee clerk turned to Mr Aiken and said he was not aware of any assembly rules that would govern items in Mr Allister’s study but that he would look into it. Asked some  hours laterit had found any rules which might regulate Mr Allister on the matter, an assembly spokeswoman said: “We have no comment to make at this time.”DUP Finance Committee member Ulster Keith Buchanan has said the objection by Sinn Fein is an insight towards their true attitude towards the British identity in Northern Ireland.“Most MLAs were embarrassed,” he said of the Sinn Fein interjection. “We have serious business to do and Sinn Fein’s greatest concern is the contents of someone’s bookshelf.“Sinn Fein defends and celebrates the most heinous of murders by the PIRA yet is offended by a centenary stone, a rose bush, a Queen’s jubilee tree and now a book about the UDR. It would seem that Sinn Fein’s so-called ‘new Ireland’ will have its own banned book list. The unscripted view put forward in a Committee meeting demonstrates a lot about the true Sinn Fein attitude and towards the British identity in Northern Ireland.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDr Frank Atherton, who has been given a knighthood for services to public health, said the past two years have been “really dficult”, but added there is “great strength” in the UK making “collective decisions” to combat the virus after each UK nation imposed dferent rules around the Christmas and new year period.Dr Atherton, of Penarth, told the PA news agency: “Coronavirus will continue to evolve and what we need to do globally, here and in the UK, is to make sure our surveillance is good, that we can spot new iants as they arise, as we did with the Omicron iant.“When new iants arise they need to be very rapidly assessed in terms of their transmissibility and how dangerous they are, how much harm they cause to people.“So I think that will be something of a new normal for us in the UK and here in Wales, we will probably need to look at vaccination perhaps on a seasonal basis, in the same way we do with an annual flu booster, but that’s a little bit speculative.“We just need to to get through this wave of infection and see what the future brings, but I am confident we can come to terms with this virus, that it’s never going to completely go away, but that we can come to live with the virus.”He said his honour was a recognition of the “team effort” of all health professionals to keep people safe In Wales, groups of a maximum of six are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants, while licensed premises can offer table service only.A maximum of  people can attend indoor events and up to  can be present for outdoor events.Other nations in the UK have taken a dferent approach, with the most relaxed restrictions in England.Dr Atherton said: “I’ve always felt throughout this pandemic that there is great strength when we have collective decisions and we have common process..remove“We’ve tried, my fellow CMOs and myself, we’ve always tried to ensure that happens to the greatest degree possible.“Obviously the ways of transmission have occurred at dferent times, in dferent countries, and dferent countries have made their own responses.“In Wales, ministers have tended to be more cautious then in some other nations and that’s generally been welcomed by the population here – our public surveys suggest that people generally feel that the Welsh Government has done a reasonable job of keeping them safe.“Some iation is inevitable, but where we can have common solutions that is a strength of the system as well.”Congratulating Dr Atherton, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said he \"continues to play a vital role in tackling the ongoing pandemic and I’m pleased to see his work recognised\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe latest modelling suggests Omicron cases will peak \"towards the second half\" of this month and then decline – probably more quickly than previous Covid waves.Since arriving in the UK at the end of the autumn, Omicron is now the \"dominant\" form of the virus and is \"seeded in all parts of Wales\", the first minister told BBC Radio Wales this morning.More than , new cases of Covid were reported in a single daylast week, and the nations positivity rate – the number of tests thata positive result – is at  per cent, a figure Mr Drakeford called \"really high\".\"The dficult January that we could see coming is I’m afraid with us, and the protections in place are really necessary to help us all get through the challenging weeks ahead,\" he added.There is some optimism the Omicron wave could fizzle out as quickly as it managed to spread here, as it appears to be doing in South Africa, the nation where the iant was discovered in November. And research suggests people are far less likely to fall seriously ill or require hospital treatment with Omicron, compared to the Delta strain.Mr Drakeford urged caution against \"learning too many direct lessons from South Africa\", but accepted thatthe same pattern – of Omicron infections falling as quickly as they rose – were repeated in Wales, then \"we’re in for a very challenging few weeks but that we may come out of the other side of it more quickly than we’ve done in previous waves\".Wales is currently at Alert Level Two, with restrictions mainly aimed at improving safety measures for businesses and public places, rather than closing them down.The first minister said he believed his government had taken \"proportionate measures\" at the right time last month, based on the threat of the Omicron wave. This included closing down nightclubs, but Mr Drakeford said this was a move copied across much of Europe, and clubs were generally accepted to be at a \"particularly acute\" risk of being \"super-spreader events\"..removeBut asked whether his government would have preferred a full lockdown during the current wave, the first minister said this would have been impossible without financial support from the UK Government.Englands approach to Omicron has been less restrictive, as seen on New Years Eve when Newport city centre was a comparative ghost town compared to the crowds in Bristol. Boris Johnsons reluctance to impose further measures in England would make it dficult for any devolved government to win Treasury backing for a lockdown where.Mr Drakeford suggested the playing field was not level, in terms of funding any future restrictions.\"We have had this long-standing argument with the Treasury in London, that when English ministers decide that they need to move up the levels, they know they can draw on Treasury money to do so, and we and Scotland and Northern Ireland are not in that same position,\" he said. \"So we would not be able to move to [Alert] Level Four measures on our own, because level of support you’d need to offer to the Welsh economy in those circumstances is simply beyond what the Welsh Government ourselves are able to mobilise.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA leitmot of the French presidency over the next six months will be the need for greater autonomy for the region.Mr Macron has been championing the idea since he took power five years ago and will use the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, which sets the political agenda of the region, to try to put it into practice. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron, right, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference after a meeting at the Elysee Palace Speaking during a joint press conference with the head of the EU’s executive arm, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Macron said the bloc will finalise this semester the EU’s so-called strategic compass, its geopolitical strategy that focuses on defence capacity building.“It will allow us to have a common European position at Nato and to act together in a more co-ordinated way,” Mr Macron said, adding that he wants to develop Europe’s defence industry and increase the bloc’s technological autonomy.Amid lingering tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Mr Macron added that the EU will also build proposals for “an architecture of European security”, which is still largely dependent on the US and Nato.Mr Macron and Ms von der Leyen earlier paid tribute to two leading European figures at France’s famed Pantheon, honouring the memories of Simone Veil and Jean Monnet. vw,vw,px, px\"Giant portraits of late French politician Simone Veil, right, and diplomat Jean Monnet, left, are displayed outside the Pantheon in Paris Veil was a Holocaust survivor who repeatedly broke barriers for women in politics.She spearheaded the fight to legalise abortion in France and was the first woman president of the European Parliament..removeMonnet was a founding father of the European Union.Both Mr Macron and Ms von der Leyen wore masks during the visit inside the domed building, amid a wave of coronavirus cases that somewhat overshadowed the beginning of the French tenure and caused trouble for the French leader ahead of the arrival in Paris of EU officials.Mr Macron, who is expected to seek re-election later this year, made headlines earlier this week by using rude language in reference to the country’s minority of unvaccinated people.In an interview with a newspaper, Mr Macron described his strategy for pressuring vaccine refusers to get coronavirus jabs by using the word “emmerder” – rooted in the French word for “crap” and meaning to rile.His vulgar language dominated news broadcasts and provoked angry reactions from his political rivals.To move things forward on the continental stage on the vast array of touchy topics he wants to tackle, Mr Macron will need to adopt a more consensual tone with his EU counterparts. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron, third right, speaks with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, third left, during a meeting at the Elysee Palace With the coronavirus pandemic flaring in Europe and amid diplomatic tensions at the external borders of the EU, Ms von der Leyen said she was pleased “that a country with the political weight and experience of France assumes the presidency of the council at such a delicate moment”.“Because the voice of France speaks loud and clear, and France has Europe at heart,” she said.Among other main themes France wants to promote are the introduction of an EU minimum wage, a carbon tax on imported products and the reform of the EU’s fiscal rules.France also wants to accelerate discussions between member states to find a consensus on the stalled overhaul of the bloc’s asylum system..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: France takes EU reins with push for more sovereignty article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
