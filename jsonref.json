In the old days, the party demanded fanatical belief now mute complicity will suffice.Of course, China’s plans are not just for domestic consumption. The country is exporting its surveillance and artificial intelligence technology all over the world.And other autocracies are eager buyers, keen to ape China’s authoritarianism. Western democracies are also supplicants — as Britain proves with its courting of Huawei, hailed by Chinese police as being a ‘close partner’ in ‘technological’ and ‘digitalised’ police work.The technological export drive is part of China’s concerted effort to expand its global influence. Until the recent past, the Beijing Government was deeply reluctant to play any role on the international stage, preferring to concentrate on domestic problems. But again, all that has changed under Xi Jinping, whose outlook combines socialist ideology with nationalistic pride.The latter impulse is demonstrated in a host of initiatives: in the massive expansion of China’s military in the funding of Chinese institutes in Western universities and think tanks in the control of Chinese student associations overseas in the creation of global propaganda machines like the television’s ‘Voice of China’ whose European headquarters was recently set up in London in the vast Chinese investments in Africa and South America in the support for colossal infrastructure projects like Britain’s new nuclear power plant at Hinckley Point and in the ferocity of response to any attacks on Xi’s regime.The brave and proud Hongkongers out in the street are a living rebuttal for the party’s claim that the Chinese aren’t cut out for democracy. And that is exactly why our governments should stand by them.Xi’s regime has shown that it sees itself in ideological competition with us. Through its slide back to totalitarianism, it has rejected our values and tries to undermine them. For the sake of our own future, we must be willing to defend them.Kai Strittmatter is author of We Have Been Harmonised: Life In China’s Surveillance State, published by Old Street Publishing at £9.99."},{"url":null,"title":"Fifty love letters sent Leonard Cohen woman inspired Long Marianne sell 700K","story":"Share this article One letter from 1960, in which Cohen wrote about being ‘alone with the vast dictionaries of language’, was bought for £45,000 having been predicted to fetch just £8,000.

This is a wrongheaded and mean policy forced upon the BBC by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, who should not have been allowed to load the cost of his damaging social and economic policies on to the corporation. Even worse, the Conservative government has broken a 2017 election promise that the licence fee would remain free to pensioners over the age of 75 for the duration of this parliament. It is the politics of the absurd for Downing Street to ask the BBC to revisit a “disappointing” decision after forcing the broadcaster to enact a policy the Conservative party had promised it would block.Unless the policy is reversed, the BBC will become a welfare agency that means-tests elderly people. It will be obliged to push through a cruel and unnecessary benefit cut that will affect 4.6m households which have no way of increasing their income to pay for it. Even taking into account those rich enough to pay and those exempted through pension credit, at least 2.5 million poor pensioners face an annual £150 bill. For more than a million of the oldest people in our country, television is their main form of company.Mr Osborne’s licence fee wheeze was to compel the corporation to agree to shouldering the expense out of its own £4bn licence fee income. But handing out free licences would have placed an ever-growing burden on the BBC’s finances. If it were to allow over-75s to continue watching for free then the BBC would have to have found about half a billion pounds in savings. That figure alone should put pay to the idea that somehow a few celebrity salaries could be cut to fill the gap. Mr Osborne and his ilk in the Conservative party do not care one jot for the potential extraordinary reputational risk the BBC faces. Such Tories perhaps have never thought much of the idea of universal public services cared little about enriching democratic debate and informing citizens or about the cultural consumption patterns of the nation.They perhaps could not see the problem if the BBC ends up taking a frail pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years they have had for free. This is a blindness brought on by ideology. This crude piece of politicking compromises the BBC’s independence. Of all the possible candidates for leadership of the Tory party, it seems only Sajid Javid’s team has understood this. This will not be lost on the Conservative members due to elect the next prime minister, who are likely to be closer to 75 than most of the population.About half a million people have already signed the Age UK online petition demanding the government takes back responsibility for funding free TV licences. There is an obvious opportunity to do so. Although the funding of the free TV licence regime ends in June 2020, the government will begin discussing the BBC’s funding settlement in 2021. Any costs incurred because of the over-75 strategy by the corporation between June 2020 and April 2022, when the new licence fee begins, should be covered by the government without jeopardising BBC services.From then onwards, if the state believes that pensioners should have free services, it ought to pay for them. The UK’s licence fee model, in which advertisements or subscription fees are not part of funding, is also present – but far more expensive – in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Britain’s media market is large enough to make investment here worthwhile, but not so big that there’s no reason to export. Netflix will set up a UK office Apple TV will launch and Amazon is hiring. It’s true that the BBC can loom too large in parts of the media landscape, but it faces being shrunk by US media giants and a politics inimical to public service broadcasting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a34fc8a42b579bf99e36b1549d7cb37f84c323e/0_526_6576_3947/master/6576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c8d3df0fc9180af6a20599f11ee4eb","title":"jed mercurio binge watching beyond the line of duty","story":"Marathon sessions in front of the TV are fine for some, but the thriller writer knows how to draw out the suspenseAccording to a survey by RadioTimes, binge-watching is not the benign addiction that it appears to be. Almost one in five respondents said they had called in sick to work just so they could watch television, while half said they had watched more than eight hours in one go.I blame the United States. At least Britain has decreed that six episodes is plenty for a series. When I was heavily involved with The Good Wife, its 24-episode seasons really ate into my time. And I’ve been trying to watch Gilmore Girls for years and am yet to break the season three barrier. Will Rory ever get to college? I can’t tell you. It’s so long.Netflix is credited with the advent of the binge-watch and it has certainly made it easier to sleepwalk into pressing “next episode”, but DVD box sets paved the way. My binge-watching era reached its peak when I was living alone in an unfamiliar city in a new country. When the pressure to go out and meet people and take every single last bit of it in got too much, as it often did, I’d stay in and plough through whatever I could find. I came to Broad City that way and I galloped through Orange Is the New Black and Friday Night Lights. It was escapist and comforting and I still feel a particular fondness towards those shows for that time.But in my experience, the dedication that binge-viewing requires waxes and wanes. There is a constant pressure to keep up, because there is so much good TV being made (you could argue, though, that there is as much overindulged, nonessential claptrap) and gorging oneself on it may seem like the only answer. There is relief to be found in acknowledging, simply, that it is impossible to see everything and it is OK not to try. That is what Gogglebox is for.I am in a non-gluttonous period of viewing, mostly. I now prefer frugal consumption, portioned out weekly. It takes the pressure off and tightens the suspense, particularly when it comes to thrillers.Let’s call it the Jed Mercurio approach. With Line of Duty and Bodyguard, Mercurio knew how to end each episode with a doozy of a cliffhanger and in making the audience wait a week for the resolution, he turned both series into hits and, more crucially, talking points. To gorge on them all at once would have ruined it. Sometimes, more is less.Jonny Greenwood, guitarist of Radiohead, composer of film scores and the man whose working relationship with the film-maker Paul Thomas Anderson ticks every one of my favourite nerd boxes, found himself in the unlikely position of navigating the public shame playbook with perfect ease. When hackers stole a MiniDisc archive of Radiohead material from the OK Computer era, demanding a ransom of $150,000, the band decided to release all 18 hours of it on Bandcamp as MiniDiscs (Hacked) – which does not sound unlike a Radiohead album title – for 18 days, asking people to pay £18 to download 1.8gb of it. “Never intended for public consumption (though some clips did reach the cassette in the OK Computer reissue), it’s only tangentially interesting. And very, very long,” said Greenwood, in a statement. The money will go to Extinction Rebellion.It is the musical equivalent of being blackmailed over stolen nudes and deciding to leak them yourself. It takes away the power of theft and it is a very 2019 post-shame kind of move. However, as one of those hacked Radiohead demos played on BBC Radio 6 Music, I thought about Jai Paul and the flipside of that kind of stealing. The singer-producer’s work has been hugely influential, even though official releases were scarce, but in 2013 demos for his debut album were stolen and leaked online. He has only now released new, excellent music and spoken about that experience.“I understand that it might have seemed like a positive thing to a lot of people – the music they had been waiting to hear was finally out there – but for me, it was very difficult to deal with,” he said. “I was in quite a bad place for some time.”Radiohead could turn it into a positive, but for others the violation is clearly far more damaging.Kylie Jenner threw a themed birthday party for one of her best friends and that theme was The Handmaid’s Tale. Quicker than you could say: “It’s what Margaret Atwood would have wanted”, Jenner found herself on the receiving end of lots of people furiously suggesting that reenacting an authoritarian hell-vision in which women have no rights and are legally raped is somehow unsuitable as a backdrop for cakes and candles.This is an era of poor-taste festivities. After the success of his brilliant series Chernobyl, Craig Mazin was forced to ask tourists to the region to “comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacrificed”, as he posted on Twitter, owing to a wave of new visitors perfecting the art of the nuclear disaster selfie. But two years ago, Vice reported that people were holding their hen and stag dos in the exclusion zone, so an ill-thought-out pout really is the least of it when it comes to what should be considered appropriate behaviour.In the spirit of if you can’t beat them, I’ve decided to join in and ride the bad-taste wave. For my own birthday, I will be throwing a Kylie Jenner’s Handmaid’s Tale-themed party theme party. Bonnets and lip kits are mandatory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de35b4fb7de02f4129f49c906334a451a85169d6/0_495_7350_4410/master/7350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1270266831fdac3cf9eb08ebbc925633","title":"the rise of the conscious consumer how to shop responsibly","story":"The way we shop is changing for the better, helped by a new breed of independent brands and carefully curated retail destinations, such as Coal Drops Yard, providing a thoughtful, ethical approach to consumptionWhen it comes to shopping, sustainability has never been more front and centre in our minds – from Adidas committing to using only recycled plastic by 2024 to Elle magazine dedicating last year’s September issue to sustainable fashion, and the ’s associate fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley stating: “I’m going to change what I wear and what I write about”. Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade.

The exam board’s parent company, Pearson, said the images “were circulated in a very limited way” before students sat the exam on Friday.“Having visited a small group of centres within scope of the investigation, we have identified one centre in serious breach of correct practice,” the firm said.“All students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.”Two questions from the paper first appeared on Twitter in a since-deleted post which offered students the whole paper for £70.It is not the first time Pearson has had maths papers leaked. Last year, an A-level maths paper apparently appeared for sale online the night before thousands of students sat the exam.The company was also forced to make last-minute changes to two A-level papers in 2017 after receiving reports that some students had gained access to them in advance.Both leaks were investigated by the police, with evidence passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought.In April, it was revealed that Pearson would pilot a scheme in which exam papers would be microchipped to track the date, time and location of each bundle.An online petition calling for the exam board to take the leak into consideration when it set grade boundaries has been signed by hundreds of students.The petition’s creator, Jenny Li, described the situation as “very unfair” for students who had not seen the paper before the exam.A student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was “frustrated” by the leak.“I’m not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper it wasn’t that kind of frustration,” he said.“It’s more the frustration that I’ve spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students through some sort of opportunity could have not learned anything for two years – and just spent £70 and got an A-level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b5d2d8b972e2616bb82625957a6132fbe3ecc5/0_98_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f1b48e0b72a949fc212e88ee7c3b5ae","title":"australias oldest things how mind boggling timelines meet the climate emergency","story":"They were here before us and should live on long afterwards. With 12 years to avert catastrophe, we need to imagine the aeons to come and consider the creatures that outlive usWilbur the tortoise has, in all probability, lived more than a hundred years.“From his size and weight and general health,” says Adam Lee, a reptile keeper at the Melbourne zoo, “we put him at about 110 but there’s no real way of telling with giant tortoises unless you have them from birth or as a hatchling.”Lee holds out a carrot and Wilbur snaps at it.He seems, in certain respects, even older than that – ancient, even prehistoric. He scrabbles on the concrete floor with ungainly dinosaur feet. When I stroke his massive shell, I can feel the scratches on the keratin. He snuffles as he eats, his leathery jaw jutting irritably, as if he were an aggrieved pensioner discussing franking credits.Yet the idea that this creature, happily munching his carrot, predates the first world war astonishes me.Lee explains that giant tortoises (or “GTs”, as he calls them) can live more than 200 years, perhaps reaching 250.This sounds preposterous. But I already know of Jonathan, a giant tortoise estimated to have been born in 1832 but still alive and well on the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.And there, at the feet of those long-dead gentlemen, stands Jonathan, looking entirely the same as he does in photos from 2019.On the day of my visit, Melbourne is blustery, so much so that Lee warns via email not to expect “much GT action”, since Wilbur and his slightly younger companion (perhaps 90), Little John, both dislike the cold.I can’t bring myself to complain, given the prolonged warmth of Victoria’s autumn.In our times, unseasonal temperatures – even when pleasant – fill me with a vague dread. The novelist Delia Falconer discusses climate change ushering in “a new age of signs and wonders”, in which the most commonplace occurrences (a warm evening, the absence of birdlife at a particular spot, an unexpected change in vegetation) feel fraught with ecological portent.“As the world becomes more unstable in the grip of vast and all-pervasive change,” Falconer writes, “it’s difficult to discern exact chronologies, relationships and meaning.”More than anything, I think, climate change politicises time.Lord Byron considered the sea “the image of eternity”. For us, however, it means flux and uncertainty, with new research suggesting the oceans could rise as much as two metres by 2100.“Time is money,” warned Benjamin Franklin, and the extractive industries built fortunes taking him at his word. Fossil fuels depend on million-year old geological processes so that, in a sense, industrial society runs by burning natural history.The emergence of Greta Thunberg as a global leader highlights the temporal inequity of climate change, a burden shrugged off by the old on to the young.According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have, perhaps, 12 years to avoid catastrophe – and one of those years has nearly passed. Yet, though we must act immediately, we need to imagine the aeons to come, planning for outcomes well beyond the threescore years and ten that scripture allots to a man.Hence my interest in Wilbur and the other creatures whose lives extend longer than our own.In 2007 biologists identified a 50-ton bowhead whale caught near Alaska as more than 115 years old by examining pieces of a particular harpoon stuck in its shoulder bone. Because whalers only used that patented variety of exploding lance for a brief window in the late 1880s, the fragments confirmed scientists’ suspicion that bowheads could live several centuries – providing, of course, they weren’t harpooned first.Three years ago researchers from the University of Copenhagen dated a female Greenland shark as 392 years old.As the ’s Nicola Davis explained, that means the animal “was born during the reign of James I, was a youngster when René Descartes set out his rules of thought and the great fire of London raged, saw out her adolescent years as George II ascended the throne, reached adulthood around the time that the American revolution kicked off, and lived through two world wars”.It’s a mind-boggling chronology, an illustration of just how wondrous our planet remains.Yet there’s a less ennobling aspect to the story.Where the Alaskan whale was classified by a projectile scar, scientists established the shark’s age because of an atomic bomb. The nuclear tests conducted in the 1950s sent spikes of carbon-14 into the food chain of the North Atlantic, which then provided a kind of date stamp, marking a particular layer of proteins as they grew on the poor fish’s eye.The oldest creatures carry marks from the people of the past and so remind us of the scars we’re already leaving on lives in the future. That becomes even more obvious when we turn from the animal kingdom to the realm of plants, the demesne in which the true ancients reside.When I ask the Australian National University’s Dr Matthew Brookhouse, an academic and forester, about the longest living trees in Australia, he tells me that a great deal depends on what classifies as life.“What we need to define is the age of what we’re interested in: is it the age of the organism or is it the age of the stem?”If we focus on the stem – the bit that looks like our traditional notion of a tree – then certain Huon pines can be dated as 2,000 years old, making them more or less contemporaneous with Jesus.“But what we see as the tree,” Brookhouse continues, “is really just the current aerial projection of the organism, like a potato or like a daffodil bulb. What’s lying below the ground is the longer term embodiment of that organism.”On that basis, particular clumps of Huon pine could be said to have lived for perhaps 11,000 years, with vegetative cloning rendering the “inidual” trees genetically identical.Other forms of clonal life stretch way back into deep time. A stand of king’s holly in Tasmania has been alive for an unthinkable 43,000 years, while the Wollemi pine of the Blue Mountains west of Sydney seems to have been cloning itself for even longer.There is, Shakespeare said, “no clock in the forest” and the Wollemi pine proves his point.Brookhouse specialises in dendrochronology, the science of tree rings. The field itself stretches way back in history, with the ancient Greeks aware that trees produced new rings each year and Leonardo da Vinci describing the correlation between ring thickness and climate.“Except for those very long records from ice cores, the temperature reconstructions ning thousands of years come from tree rings,” Brookhouse says. “Much of what we know about how unusual the current temperatures are comes from trees.”Experts described this year’s bushfires in Tasmania as “unprecedented”, with the blazes devastating some of the oldest forests in the state. King’s holly will, in all likelihood, become extinct in the wild, partly because of fires and partly from an introduced pathogen called phytophthora, something that also menaces the Wollemi pine.Does Brookhouse feel an emotional tug when studying such ancient trees?“Absolutely. I have a sense of quiet respect for an organism that predates us all.” He hesitates. “Actually, the emotional response to plants of that age is strongest when you see them deteriorating or when you see one die as a consequence of something we’ve done – really, in the blink of an eye, relative to the tree’s experience.”The Melbourne keeper explains that the reptiles and amphibians with which he works have been hit hard by the environmental emergency, with frogs, in particular, in the midst of a mass extinction.The giant tortoises once roamed in great herds (known, delightfully, as “creeps”) across the volcanic atolls around the Seychelles.“I wish I could have been there,” says Lee, giving Wilbur’s long neck a rub. “It is like a dream.”But sailors on the long voyages necessitated by the spice trade seized the giant tortoises as living meat stores, and now conservationists classify all the species as endangered.Wilbur came to the zoo from the Seychelles in 1965, back in an era when keepers could casually swap a koala for a tortoise.Since then, much has changed but Wilbur retains a long memory for his friends and for his enemies.“I spent a lot of time bonding with him,” says Lee. “At the start he’d be trying to bite me and over time the aggression diminished to the point where, when I came in, he would walk over and rest his head on my arm and let me give him a little scratch. He’s much better these days but there used to be two or three keepers that he was friendly with – and with all the rest he was aggressive.”“Well, as aggressive as a giant tortoise can be.”Without question, Wilbur’s age lends him a certain gravitas. He could, after all, live for another century or more – and, because of that, he seems almost a proxy for nature as a whole, separate from humanity and yet now dependent upon us.“We have pets and you generally know you are going to outlive your pet,” Lee says. “It is weird to think that here is another animal with which I have a bond and it’s going to outlive me. It’s humbling.”A single reptile or an organism as massive as the Great Barrier Reef: the fates of those other lives is now entwined with our own.Lee rubs the tortoise’s head once more.“I am here with Wilbur now I will do what I can to make his life positive. And then it will be someone else’s turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05c3669f2ac4a3182a7b2674956f9584129a886/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e539072eb64440398f0fffc32754b20e 960w","title":"heatwave florence plays host to ss20 menswear shows in pictures","story":"Givenchy’s elegant villa takeover, artist Sterling Ruby’s debut collection and a pool party celebration for MSGM – here are the highlights from the Pitti Immagine Uomo showcase"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385e883f8a4f0a5dcf2c853c419b0d0ea16133e5/0_0_3723_2233/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=775e15b9cc164b7e1d58a44df97183f8","title":"bread salad kale pine nuts roast lemon zuni cafe recipe meera sodha","story":"An inspiring dish at one of the city’s landmark restaurants has evolved into this sunny bread saladI ate the best bread salad of my life at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco in 2015, came back home and regularly ate a variation on it for at least a year afterwards.Over time, those variations became bolder and wilder, until just a faint shadow of the original existed. Hence today’s recipe, which adopts the currants, olive oil, pine nuts and bread of the prototype, but is in every other way different. Still, if we have anything to learn from all this, it is that where there is travel, there is inspiration, and where there is bread, make bread salad.Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 4 as a starter or side dish150g kale, big ribs removed, roughly chopped3 tbsp black olive tapenade – I like Belazu’s200g focaccia, cut into 15mm x 15mm chunks3 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 lemon, quartered into four wedges3 tbsp pine nuts3 tbsp currants6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to serve3 sticks celerySaltHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Throw the kale and tapenade into a food processor and pulse to smithereens. Taste, add a little more tapenade, if you like, then pulse again to mix.Put the bread chunks in a big bowl with the garlic, lemon wedges, pine nuts and currants. Drizzle over three tablespoons of oil and toss with your hands to coat. Tip out on to a baking tray so it sits in a single layer (keep the bowl to one side) and roast for 10 minutes, until the bread and pine nuts are golden – check after five minutes to make sure they’re not burning.While the bread is roasting, finely slice the celery and put it in the reserved bowl with the kale and tapenade mixture.Once the bread is golden, take the tray out of the oven and add everything except the lemon wedges to the bowl. When they’re cool enough to handle, squeeze the juice from two of the wedges over the salad, drizzle over three more tablespoons of oil and add a half teaspoon of salt, or to taste. Mix, mix, mix with your hands, until the bread soaks up some of the surrounding flavours, then taste again, adding a little more roast lemon juice or salt, if you like.

The 21-year-old is under contract until 2022 and Palace had no great desire to sell, but the youth-team graduate has made clear to his current employers that he would be keen to seize what he considers might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.The opening offer had included various potential bonus and additional payments which made the overall package more appealing, but Palace will only countenance a sale if the fee to be received is guaranteed to be in excess of £50m. Intriguingly, they could explore whether it would be feasible to remove a sell-on clause agreed when Wilfried Zaha was sold by United back to Palace in early 2015 as part of the negotiations. That would effectively serve to bolster the potential fee further towards £60m.Wan-Bissaka, originally a winger, enjoyed an eye-catching first full season in senior football last term after graduating through the south London club’s academy, excelling at right-back and making 39 appearances in all competitions. The defender is currently preparing for the summer’s junior European Championships in Italy and San Marino, with United hopeful they will eventually add him to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s options, with Antonio Valencia among 14 players to be released when their contracts expire at the end of the month. They have already secured the young Wales winger, Daniel James, from Swansea City.Palace are already exploring their options over a replacement for Wan-Bissaka, and contact has been made with the Belgian international Timothy Castagne. The Atalanta defender, capped five times, has spent the last two seasons in Serie A and made 28 top-flight appearances as they finished third and qualified for the Champions League last season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1dab10486f0278813b3ee85d1324fad23d46609/36_64_4634_2780/master/4634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8d1fed1f0ce188e69fc2542b38eb79d","title":"netherlands v cameroon womens world cup live","story":"77 min: Both teams a little ragged at this point. The Dutch look nervy while Cameroon are struggling to piece much in the way of attacking moves together. Onguene and Nchout are having to try solo efforts to force matters. 75 min: Final Cameroon sub: Enganamouit, who has tired, is replaced by Akaba. 73 min: It’s a corner to Cameroon. Can they exploit it? Nchout drills the ball low and the Dutch have little problem clearing their lines. 72 min: An Onguene break is tackled well by Dekker, to many cheers from the Dutch fans. Miedema gets a sighter at goal, but cannot get enough purchase on the ball. 71 min: Dutch substitution: Van de Donk, who has been quiet, comes off for Jill Roord, yet another Arsenal player. 70 min: Beerensteyn, down that Cameroon left, makes an impressive dart but is unable to find a team-mate. Cameroon break, with Nchout, who has played well since coming on, causing trouble. 68 min: Another Cameroon yellow. Martens cuts inside and is hacked down by Feudjio. 66 min: Dutch sub: van de Sanden for Beerensteyn. Cameroon sub: Mbelek off for Menene. 65 min: Onguene charges down the left, finds Nchout, but Yango’s shot is miles over. 64 min: Martens, who has been quiet since the opening moments, shows off her skills with superb control to make room to get in a cross. The left-hand side has not seen much traffic in this game. 63 min: More needle as van de Donk buys a foul by her own goal-line, receiving the expected clattering. 62 min: A look at that Miedema goal if you fancy.60 min: Cameroon sub: Abam goes off for Nchout. 59 min: The Dutch sitting back now, and looking to go the break. “We Will Rock You” rings out from those in Oranje, with backing of a band, which seems to have much more of a repetoire than that group of atonal Englishmen. 57 min: Cameroon mount a rare passing move in the opposition half but cannot get the ball to Onguene. Van de Sanden cuts into the box at the other end, but is tackled just at the moment of release before Miedema, on the end of a Groenen cross, slashes a volley wide. She couldn’t get her foot over the ball. 55 min: Another Dutch attack down their right, Cameroon’s left, but this time they can’t exploit that weak spot. Van de Sanden tries to find Miedema but the pass is cut out. 53 min: Rather unsporting jeers for Onguene as she leaves the field, though she will soon be coming back on, and to more unsporting jeers. 51 min: The Dutch fans back in full voice, and booing Onguene for staying down after another tackle on her. She looks in genuine pain this time as well. Van Lunteren came across her and knocked her to the floor. The Cameroon coach again up in arms on the sideline. An elbow is the claim made, but that doesn’t look to be the case. 49 min: That Cameroon defence has definite weak spot down its left and that’s twice the Dutch have used it to score goals. It didn’t help that the defence went to sleep. A well-worked free-kick, as the ball is played out to the right, the cross comes in for Bloodworth, who gets a second bite and scores from close in. 46 min: Let’s hope for more of that needle. Both teams have really been mixing it, with the Dutch getting distracted by all the shenanigans. Makes for good viewing, mind you. How Mbeleck was not sent off for that high kick I still can’t tell you. Off we go for the second half...That is probably a fair scoreline on the balance of play, as Onguene has been excellent for Cameroon and the Dutch were a little off their game. Miedema’s finish was superb, but she has not seen enough of the ball. 45+3 min: Spitse’s free-kick is cleared by the Cameroon defence, which is the last action of the half. 45 min+1: First corner of the game and it’s gone to Cameroon, which is cleared. The Dutch blaze to the other end and Miedema gets on the ball. She takes too much time on the ball and is crowded out. 45 min: Well, well. The noise in the crowd is now coming from the Dutch fans. There will be three minutes added on at the end of this half. The thorn in the Dutch side equalises just 150 seconds after their goal. A long ball is launched down the centre of their defence and Onguene seizes on it and finishes smartly. 42 min: Just as it looked Cameroon had knocked the Dutch off their game, Miedema, so quiet before, scores her first ever World Cup goal. She was unmarked and was never going to miss from there. Van de Sanden finally gets some space down the right and her cross is headed in by the Arsenal goal machine. 40 min: Cameroon pressing high and are cutting off the Dutch’s attempts to play across the back. 38 min: Yellow card! The Dutch have lost their mojo and the game is being reduced to a pitched battle. Mbeleck’s tackle on Groenen was decent enough but it was followed by a high follow through that reminds of Paul Gascoigne on Gary Parker in 1991. That could have been red as it looked like a loss of control. Gazza should have been sent off, too. He doubtless now wishes he had been. 34 min: Van Lunteren leaves the field but comes back on again, but only after a delay during which Cameroon mount an attack but fail to get a shot in.

Could I ever learn to love housework? Last Christmas, while I was visiting my parents at the house where I grew up, I watched Mum throw away some spice mix. Much of it missed the bin and the seeds, spices and herbs scattered about the kitchen floor. Mum didn’t notice, or didn’t care, so I grabbed a dustpan and brush. As I swept, I found plenty more down there: breadcrumbs, cheese, ham, porridge, dog hair, something sticky. Later, Mum mixed cocktails. I had come prepared, so, before taking a sip, I whipped a baby wipe from my pocket and gave my glass a surreptitious clean. Mum and my stepdad started talking about their plans to become Airbnb hosts, at which point I nearly choked on a cashew nut. They simply can’t see mess, I thought, and then I remembered that, until quite recently, neither could I.When I was growing up, the house was always untidy. There were piles of clothes on the landing, toys all over the living room, black marks on the hall tiles where coal had fallen from the scuttle we lugged in from the shed, dust on the surfaces, apple cores stuffed down the back of the sofa, discarded crisp packets, breakfast bowls on the coffee table, yellow gunge on the kitchen radio, and entire rooms we couldn’t enter because the doors were blocked shut by stacks of furniture, sculpture, paintings. I didn’t care: mess was all I knew, although there were hair-raising moments, such as when I was washing the dishes and saw something orange working its way up through the plughole. It turned out to be two slugs that had somehow got into the overflow. One Christmas, I accused the dog of having nibbled a bar of chocolate under the tree: “It was probably a rat,” said Mum, casually.Nowadays, I share a flat with my wife Lucy, and I’m tidy – perhaps obsessively so. As I scrub the floors and put things away after a meal, or use the vacuum’s special nozzle to suck up far-flung specks of dust on Sunday mornings, I think about how the untidiness I grew up in has affected important areas of my life – my studies, work, relationships. I’m nervous of broaching this subject with Mum, as I don’t want her to think I have complaints about my upbringing (I don’t). When I eventually ask her about it, Mum laughs and quotes my dad’s parting shot from 1988: “It would have been easier to stay if I’d been able to find a clean teaspoon.”Then she recalls a Friday evening when she took my brother Casper and me out for fish and chips: “I left the radio playing, the lights on, front door unlocked. When we got home, two neighbours were coming down the stairs. They said, ‘Thank goodness you’re alive.’ They thought the house had been ransacked and some terrible In Cold Blood-type scenario had happened. But the house was just in its usual state.”Mum also reminds me that, as a child, I liked looking at estate agents’ ads, particularly for new-build bungalows. “You wanted a house like Gary and Kevin’s,” she says of the charismatic twins at my school, who lived in a spotless beige house on a cul-de-sac. It’s true, I envied Gary and Kevin, but I thought that was because they were good at football. I never thought it was about tidiness. And anyway, when Kevin came to do some plastering at our house last year, he told Mum: “I used to love coming here as a kid.”On the other hand, I remember times when I did feel self-conscious about our home. A sleepover had to be abandoned when an asthmatic friend reacted to the dust. Another mate came for tea, refused to eat anything and the next day at school said our house was “scruffy”. We had a fight about that, so I must have been hurt. But we made up and, throughout the summer holidays, went fishing together and came back to my house at lunchtime, traipsing mud and pond water inside, to eat the sandwiches that Mum made for us.A few miles outside St Ives in Cornwall, the house was never squalid and remains full of colour, warmth and books. It’s a nice place to be. During the festive period, guests come over almost every evening for elaborate dinners and sit around the table long into the night, laughing, arguing and drinking mum’s damson gin. The living room walls are papered in Ordnance Survey maps of places of personal significance – north London, where Lucy and I lived Yorkshire, where we both studied Barcelona, where Casper lives, and various sites of my parents’ own formative years. The maps overlap, creating a disorienting family geography, while the flickering fire casts shadows across them. But why exactly has the house always been such a mess?Mum, a 68-year-old painter, sees it simply. “I could always think of something better to do than cleaning up,” she says. “It’s fruitless, completely non-creative. Tidiness is about fear of letting yourself go, but I think letting yourself go is when you can really be yourself. Both my husbands were useless about housework – but while women are judged for being untidy, men never are.”Did she ever feel embarrassed when people came over? “I hated it when they turned up unexpectedly. Certain friends always arrived when I’d just set something on fire.”So how exactly did I learn to be clean and tidy?I ask my university housemate, Will, for his memories of the year we spent living together. “I’m amused to hear you say you’ve become obsessive about cleanliness,” he says. “I’m not sure you even knew what cleaning was. I remember after about three months, I discovered you dragging the bins through to the front of the house, juice dribbling on to the hall carpet. You didn’t know the bins were collected out the back, because until then I had taken them out every single week.”The following year, I moved back into university halls, in part because Will warned a potential flatmate that I was a nightmare to live with. I felt ashamed when I heard about that, but by then I’d started seeing Lucy.The first time Lucy came to my room, I explained that I only had one cup, so we would have to take it in turns to have tea. I had never washed this cup I figured I was the only one to use it, so – why bother? Fifteen years later, I remind Lucy of this and she says, “I didn’t drink the tea because the cup was disgusting. It was calcified brown, like a toilet bowl in a manky pub.”Still, Lucy enjoyed my company enough to see past the mug and we moved in together after graduation. Apparently I hadn’t improved. “It’s true that you didn’t see mess,” she says. “You moved through rooms, only seeing what function things had for you. You’d go in the bathroom, leave the toilet seat up, your towel on the floor.”Is that so bad?“I had to teach you basic things. I couldn’t understand why you were so ill-equipped for life. When I was a kid we took turns washing and drying after dinner. I learned lifelong skills, but also a lot of conversation with my parents and siblings happened around domestic chores.”What did she think the first time she visited my parents’ house? “I loved the jolliness, the friendliness, the colour. But I was taken aback by the dirt. I grew up in suburbia and knew people who kept plastic covers on their sofas. Your mum’s cooking was amazing, but the plates had congealed food stuck to them from the previous time they were used. The wine glasses were greasy.”Like Mum, I could always think of something better than housework to do. In our early years together, I’d tell Lucy to leave it, but she refused and ended up doing it herself. When I mention this to Alison Pike, a psychology professor at Sussex University, and co-author of a study about household chaos, she says: “If you don’t care about housework, you’re just not going to be the one who does it. Caring about stuff is gendered. There’s an argument to say that, instead of bellyaching about how men should do more housework, women should just stop doing it.” This is, in effect, what Mum did – her husbands did no housework and she refused to do much herself. (She did all the cooking once, when she was unwell, my stepdad made her a cheese sandwich which turned out to be a chunk of parmesan between slices of stale bread.)Circumstance forced me to take responsibility about five years ago, when Lucy started a job involving a long commute at the same time as I began working from home. I got quite good at cooking, which meant keeping the kitchen clean. I began to enjoy doing little things like sweeping crumbs or chopped herbs from the floor after dinner, polishing the hob with French lavender spray, wiping the wall behind the cooker, bleaching the sink after washing up and never leaving anything on the worktops lest we get mice. It’s rewarding, the nightly sense of completion involved in making things gleam, and Lucy says it’s a relief to know she no longer has to do everything. Although part of me can’t help but feel like I’m wiping away a connection to my past with every swish of the sponge.Today, my brother Casper is a chef, so he knows all about keeping kitchens immaculate. I’m curious to know what he’s like at home and how he remembers the house we grew up in. He Skypes me from Barcelona, where he lives with his partner Nici and their two small children.“I don’t think our house being untidy upset me,” he says. “I didn’t find it embarrassing when friends came over. My first girlfriend used to say, ‘Oh, I like it – it’s homely.’”Do Casper and Nici argue about housework? “We used to,” he says. “And maybe I was more relaxed about it than Nici. To solve it we hired a cleaner.”When Nici joins the conversation, I sense she feels more strongly. “Little things I don’t understand,” she says to Casper. “You open a chocolate bar and throw the wrapper into the sink. Why? And I don’t like it when you leave the food that falls from the children’s plates under the table.”“It sounds like we still have issues,” he says, before adding: “I guess I’m fairly comfortable in mess at home.”I want to know how far back the legacy of messiness goes, so I ask Mum what her childhood home was like. “My mum was always cleaning,” she says, “but she didn’t pass on her domestic skills. I think she wanted something different for me, but I probably took that on too wholeheartedly. I feel guilty about not passing on any domestic skills, especially now that you have become very domesticated. Your flat is a nest kept perfect. Would you have liked it more if we’d been very tidy when you were growing up?”I’m inclined to say no, but I know my untidiness cost me when I left home, and possibly earlier. At school, teachers said I was bright but disorganised in my written work. I’m a slow learner, which might have something to do with being untidy, and for a long time I felt as though my body was marked with some indelible dirt.It took me decades to learn that my untidiness was taking its toll on me and on others around me. But blaming Mum would be unfair. As Casper says, “She made up for it in other ways.” Mum created a stimulating, loving home and, like the mess in the house, our family relationships are out in the open – imperfect, and I think more beautiful for being so. Still, my dad and stepdad should have done a lot more housework. Later, Casper and I should have helped. Perhaps it’s not too late, although I am alarmed to hear that, if the Airbnb plans get off the ground, my stepdad is planning to make breakfast for the guests.

I love the robust beauty of the concrete and the well-proportioned interiors,” he says. “It was pure luck that I found a flat in this building it has many of the qualities I was seeking, which you just don’t find in the majority of new builds.”Trevelyan House was built in 1958 by Sir Denys Lasdun, the British architect behind the National Theatre’s boldly Brutalist design. Lasdun devised the then radical idea of a butterfly plan, which saw the rear unit on each floor of this block of flats set at right angles to the other two, with a central core containing the stairs and lift. Not only did this improve the aspect of each apartment, it also negated the need for long access corridors and gave residents more privacy while maintaining a neighbourly atmosphere. Its “cluster block” design allowed for 24 new residences to be created on a relatively small Second World War bomb site in Bethnal Green, without disturbing the existing character of the street.While Ewald was instantly enamoured of the thoughtfully configured flat, his fiancée, opera singer Louise Lloyd, took a little longer to adjust to life in the grey and boxy 1950s block. “When we started dating I was living in a modern apartment building in west London, just minutes from Hyde Park, which I loved,” she recalls. “It really was a testament to our relationship that I gave that up to move in here with Ewald. I didn’t have a huge appreciation for the architecture at that point, and I found the block a little unattractive.”They now share their two-bedroom Bethnal Green maisonette with their baby daughter, Maya. With its open-plan living area and split-level layout, the flat works extremely well for the young family, even though Ewald initially designed it for himself and a housemate. This is thanks to a considered remodel, which saw the original series of compartmentalised spaces reworked into a fluid, more functional floor plan.Ewald enlisted fellow architect George Bradley, long-time friend and co-founder of the pair’s studio, Bradley Van Der Straeten Architects, to help with the project. Together, the duo came up with a “room-within-a-room” concept for the lower level, where the kitchen is conceived as a separate cube slotted into the living area. As well as zoning the space, the design is an ingenious response to building regulations, which prevented Ewald from removing the interior walls.The cube itself is built from Plyboo, a sustainable material made from sheets of bamboo – it looks like oak but is stronger and more affordable. The exterior is clad in dark grey MDF (made using a coloured resin rather than from painted MDF), applied as panels to create the impression of a box rather than a partition wall. Shadow gaps also add to this effect – a trick borrowed from the ancient Egyptians – which can be seen where the structure meets the floor and the ceiling.The work was undertaken in two stages: the upper floor was remodelled in just six weeks, and then, a year later, it took two months to complete the lower level. “The design took longer, of course,” adds Ewald. “It’s quite rare as an architect that you get the chance to do your own house up, but we were lucky to have some extra resources at the studio to help, so I took a long time to plan what I wanted to do.”To complement the building’s architectural origins, Ewald originally decorated the interior with pops of primary colour and a mix of midcentury furniture. Louise has since added a few flourishes of her own, which required patience and a little persuasiveness on her part. “Ewald was a bit protective over the flat,” she laughs. “He saw it quite differently to how I did, and it took a couple of years to come to a compromise that suited both of us.”Love won out and now the home is a happy mix of both their tastes, with Ewald’s modernist pieces sitting comfortably alongside Louise’s cheerful tonal colour and tactile fabrics. “Everything we have now has been a joint decision – even the cushions,” says Louise, who has come to appreciate why Ewald was so drawn to the space to begin with. “Living in a maisonette feels almost like a small house, so it’s never claustrophobic, plus there’s always so much light coming in. The way Ewald redesigned the flat is really clever, and I now have a much greater appreciation of the architecture through experiencing it on a daily basis. It just shows that you should never judge a book by its cover.”Ewald is just as content. “There’s not much I’d change, other than adding bi-fold doors to open up the living area to the balcony. That would really make the most of the elevated aspect, and the sunsets and sunrises we get to watch. You feel very connected to the elements up here, and having a long view in London is such a luxury.”For details about Bradley Van Der Straeten, visit b-vds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c9274a1c714308c91b24d2a16e76277234e09f/45_186_2896_1738/master/2896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fb74eb732687824f8eb8ba7c8e3df3","title":"pregnancy social media fantasy and reality hadley freeman","story":"Where once just not vomiting in my hair was enough, now I’m supposed to wonder how cute my bump looks in my lingerie selfiesBy the time you read this I will be days away from having a baby taken out of my body – something that, even as I stare down the barrel of child number three, will never stop seeming extremely weird to me. So this is the last you’ll hear from me for a few months. Who will I rant to every week? Will the baby want to hear my thoughts on politics? If his or her first word is “Trump”, we’ll all know whose fault that is.I’ve been pregnant a bunch of times now: once with twins, now with one baby, plus assorted miscarriages and an abortion along the way. And what I’ve learned from what I think of as my 360-degree experience of pregnancy is that it is a lot like flying economy on a long-haul flight. It is so all-consuming, exhausting and uncomfortable that you can’t actually believe it will ever be over. But then it is you walk away and never think about it again, because the ultimate destination is a lot more interesting than the journey.But some people feel differently. Pregnancy is no longer merely something to be endured, but a statement about aspirational femininity. Where once just making it through the day without vomiting in my hair was enough, now I’m supposed to wonder if the oils I’m rubbing on my stomach are organic, and how cute my bump looks in my lingerie selfies. Because pregnancy has entered the Instagram era.This spring I was – I say this euphemistically – feeling the effects of pregnancy. This means I was – non-euphemistically – constantly nauseous and insane with fatigue. My pallor was more grey than glowing and any healthcare professional who asked how “mama” was doing was greeted with growls neither human nor animal. One day, as I was wondering if I should puke then eat another slice of bread or vice versa, an email arrived. “Deliciously Ella shares all of her pregnancy secrets,” it read. Deliciously Ella, AKA Ella Mills, is the wildly successful so-called “healthy-eating inspirer”, whose nutritional advice includes the theory that “to really thrive” we should cut out dairy, gluten, meat, fish and eggs. I read on, eager to thrive like the pregnant influencer: “Her morning routine includes a 7am yoga practice with breakfast being a berry and spinach smoothie with rice milk, almond butter and hemp seeds,” the email informed me. “Ella is curbing any cravings by enjoying fresh lemon on artichokes and healthy carbohydrates.”OMG! Just like me! As long as you substitute “artichokes with lemon juice” for “sweets with more sweets”. And does eating an entire loaf of sourdough between breakfast (bread) and lunch (more bread) count as “healthy carbohydrates”?It’s entirely possible that I felt so gross precisely because I wasn’t doing pregnancy the Deliciously Ella way. But how was I supposed to fit in yoga around my busy morning schedule of being sick? And I can tell you, making myself a glass of green sludge afterwards would not have helped.Like Mills, model Miranda Kerr has been documenting her photogenic pregnancy on Instagram. All the cliches of pregnancy-by-social-media are ticked off: laughably ascetic meals of toast, tomato and cucumber, exercise videos, “essential” beauty products that she is shilling, gently lit photos of her perfectly compact stomach being held by her adoring husband. Her clothes remain unblemished, even though it is scientifically impossible to eat during pregnancy without spilling at least half on your stomach. My maternity clothes are a homage to Jackson Pollock’s oeuvre, recreated in spaghetti sauce and baked beans, two foods oddly absent from pregnant influencers’ social media accounts.For a while I developed an indefensible fascination with the yoga teacher Hilaria Baldwin, AKA Mrs Alec Baldwin, whose enthusiasm for photographing herself in her lingerie remains undimmed four children down the line. “My purpose here is to normalie the postpartum figure,” she wrote under one such selfie, and if by normalise she means “suggest someone can have the body of a model hours after giving birth” then she succeeded. There is, it seems, a fine line between a woman inspiring other women in a thrillingly modern way, and a woman promoting her brand by perpetuating extremely conventional standards of beauty.Part of me admires anyone who can turn pregnancy into yet another product of our consumerist and patriarchal society, endorsing the idea that being 38-weeks pregnant is no reason not to be photogenic and high-achieving. But a much, much bigger part of me believes the kindest thing you can do for women is tell them the unfiltered truth. Nothing reveals the gap between social-media fantasy and reality more strikingly than pregnancy, so Amy Schumer has been an overdue antidote to all of the above. Throughout her pregnancy and since giving birth to her son last month, the US comic has been posting images of what motherhood actually looks like, in all its laughably undignified glory. “Guys what are we doing tonight?” she wrote beneath a photo in which she wears a customised nursing bra while attached to two breast pumps.I’ll meet you there, Schumer. And I’ll see the rest of you in the autumn.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

Currently, one in four UK workers have an account with Nest.Nest says it has not taken this decision lightly, “but we don’t think it makes sense to continue investing in an industry whose business model looks increasingly unsustainable”. It already has a tobacco-free policy on a couple of its funds.Commenting on the announcement, Dean Walker, a scheme member based in Portsmouth, says: “I’m a new dad and I’ll certainly be encouraging my daughter not to smoke when she grows up. Everyone knows it’s not good for you and can cause cancers, which I feel very strongly against.“I think what Nest are doing is a great idea and I hope more companies follow suit.”In 2017 it emerged that Nest was shifting a chunk of its investments into a new climate change fund designed to move people’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy. It said it wanted to protect members from the risks associated with the climate emergency by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas.It is predicted that by the late 2020s, one-third of the UK working population will have a pension pot with Nest. The average income of a member is around £18,000 a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e7aa861ddb730e8c2b5f0b9f2225940e47833d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cb7357ea6afc3019f22339b5c0894d","title":"letting fees ban agents urge landlords to increase rents","story":"The government has banned agencies from ripping off tenants – but there is evidence that rents are rising to offset the lossesThere were warnings that this month’s ban on rip-off tenant fees would result in rents being pushed up – and now  Money can reveal this is already starting to happen.Just two weeks after the ban came into force, a north London lettings agent has started telling its landlords to raise all future rents by £20 a month to offset the new costs they face. And it is unlikely to be alone in proposing such a measure.The move, which was this week branded by one landlord as “not in the spirit of the law”, had been predicted by some commentators, though few thought it would happen this quickly.Letting agent body Arla Propertymark warned in May that rents would rise by £103 a year as agents and landlords sought to recoup lost revenue. It now expects other agents to quickly follow suit, it said this week.At the start of June the government outlawed the £300-plus admin fees, the £100 credit-check fees and a host of often ludicrous charges that had become the bane of tenants’ lives. They could easily add £600-£800 to the upfront cost of renting a property. While tenant groups celebrated the ban, it was accompanied by threats from the property industry that rents would have to rise.It emerged this week that award-winning London letting agent Simon Clarke has been writing to its landlords with the increased rent proposal. The company, which has been in business since 1991 and has offices in Finchley and Whetstone, is to start charging landlords £240 for credit and other checks – on top of its existing fees. Prior to the ban, it charged tenants £432 for the same service. An online tenant credit check can be done for about £20.The letter seen by Money states: “Assuming you would like us to continue to fully reference and credit check prospective new tenants as and when your property becomes available, we need to inform you that an additional admin charge of £200 plus VAT known as a ‘tenancy set-up fee’ will be levied … and in addition to the letting fee. This is to cover the cost of this essential referencing service moving forward and shall include the right to rent immigration checks.”The landlord who contacted us to reveal Simon Clarke’s letter says he will resist the agent’s move to increase the rent. “I don’t think this is in the spirit of the legislation. There is little transparency in the fees, and I have little idea of how much the letting agents actually pay for credit checks, referencing etc. I’d rather that I, as a landlord, bear the brunt of these charges, not the tenant,” he says.A spokesperson for Simon Clarke told Money: “With the introduction of the tenant fees ban, we have had to pass on our costs for setting up a tenancy. In this time of increased regulation, particularly the recent rises in landlord taxation, we have advised our clients on how to ensure they can still cover the costs of their rental properties.”The agent also asked Arla chief executive David Cox to speak to us. “When the ban came in, we warned that rents would rise on average by £103 a year. What we have seen this week is what we predicted would happen … This is set to happen across the board,” he said.Cox pointed to research undertaken for Arla by the consultancy Capital Economics that revealed the fees ban is set to cost letting agents £200m a year, and landlords £300m. It also claimed that 4,000 letting agent jobs could be lost.Dan Wilson Craw, director at campaign group Generation Rent, says it is interesting that this agent is not attempting to pass on to landlords the full £432 sum it used to charge tenants.“Existing tenants aren’t affected – rightly, because there are no costs involved when there’s no change to whose name is on the contract,” he says. “As for the attempt to increase rent by £20 a month, whether this is possible depends entirely on the wider market – a shortage of homes sees rents go up anyway, but if the landlord is competing with newly built flats, they might struggle to get new tenants in at the higher rent.”In January the  reported that rents across Britain fell in 2018 for the first time in a decade, after years of inflation-busting rises. Figures from the Deposit Protection Service – a government-backed group that supervises tenancy deposits – showed that the average rent fell by £9 – from £774 in 2017 to £765.Reduced demand from tenants in places such as London, in part due to Brexit, was cited as a factor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e87dc506d483a10e5cd742451e8265f3d22c6596/0_143_5345_3207/master/5345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f3cae127a80cef856301cea12d10c1f","title":"what can i do to get rid of a moth infestation","story":"I need a cost-effective solution that doesn’t involve toxic chemicalsEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.Like many others seemingly, we have a huge problem with moths infesting our house.

What does it sound like?Wynton’s music sounds a lot like him and the life he’s led. The compositions take us from the introspection of a spiritual to the raucous celebration of a hootenanny, from a lullaby to a nightmare, and from a campfire to a circus. His consistent interest in playing and studying the music of Bach, Miles Davis, Beethoven, Ellington, Shostakovich, Coltrane, Bartók, Louis Armstrong, on and on, makes for an absorption and understanding of wildly contrasting styles that is unique.Why was working with Marsalis so important?The music affirms a belief I’ve held since childhood – that when we strip away our concepts of race, religion or culture, our DNA shows more similarity than difference. Both myself and Wynton always agree on one thing: we’re interested in seeking out those commonalities, and his music expresses a desire for coming together and understanding one another. I hope the recording speaks to those with a curiosity in crossing cultures, and in complex, colourful and uplifting music.Earlier this year you launched the Benedetti Foundation. What’s its aim?To advocate the role of music in schools and communities through workshops, and to provide support, information and inspiration to teachers. We won’t be looking to reinvent the wheel. I’ve been working alongside teachers and holding workshops for over 10 years and we will aim to address every level of instrumental music making, from beginners to conservatoire level. So much phenomenal teaching and music making is going on. The best gift I can give to anyone is to expose the best of what’s going on to those who don’t know where to find it.You hold positions with many youth music organisations including the NYO, National Children’s Orchestra, Sistema Scotland and London Music Fund. Are you aiming at the next generation of music professionals, or at music’s wider social purpose?Both! Music, if taught well, with love, passion and purpose, can provide life-changing experiences for many young people. My focus is not on trying to turn everyone into a musician but in a general enrichment of society, and challenging of the often negative images constantly paraded in front of young people. I also want to challenge and seek to improve the content of “music education”. Many professional musicians claim it does this and that, without being acutely aware of its content day to day.You started the violin aged four. By eight you were leading the National Children’s Orchestra of Great Britain. What was the secret to harnessing your own talent as a child?I was actually most engaged with the emotion and depth of the music. I wasn’t so interested in all the instrument’s pyrotechnics to begin with. I wasn’t really looking to win a race. Even aged six, I was moved to tears by music. Just listening to Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto, or the second movement of Bruch’s Violin Concerto, or Elgar’s Salut d’amour. I was driven by that desire to play, but I was also lucky to have a mother who understood you can’t give up at every hurdle. She taught us that there’s even deeper fun in true achievement.Millennials are reportedly tuning in to classical music. Can we ditch the idea of classical having an image problem?I’m not a fan of focusing on classical music’s supposed image problem. The race, culture and gender of the majority of composers we still play in concert halls is a fact. We can apologise for it, mask it, express dissatisfaction – it won’t change the past. Does it make Beethoven’s music less good or less powerful or less relevant? But music, in all its forms, can be studied, worked on, developed and created by anyone of any gender, race and culture. That is also a fact. If you have the exposure to it, it can become something to you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6376db94ac2bad70db65414ba0778714deb23ce4/0_288_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbeb488f5176f9747b6983ffcab15f19","title":"one to watch jordan rakei","story":"The Australian multi-instrumentalist is hitting his stride, with a breezily ambitious new album tackling our tech dystopiaDescribing an artist as “one to watch” upon the release of his or her third album might seem a little slow off the mark. However, it’s with his latest, impressive set that vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and producer Jordan Rakei is coming into his own.Rakei moved to London from Australia four years ago, and quickly became immersed in the UK scene. Though he appeared in 2015 on Masterpiece, from dance duo Disclosure’s Caracal album, Rakei is perhaps best known for his work with frequent collaborators Loyle Carner and Tom Misch.In his solo work, Rakei makes jazz-imbued sounds that lean intricately into hip-hop and soul alike. He has found fans in seminal producers such as Robert Glasper and Terrace Martin, while Nile Rodgers is also an admirer. It was after spending time in the studio with the Chic mastermind that Rakei decided to explore hookier, funkier territory than before.His latest LP, Origin, is full of a rich, cinematic musicality that feels poppier, sparklier and more breezily ambitious. Lyrically, too, things are more expansive and conceptual: yes, there are still considerations of love, dreams and anxieties but Rakei is also interrogating broader questions of technology and its disruption of everyday experience.As Rakei explained in a recent interview, “I had more lyrics about my life experience, but I wanted to test my own comfort zone and try to write something that projects my vision of a future dystopian world.”• Origin is out now on Ninja Tune"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c3a3195a367f08cd1c72c6fe5a7cd8bf29e6043/0_93_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feeb188083a5acd0c126dfbaf6fb1cd7","title":"sounds like summer best niche music festivals guide","story":"Festival Fomo?

But the Labour leader is facing a pincer movement from both sides of his deeply ided party.Another Europe is Possible, the anti-Brexit campaign group that works closely with leftwing Labour MPs including Clive Lewis and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, has announced that it plans a “summer of resistance”.Alena Ivanova, from the group, said: “What we’re witnessing this summer is the growth of a mass and plural movement against Brexit, with mass demonstrations announced for both July and October, and lots of different organisations holding speaker tours and preparing for a referendum.”She added: “But this movement needs to be radical, both tactically and politically – it has to become a hot summer of resistance, willing to disrupt the status quo.”Meanwhile Tom Watson, Corbyn’s deputy, has continued to push for a People’s Vote, and will make a major speech on the issue on Monday.Recriminations from the party’s poll performance have continued. Some shadow ministers, including some on the left, lament what one called the “malign influence” of Corbyn’s advisers, in particular his key confidant, Seumas Milne, and chief of staff, Karie Murphy, complaining that the pair insulate Corbyn from criticism and challenge.Several shadow cabinet members have told the  that Corbyn himself was uncomfortable with the party’s message in the run-up to the European elections, which he felt was insufficiently clear.“They’re clearly under pressure: I don’t think he’s happy with the way it’s working,” one said. Another claimed: “Even Jeremy, who has always held Seumas in awe, is increasingly dissatisfied with the messaging”.The shadow cabinet was not consulted about the expulsion of former New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for publicly admitting he had voted Lib Dem at the European elections. “No politician was involved in that decision,” said one senior party source.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was said by allies to have been particularly irked about Campbell’s expulsion, fearing it made the leadership look vindictive.The decision to drop shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry from prime minister’s questions at short notice last week, after she spoke out about Labour’s Brexit policy, also raised eyebrows.Corbyn was lambasted by colleagues at Monday’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), with one veteran of the Blair and Brown eras saying it was the worst they had witnessed, with Corbyn reading from a prepared script and failing to take on hecklers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

So we can presumably expect a couple more bowling changes pretty soon. Morris’s fifth over follows the recent pattern, bringing a couple of singles and not a lot else.19th over: Afghanistan 67-2 (Noor Ali 31, Hashmatullah 7) Still no wicket for Phehlukwayo, then, but another decent over for South Africa, just the single off it. Snicko shows a very slight edge, and the batsman is saved! You’d have thought that he’d have reviewed instantly if he was aware of the edge, rather than consulting Hashmatullah first, but whatever, it worked.The finger’s up, and that looks dead on! The umpire’s finger goes up, but Afghanistan go for another review.18th over: Afghanistan 66-2 (Noor Ali 30, Hashmatullah 7) A single off the first ball of Morris’s fourth over, and then five dots to finish. His first four overs have cost an average 2.75 apiece. Afghanistan are dawdling a little, and on course for an underwhelming 220.17th over: Afghanistan 65-2 (Noor Ali 29, Hashmatullah 7) Phehlukwayo gives Hashmatullah some width, and it’s cut away for four. The next is hit half-heartedly past cover for a couple, and that’s drinks. Both teams will probably be reasonably, but not overwhelmingly, happy with their efforts so far.16th over: Afghanistan 57-2 (Noor Ali 29, Hashmatullah 1) This is a lovely spell from Morris, who has offered absolutely no freebies and really bothered the batsmen. Afghanistan score three off the over though none of them are intentional, Hashmatullah trying to leave, failing and getting a single for it, and then Noor Ali edging for a couple to deep backward point.The ball would have clipped the stump, and that will very much do!Chris Morris thought so. The umpire thought so. Afghanistan hope not. There’s a chance it might have been missing leg stump...15th over: Afghanistan 56-1 (Noor Ali 27, Shah 6) Three overs into his spell, Phehlukwayo is yet to concede a boundary and is going at precisely 2.0 an over. There’s another edge off the last, this one bouncing past slip and away for a couple.14th over: Afghanistan 52-1 (Noor Ali 23, Shah 5) Morris is pushing and probing here, sending down little heat-seeking missiles programmed to locate the batsman’s edge. They’re just very slightly misprogrammed, keep narrowly avoiding the edge, and then Rahmat Shah clobbers the last over square leg for four.13th over: Afghanistan 45-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) Noor Ali gets a single, one of two scoring shots in the last five overs. 12th over: Afghanistan 44-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) A double change, with Chris Morris having a go now. He bowls an excellent yorker, with Shah getting an edge to the ball before it clatters his pads, which is what saves him. And then he edges the last as well, but it doesn’t carry to the keeper, who es to his right but can’t reach it, and is way short of Amla at first slip.11th over: Afghanistan 44-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) South Africa make their first bowling change, and it’s a drama-packed first over from Andile Phehlukwayo. First Shah goes for a sharp single, and Morris’s shy at the stumps hits a ot in the turf and bounces wildly, way over the stumps! Then Noor Ali edges, it’s gathered at second slip but the ball bounced a couple of inches before Du Plessis’ hands!10th over: Afghanistan 43-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 0) Shot! After four dots, Noor Ali cuts square away four, right off the sweet spot. Then the next gets a thick outside edge, but gets nowhere near reaching gully.9th over: Afghanistan 39-1 (Noor Ali 16, Shah 0) Rahmat Shah negotiates the last four balls of the over without scoring, or for that matter trying to score.Rabada with the breakthrough! Hazratullah pulls, and Van der Dussen runs in from the deep to take a good low catch! 8th over: Afghanistan 39-0 (Hazratullah 22, Noor Ali 16) Hendricks continues, and his over starts with a loud appeal for LBW against Hazratullah, but the umpire isn’t interested and neither is Faf du Plessis, the ball surely heading down the leg side. Then one comes off the gloves, but doesn’t carry to the keeper. After three dots and a bit of dangers, Hazratullah clubs one through the covers for four.7th over: Afghanistan 34-0 (Hazratullah 17, Noor Ali 16) Ripper! Rabada’s short ball rears up past Noor Ali’s chin, and then the next is fuller and on a lovely line, getting the batsman pushing again.6th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 16) Hendricks completes his third over at no additional cost.Now it’s actually sunny. The players are back out, and we’ll get back under way very shortly.The break allows me to see Isuru Udana execute two brilliant run-outs in three balls in today’s other game. Follow it here:Apparently this rain is not expected to linger long, so this will be but a brief pause. For now, though, it is raining.5.5 overs: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 16) What seems a pretty light rain starts to fall. Noor Ali hits the first past cover for four, and tickles the fifth fine for another, at which the umpires decide to take the players off.5th over: Afghanistan 25-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 8) Two very close shaves here! Noor Ali goes for a risky second, and gets away with it thanks to an enthusiastic throw back to De Kock, which forces him to collect with his right hand high in the air before throwing down the stumps, giving the batsman time to ground his bat. Then Hazratullah hits the last high over midwicket, and this time two fielders sprint backwards in chase. Morris es, tries to catch but instead shovels it with his fingers further on towards the rope, and the other fails to prevent the four despite a decent e.4th over: Afghanistan 17-0 (Hazratullah 11, Noor Ali 5) “I’m getting it as well,” says David in Tooting of the mysterious Sky voices, as Noor Ali spears the ball through cover for four. “Sounds like it’s the director calling the shots and graphics, but it’s slightly too low to be able to understand. Very frustrating, as I’m sure it would be a refreshing alternative to the actual commentary for a change. A bit of a glimpse behind the curtain...” That is clearly what it is. It sounds extremely full-on.3rd over: Afghanistan 9-0 (Hazratullah 9, Noor Ali 0) Hazratullah gets a couple to backward square leg, and then hoists one over midwicket, safely clear of the field but it gets nowhere near the boundary, pretty much stopping as soon as it lands. 2nd over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Hazratullah 4, Noor Ali 0) Hendricks bowls across Noor Ali Zadran, who looks unhappy about it. He waves his bat at the third, which just passes the edge, and thereafter attempts little but survival. Maiden.1st over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Hazratullah 4, Noor Ali 0) The first ball is a ripper, and nearly saws Hazratullah in half. Rabada can’t keep that up, though - indeed he can’t keep himself up, slipping in the process of sending down his second delivery and calling for some extra sawdust - and after five dots Hazratullah clips a full toss away for four.Anthems done, the opening batsmen head to the middle. Cricket incoming!The teams are out and ready to enjoy their anthems.“Sound yellow! Yellow! Sound!” says the mysterious muffled Sky voice, as an ad break comes to an end.Today’s teams in full:Though I’m also quite impressed by anyone who can hold four or more cricket balls in one hand. I still think the apples are one of the most impressive things about this World Cup.Is anyone else getting funny muffled bonus voices on their Sky coverage? I certainly am, and I’m annoyed about it.There’s plenty of green on the surface, and it’s really quite windy. Kagiso Rabada will be liking what he’s seeing, you’d have thought.“Just the nature of the week. The pitch has been under covers,” says Faf du Plessis. The team is unchanged, so no Ngidi.“There was a bit of space for us to make a mistake here or there before, but now our backs are against the wall,” says Faf du Plessis. That’s about the shape of it. South Africa sit ninth in the 10-team table ahead of this game, against the only side below them, after three defeats and a washout in their first four (Afghanistan have played one game fewer). Any more slip-ups would render their last four fixtures, for them at least, irrelevant.“Week one was a bad start to the tournament but that’s done now,” Du Plessis continued. “We’ve got to put all our energy and focus into the now and what’s coming up next. I truly believe that if we carry those ghosts of the last week with us it’s going to be tough to get out of the hole. But the conversations in the last couple of days, especially with all the rain around, has given me more time to make sure that the guys are on the right path.”It looks like we should get a full day’s play in Cardiff, though some rain is forecast tonight. This could be considered the most important game of the World Cup so far. There should be fireworks. Welcome!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc49d949972e8830a448488c65aa1a6dd5a54af/82_67_2093_1255/master/2093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc863829e297b168ad67022ec1bdb076","title":"sri lanka v australia cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"12th over: Sri Lanka 98-0 (Karunaratne 50, K Perera 46) Target 335 The captain moves to his half-century from 45 balls with his seventh boundary, creaming Richardson through midwicket. Looking to my right, there are quite a few neutral fans in today by the looks and they are ALL on their feet and ALL with Sri Lanka. Great stuff. This is what a World Cup is all about: loud and brilliant.“Don’t know about moving north from the Oval,” writes Peter Rowntree. “Took a squint at the weather forecast for Arundel the other night, because of the Sussex v Gloucestershire game, and unbelievably the weather forecast looks good for about a week. Lovely setting for cricket as well.” Was always going to be so.11th over: Sri Lanka 91-0 (Karunaratne 46, K Perera 43) Target 335 With the field out - four men permitted outside the circle until the end of the 40th - Maxwell is brought straight on by Finch. His overs are very important for Finch now without another all-rounder - he has to do the job. It’s a very good start from him too, sending one down leg but other than that, ripping his accurate off-breaks, keeping them quiet after such a powerful end to the power play. 10th over: Sri Lanka 87-0 (Karunaratne 44, K Perera 42) Target 335 Before the appeal, Perera had the pro Sri Lankan crowd on their feet once more when pulling a ball across the line to the midwicket boundary. Have that! Richardson isn’t quite quick enough to drop short unless it is right at the badge of the helmet. 87 from the power play. The perfect way to take on a big chase. They’re a big shout now.NOT OUT! The technology - ultraedge - shows nothing. Australia lose their review! HAS RICHARDSON FOUND PERERA’S OUTSIDE EDGE? Umpire Dar says no, Finch says yes. The latter sends it upstairs to find out for sure. Stand by. 9th over: Sri Lanka 79-0 (Karunaratne 43, K Perera 35) Target 335 This is getting a bit out of hand for Australia now they need to break this stand up ASAP. 18 from the Behrendorff over! Perera hits a superb shot over cover to begin that goes all the way for SIX! That’s the shorter side of the ground today and the wind is blowing in that direction so that’s clever batting with the field up. Finch gives up the next boundary, taking a ping at Perera’s stumps but with nobody backing up four overthrows help the Sri Lankan cause. To finish, Perera is at it again with a little tuck that beats short fine man for four more! After a great start, Behrendorff is really battling now. One more over in this power play, they have to keep going!8th over: Sri Lanka 61-0 (Karunaratne 42, K Perera 18) Target 335 When talking to Kane Richardson after his World Cup debut on Thursday he wasn’t sure if he would get enough chance, but with Coulter-Nile sore he’s very much an important cog in the Australian machine today. There is a fair bit going on in the over too, which includes another Karunaratne tuck for four - he can’t bowl there with fine leg up. The captain, not known for his lavish strokeplay, is already 42 from 34! 7th over: Sri Lanka 53-0 (Karunaratne 37, K Perera 15) Target 335 I tell you what, Sri Lanka aren’t mucking around here. After taking a look at Behrendorff’s first over and feeling their way through it unsuccessfully, they collect 13 this time to keep the good times rolling. Rotating the strike early in the over, Karunaratne safely hooks a bumper away for four then - in a repeat of the previous set - inside edges the next to the rope as well! He keeps the strike with a clip and the Sri Lankan fans are making a LOT of noise. Don’t forget, this is where they chased down a decent Indian tally in 2017 Champions Trophy - three wickets down.“Settling in for the evening here, Cricket and Crierium du Dauphiné,” emails Damien McLean. “I think Australia has done enough but Sri Lanka would like to make a statement even if they don’t make the semi-finals. Disappointing once again from the middle order after a great start from the top. I’m not the biggest Shaun Marsh fan, even though I know he has seemed at his best in ODI’s of late, but replacing Marcus Stoinis? I don’t think so... Cover for the top order, where you have time to get yourself in, I get that. Not at 6 though. Thoughts? Who could be a better inclusion? Maybe Mitchell Marsh if they take Stoinis out of the squad? Shuffle Warner to 6, Khawaja to open and SMarsh to first drop? I doesn’t seem to be sitting right at the moment anyhow. Thanks for your work.” I don’t think they’ll keep Marsh and Khawaja in the same XI. Today, sure. No big deal. Against England, they won’t run the gauntlet with four quicks plus Maxwell.Oh, and sorry about the score misprint a couple of overs ago. The good thing about the OBO is that I’ve already edited the post, so it never actually happened. 6th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (Karunaratne 25, K Perera 14) Target 335 Pat Cummins has by far the most dot balls in the tournament so far (159 of them before today, Archer in second place about 30 or so behind) but he’s going around a little bit today to begin. Karunaratne does as Perera did from this end a couple of overs ago, pulling a short ball away to the rope with real authority. Shot. A top ball in response from Cummins, jagging back and collecting an inside edge, but it misses the stumps and runs away for four more. Cummins changes up to go around the wicket, Karunaratne keeping the strike with deflecting one to third man. 5th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (Karunaratne 16, K Perera 14) Target 335 Behrendorff starts his World Cup career with an excellent over from the Pavilion End. His left arm pace has been so effective in white-ball cricket for WA over many years, between various injuries. He twice beats the bat of Karunaratne and is also up for a leg before shout when going beyond his inside edge. The maiden is spoiled by Sri Lanka’s skipper from the final ball, clipping one. Still, a lovely set to begin.“Afternoon Adam.” Hello Brian Withington. “The Sri Lankan openers appear determined not to die wondering. In passing, how can this possibly be the last use of the Oval in the tournament - surely some mistake?”I’m afraid this is correct. Just how the tournament was set up, moving from venue to venue after a clump of games. This is the fifth fixture here, it is worth remembering. We move north of the river to Lord’s the week after next.4th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (Karunaratne 15, K Perera 14) Target 335 Cummins is back to his happy place as the artificial light completely takes over. It’s very, very dark. Perera picks out the fielders on the off side a couple of times before getting down the other end via an inside edge. Karunaratne’s turn, who is beaten outside the off stump when missing a cut shot, more convincing to finish with three off the front foot to cover. A tiny bit of rain falls at the end of the over as well. Surely not...3rd over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (Karunaratne 12, K Perera 13) Target 335 Starc reverts to the toes and helmet approach after Karunaratne takes another couple from a length ball, this time to point. The yorker he sends down hits the radar at 90mph, nearly flooring the captain, then cramping him with a short one to finish. Better.2nd over: Sri Lanka 24-0 (Karunaratne 10, K Perera 13) Target 335 This is a superb start! “A statement is being made early,” says Mel Jones on TV and she’s spot on, Karunaratne tucking three to square, Perera smashing four to midwicket then slapping again for four more! Stand and deliver stuff, all off the front foot. 1st over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 7, K Perera 4) Target 335 The skipper is off the mark first up with one to third man, albeit off the outside edge. Starc pulls out of his approach from the next ball before giving Perera enough width to cut a boundary to get his own afternoon underway. It was uppish but there is nobody at point. “I like the tempo of this stroke,” says Kumar Sangakkara on TV. I spoke to the Sri Lankan great on the radio call earlier today and it is fair to say he isn’t a fan of the current domestic set up in his homeland. Back to Starc, who slips a quicker ball past Perera’s inside edge, appealing for lbw, but it is denied with Finch also denying his quick a review. Karunaratne finishes with four of his own, timing a wonderfully timed punch off the back foot to the point rope. Excellent start. The players are on the field. Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera are opening for the Sri Lankans, Mitch Starc starting Australia off from the pavilion end. PLAY! Afternoon. Thanks, JP. 33 in the final five overs wasn’t quite what Australia were hoping for after Finch, Smith and Maxwell toyed with the Sri Lankans for the ten overs prior, but they still will be satisfied with 3347 having bee sent in at the toss. Some magnificent death bowling prevented a final surge, Udana especially classy. If Australia can defend this, it will move them to outright first on the table as we near the middle of the group stage. For Sri Lanka’s part, chasing 335 down will move then into equal second (on points, not net run rate), would you believe.Looking forward to your company throughout the afternoon. I’m coning to you from the front row of the outside press tributes in the OSC Stand. The Cricketeer Volunteers have just been paraded across the field with this being the final match at The Oval for the tournament. Too soon, I say. Let’s talk throughout the chase. That was a peculiar old innings from Australia wasn’t it? Finch and Warner looked in superb touch to begin with - the skipper in particular with his elegant drives within the V - before the introduction of de Silva slowed their momentum. Like a cyclist running out of puff riding uphill Australia just seemed unable to do anything to jolt themselves out of their growing slumber, one that accounted for the uncharacteristically somnolent Warner (26) and Khawaja (10). The introduction of Smith at the halfway mark with his side 100-2 proved the decisive moment of the innings. His energy at the crease rebooted Finch and together the pair plundered 173 in 20 overs to take the game away from Sri Lanka. Finch eventually perished for a magnificent 153 with his runs accumulated all round the wicket with all manner of craft and strength. If he has ever played better than today it must have been a fine innings to watch. Smith fell shortly afterwards for 73, the second of five dismissals in the closing eight overs as the wheels fell off somewhat for Australia.Glenn Maxwell survived the carnage to smash 46 from 25 balls but around him there was an absence of targeted slogging with Shaun Marsh’s three from nine likely to draw plenty of ire.Sri Lanka deserve great credit for how they bowled late on. Udana and Malinga in particular executed their slower balls and yorkers to perfection and Udana’s fielding off his own bowling to effect two run outs in an over was memorable.334 should be plenty for Australia with their attack but it is short of what they should have achieved after such a strong start and then that massive Finch-Smith partnership. The questions that were asked of Australia’s batting before this innings remain and there is work to do before the semi-finals.Find out if Sri Lanka can get themselves over the line and remain a going concern in this World Cup shortly with Adam Collins at the keys.I’ll catch you again soon. Thanks for all your superb contributions.50th over: Australia 334-7 (Maxwell 46, Starc 5) Perera to bowl the final over of the innings and it begins brilliantly with four singles and a two before Maxwell manipulates a boundary through midwicket from the final delivery. Weirdly, Sri Lanka will probably head to the interval the more upbeat of the two sides following that performance in the death overs. Still, Australia have more than enough runs to assure themselves of a semi-final berth. 49th over: Australia 324-7 (Maxwell 40, Starc 1) Superb death overs bowling from Udana and backed up by his own superb fielding. Not the conclusion to Australia’s innings that they were looking for. Bad to worse for Australia. Another Udana yorker collected in his follow through but this time he throws down the striker’s stumps and Cummins is out for a golden duck. The ball between that and the previous run out almost bagged a wicket too but the thick edge that spiraled off Maxwell’s bat just cleared Angelo Mathews in the gully. Australia’s late-innings collapse continues apace. Carey is the latest to go, run out brilliantly by Udana, the bowler gathering a superb yorker in his follow through, spinning and, on his knees, throwing down the non-striker’s stumps.48th over: Australia 317-5 (Maxwell 34, Carey 4) Another excellent death over by Malinga, seven from it, and it would have been tighter than that but for some questionable Sri Lankan fielding.Australia are going to post a total that is likely matchwinning, but again they have failed to address glaring issues with their batting.  Terrific over by Udana, like Malinga before him landing a host of slower balls and yorkers to deny Australia any boundaries then jagging the wicket of a frustrated Marsh at the end of it, holding out to midwicket after labouring to just three runs from nine balls.Meanwhile, in other cricket news...46th over: Australia 306-4 (Maxwell 29, Marsh 2) After the carnage of the previous over Sri Lanka will be overjoyed at Malinga’s ability to concede just three singles and a leg-bye in a set full of yorkers and change-ups. 45th over: Australia 302-4 (Maxwell 27, Marsh 1) Oi oi! It’s Maxy magic time! 22 from Pradeep’s over. He begins short so Maxwell slaps it like a forehand smash wide of long on. The second is length and goes the journey over the bowler’s head. The third is dug out for a dot but the fourth is whipped with immense bottom hand force for four through midwicket. Ball five is a full toss carted through cow corner and salt is rubbed into the wound with a top edged pull over the keeper four more. 44th over: Australia 280-4 (Maxwell 5, Marsh 1) Well, that was unexpected. A wicket and just five runs from that Malinga over. Australia’s inability to put together a full 50 over innings is again coming back to haunt them. Bosh! Vintage Malinga. Perfectly executed yorker from around the wicket to Smith and even the very best struggle to play them. Two quick wickets to Sri Lanka and that may buy them some hope at the innings break. Excellent knock from Smith. Not only his 73 runs but his ability to play as Finch’s foil and add some impetus to the innings following the lacklustre displays of Warner and Khawaja.43rd over: Australia 275-3 (Smith 73, Maxwell 1) Well played skipper. A massive inidual knock and with the good grace to allow us a few overs of Glenn Maxwell before the close. The fielding has been pretty ordinary. The bowling hasn’t been that bad (in my opinion) especially during that middle phase led by de Silva. Like most sides in the modern era they lack an ability to force a breakthrough when a batting side takes control. No double century for Finch. He fails to pick an Udana slower ball and his mighty heave skews off the top edge and into the hands of Karunaratne at cover. Superb innings nonetheless featuring some exquisite timing, brutal hitting, and no shortage of patience as well. Top stuff.42nd over: Australia 269-2 (Finch 152, Smith 69) Can Malinga stem the bleeding? No. Finch stands and delivers, muscling the ball through midwicket for four then Smith scythes a mighty blow across the line, sending the ball miles over cow corner accompanied by the sweetest “clack” you could wish to hear. That was pure ball striking. 41st over: Australia 255-2 (Finch 137, Smith 62) Smith may be the most awkward batsman in the world to bowl to once set. He ends up in such unfamiliar positions at the crease which allows him to work the ball to indefensible areas. Pradeep does nothing wrong at the start of his ninth over but a leg stump yorker ends up beating square-leg for four then length on off stump disappears to the third-man boundary. A single brings Finch on strike and with it creativity replaced by brute force. Poor Pradeep has nowhere to go as Finch wallops him over cover for a one bounce four then pulls him disdainfully for four more. 40th over: Australia 237-2 (Finch 137, Smith 53) Here we go! Finch has been winding up for a few overs now and he enters tee-off beast mode with a mighty heave across the line, depositing Perera into the stand behind square leg. He follows that up with a powerful cut for four.39th over: Australia 224-2 (Finch 126, Smith 51) Pradeep’s back for another dart but he’s powerless to stop the insatiable Steve Smith from reaching his eighth 50 in ten World Cup matches. He might have been out of international cricket for a year but he hasn’t missed a beat on his return. Impossible to bowl to and his intent has revitalised Australia’s innings. 38th over: Australia 218-2 (Finch 122, Smith 49) This partnership is operating effectively at the moment. Smith is happy to rotate the strike and Finch is happy to smite boundaries, the latest a sledgehammer of a square drive. Remember when I asked if he could make 200+? In response to Stephen Barnes (35th over) the mysterious Yum has an answer. “The former is the most heinous possible for the bowling side which is obvious if a wicket falls. Further logic would say that a front foot no ball would rate fairly highly on the heinousness scale because it is in fact cheating, in the sense of being able to get the ball to the batter an inch faster.” And so does Geoff Wignall: “I guess the logic is that if the batsman knew at the time of delivery that a ball would be called wide he or she would leave it alone and avoid any risk of being caught, whereas with early warning of a no-ball they’d throw everything at it without risk of dismissal.”37th over: Australia 210-2 (Finch 116, Smith 47) It’s getting a little gloomy at the Oval. The lights are on and the wind’s up. I wonder if we’re in for a shower at some point? Udana enjoys the change in conditions, sending down a ball that makes the rare journey past the outside edge of Smith’s bat but he can’t complete the set to Finch, his final delivery ending up at the extra cover fence after the Aussie skipper was allowed enough room to free his arms.

But it turned out to be a big hit, with a record run in the West End and then Broadway before being turned into a film four years later starring Rex Harrison.Now the director of a new version of the film and one of its lead actors, Dame Judi Dench, feel that the “dark space” we are currently in provides another fittingly gloomy backdrop for the release of a production that they hope will lift people’s spirits.The Oscar-winning actress plays the eccentric mystic, Madame Arcati, who inadvertently conjures up the ghost of a jealous first wife, who is unaware that she is dead when she returns to haunt her scoundrel husband and his new partner.“When the play opened in the West End in 1941, its subject-matter was, on some levels, quite dark because it was about ghosts, death and losing people,” said Edward Hall, the director of the latest incarnation of Blithe Spirit, which begins filming this week. “But actually Coward wrote this wonderful comedy and it struck a vein. I feel that the time is right to tell that story again to a broad audience because we’re in quite a dark space at the moment.”Dench is one of Britain’s foremost actresses, whose roles have ranged from monarchs to M in the Bond films. Hall said: “She loves the story, the character and Coward. Like us, she feels it is a great moment to cheer people up. I said to her, ‘when you come out of the cinema, you should feel like you’ve drunk a glass of cold champagne a little too quickly’.” The film marks Hall’s directorial debut in films. He has just stepped down as artistic director of the Hampstead theatre, London,where stage hits include Sunny Afternoon, the Kinks musical that transferred to Broadway, winning Olivier awards. His television productions have included William Boyd’s Restless.Working with Dench is “extra special”, he said. His late father, the director Sir Peter Hall, cast Dench in landmark productions such as Antony and Cleopatra and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, as well as another Coward classic, Hay Fever.Blithe Spirit, set in 1937, is one of Coward’s most-loved plays. Hollywood studios competed to adapt it but Coward took the project instead to his friend David Lean. The new film will be released next year, marking the 75th anniversary of the original, which starred Margaret Rutherford alongside Rex Harrison.The shoot will take place at various UK locations, including a private art deco house and Cliveden, the National Trust’s Buckinghamshire estate. Dench’s character, Madame Arcati, is described by Coward as “a striking woman, dressed not too extravagantly but with a decided bias towards the barbaric”. Hall said: “I always felt there was only one person in the world who could ever play her and that was Judi. Fortunately, she felt the same.”Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens, who appeared with Dench in Hay Fever, is cast as bestselling crime novelist Charles who suffers from terrible writer’s block in struggling with his first screenplay. His picture-perfect new wife Ruth dreams of leaving London for Hollywood. Seeking inspiration, he invites Madame Arcati to perform a séance in his home, only to realise that she has inadvertently summoned the spirit of his deceased first wife – the fiery Elvira, who tries to win back his affections, leading to an increasingly complex love triangle.The writer-producers, Nick Moorcroft and Meg Leonard, have adapted Blithe Spirit with Piers Ashworth. Moorcroft said: “It is one of Coward’s most famous comedies and, right now, everybody needs a reason to laugh.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours. Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94508f6fa7118cd92daf42000adcfa07fcf1701/0_165_4494_2698/master/4494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ff9303cb20d5d7eecaccace62fb6b1","title":"car free coast lake district cumbria beaches walking","story":"Of the millions who visit the Lake District every year, very few check out its dramatic coastline, so our writer has its beaches and wild dunes almost to herselfThe air smells of seaweed and woodsmoke as I step on to the platform at Ravenglass.

But, like most of the other 16 million visitors a year, I’ve rarely visited the Cumbrian coast.I’d arrived in Lancaster 150 minutes after leaving London – less than half what it would take me to drive – and switched to the railway that meanders past Barrow-in-Furness and through the national park. The kaleidoscope of landscape and changeable weather outside was engrossing: green crags rose out of foggy marshland, ribbed sand shone gold and Black Combe loomed through storm clouds over Silecroft. There were manmade landmarks too, such as the lighthouse-shaped monument above Ulverston or the red sandstone walls of Furness Abbey.It’s part of a huge Unesco world heritage site that includes Hadrian’s Wall: Frontiers of the Roman Empire. In 2017, Unesco added the Lake District to its list, so Ravenglass is one of very few places to have double world heritage status.After grilled Manx kipper the next morning, I take the train five minutes to Drigg station request stop, to explore a huge area of sand dunes on the edge of the national park. Walking to the sea, I pass the fence of a low-level radioactive waste facility – a reminder that Sellafield, the elephant on the coast, is just five miles north. Site of the world’s first commercial nuclear power station and now a decommissioning plant, its chimneys are intermittently visible. Local wildlife seems to be thriving though there are orange-breasted stonechats on the fences and sand martins looping overhead.The thousand acres of dunes near Drigg are full of flowers and birdsong. The white burnet roses have a particular unearthly beauty – like the simbelmynë flowers that grow on the grassy tombs of Rohan in Lord of the Rings. I follow a sandy path through the marram grass and walk along the beach to Seascale beside a calm, cloud-echoing sea. Birds are the only other creatures I see for three miles along holiday-brochure sands on a sunny summer half-term morning.Waiting for a train back from Seascale, I can see the Isle of Man – a ghostly shape across the sun-hazed sea. “Ah, Mona’s isle, the vanishing isle,” says one of my fellow passengers before lapsing back into telling me how terrible the trains are. (The introduction of last summer’s timetable caused cancellations, although it did also mean new Sunday trains.)You can’t stay in Ravenglass and not ride on La’al Ratty, as the local narrow-gauge steam railway is nicknamed. Sitting in miniature open-air carriages, as sooty vapour drifts through the oak leaves overhead, we pass through scenery that feels more CGI than real. Twisted trunks writhe out of the mossy woods and the slopes of Muncaster Fell are cloaked in violet rhododendrons.At the end of the little railway is the village of Boot, at the foot of England’s highest mountain, Scafell Pike. From Boot, you can hike over tarn-topped moorland or stride through misty woods. I opt for an hour’s amble to the Dalegarth Falls, a series of ferny, fairytale cascades, and a 10-minute stroll down country lanes near the station, past two pubs, to pretty Eskdale Mill. The mill, reopening this month after ambitious renovations, is part of the area’s varied history. “We’ve got everything here, from Neolithic to nuclear,” says Les Coan, an enthusiastic volunteer.The sense of stepping into a film-scape increases with an afternoon visit to Muncaster Castle (adult £15, child £7.50), a pleasant mile from Ravenglass, where the annual Festival of Fools has just finished. I climb through sunlit forest into unfeasibly flowery gardens with views over the estuary to the Irish Sea. Tunnels of cream and crimson blossom lead to the castle, rich in art, carved wood, tapestries and gossipy family anecdotes.A Muncaster ticket includes the on-site Hawk and Owl centre’s displays the birds sweep and plunge above a wildflower meadow at speeds of up to 70mph. Senior falconer Emma McLachlan seems to dance with a huge falcon, in a choreographed pattern of glides and es with a stirring musical soundtrack. She describes the bird to us as “like a real-life dragon”.At teatime, tall grey herons start to gather in the trees. Peter Frost-Pennington is director of Muncaster Castle, which is his wife’s ancestral home. Over coffee and lemon drizzle cake, he enthuses about the area’s wildlife. Almost every type of English habitat is represented within an eight-mile radius so “everything from a beetle to an eagle can live here”, he tells me “it’s the Lake District on steroids.”I head home on the coastal railway next day, via Carlisle this time. The dunes have vanished into veiling rain so I decide to stop off at two museums in Whitehaven, a post-industrial town with Georgian architecture, half an hour north of Ravenglass. The Rum Story (adult £9.95, child £4.95), winding through a series of original cellars and warehouses, explores both grim and cheerful aspects of the “dark spirit of Whitehaven”. Besides a harrowing slave ship diorama, there are squawking rainforests, Chicago jazz, and the ticket comes with a free tipple.The waterside Beacon Museum (adult £6.50, child £3.25) has a floor dedicated to Sellafield and another tracing the area’s past through Vikings and Victorian trading ships. History is inseparable from the ocean on this stretch of coast and, from the Beacon’s top-floor gallery, there’s a view across harbour walls and lighthouse to a wild, wind-whitened sea.• Transport was provided by Virgin Trains (London-Carlisle from £26 one-way, Northern (Cumbria Coast day ranger from £20.90), and the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway (adult day ticket from £9).

The only clue that this isn’t just any woodland trail is the height of those trees: the oaks and beeches are young, barely three metres tall.That’s because we’re riding on what, until 1989, was the “death strip” – the zone between Berlin’s inner and outer walls, filled with tripwire machine guns, trenches and dogs, and guarded by soldiers in watchtowers. This November sees the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and I’m riding stretches of the Berliner Mauerweg – the 160km trail tracing its path – to see how the city has rearranged itself in three decades.“The wall wasn’t a wall here, but a high fence.” Rainer Block, a local SPD councillor, is showing us around his patch in the south of the city. Grossziethen is as tidy and prosperous-looking a German suburb as you could imagine, which makes its history more jarring. As we ride, Rainer points out streets close to the border where only the party faithful were allowed to live, stepladders had to be locked away, and overnight guests had to be reported. A memorial tells of Horst Kullack, a 23-year-old with learning difficulties who, after a few drinks on New Year’s Eve 1971, wanted to visit his beloved grandmother in West Berlin, and was fatally shot by the guards.Here Berlin comes to an abrupt stop – fields of wheat and barley on one side and the apartment blocks of the Bauhaus Gropiusstadt on the other. Today the area is a weekend destination for cyclists and walkers, who queue excitedly outside the Moin Moin ice-cream parlour in Grossziethen (try the vivid green Waldmeister – woodruff – flavour).It’s salutary to remember that the wall was a feature of the city for less time (just over 28 years) than has now passed since it fell. Signs of the ision are being erased, and not only by nature. We see neat new family houses on stretches of the death strip – it was a boon for urban planners, says Rainer. But in some ways, the wall is still there: he points out the well-kept front garden of one of his neighbours, enclosed by a few metres of unremarkable metal mesh. “The authorities bulldozed the fence,” says Rainer, “but left the debris. This chap just recycled the materials.”Two hours’ ride west is Potsdam, with its palaces, period houses and the Glienicke bridge, which actually looks a lot less bleak than in the 2015 film Bridge of Spies. By the Jungfernsee, we bag a lakeside table at the Meierei brewery and get stuck into huge Maß (litre) glasses of beer.Also enjoying a beer are Rafael, a twentysomething Berliner, and his Brazilian girlfriend Luisa: both are both passionate about their united and outward-looking city. “There are no boundaries,” says Rafael, a microbiologist. “Friends from the former GDR might use slightly different words, but no one thinks anything of it.” Luisa, who works here for a football app, says she wouldn’t swap Berlin for anywhere. “It’s so open and welcoming – you’re as likely to hear Spanish or Portuguese in a bar as German, and many workplaces operate in English.”Rafael loves the way once forbidden or dangerous places, marked by suffering and death, have become the city’s happening areas, known for dancing and fun.We’d seen this the day before near our Airbnb flat in newly named Kreuzkölln, a lively district between trendy Kreuzburg and multicultural Neukölln, where cool organic cafes rub shoulders with cheap Syrian and Sudanese restaurants. The wall ran down its eastern edge, which made this an unpopular dead-end area before reunification, and one ripe for hipster colonisation afterwards.After 1989, many East Berliners wanted the “wall of shame” torn down and forgotten it was West Berliners mainly who fought to keep parts of it standing and its route marked – by a double row of cobbles. We follow these towards Treptow Park, with its massive, very Soviet-looking memorial to USSR soldiers who died in 1945’s Battle of Berlin, and note with amusement that, at one point, the marker cobbles disappear beneath the concrete car park of a large Aldi.Less-visited than the East Side is an informal open-air gallery in the northern, arty district of Prenzlauer Berg. At a remnant of the inner wall in the Mauerpark, we chat to street artists from Vietnam and Prague, as well as Germany, as they wield their spray cans.The Mauerweg leads from here past a poignant memorial at Bernauer Strasse, with photographs, chapel and museum, then west along residential streets. Like many cities, Berlin is growing fast, and by the Spandau ship canal the preserved Kieler Eck watchtower – where 24-year-old Günter Liftin was the first fugitive shot and killed, in 1961 – now gazes over new high-end waterside apartments.The Berlin Wall RaceA 161km run around the wall route, in an anti-clockwise direction, starting in Prenzlauer Berg. The race is sold out for runners but spectating will be great fun.• 17-18 August, 100meilen.deOderberger Straße walkUntil 1989, this was a dead-end street ending at the wall. This free walk tells tales of life on the street in the 1970s and 80s, finishing at the site of a viewing platform on the west side.• Selected Fridays and Sundays 21 June to 9 November, register at berlin@hdg.deFree music festivalThe highlight of a week’s celebration in November will be a free music festival on 9 November, with stages along the wall route featuring artists connected with the events of 198990, or who stand for a fresh start.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She didn’t bother disguising her disdain for reporters. She didn’t bother holding press briefings – the last one was over 90 days ago. And she didn’t bother with the truth. She was an incompetent press secretary.Here’s the thing though: Sanders was never really hired to be a press secretary. Her real job, I’d venture, was to be a Very Visible Woman. Her real job was to be the female face of a deeply misogynistic administration to play the role of the empowered working mother and make the Trump administration’s crass patriarchy more palatable.For a while Sanders was extremely effective at weaponizing her womanhood. When politically convenient, for example, she’d bring up the fact that she was the first mother to have the role of press secretary. “That says less about me than it does about this president,” Sanders told reporters in 2017. She then went on to disingenuously claim that “empowering working moms is the heart of the president’s agenda, particularly when it comes to things like tax reform”.There’s no better example of how effective Sanders was at using her sex as a shield than the speed with which a number of high-profile female journalists jumped to Sanders’ defense when Michelle Wolf made a joke about the press secretary at the 2018 White House correspondents’ dinner.“Watching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable,” MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski tweeted at the time. (Wolf didn’t make a joke about Sanders’ looks this was a willful misinterpretation.) The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman similarly announced that it was admirable Sanders “sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television”.Sanders is far from the only woman to have played an important role in the Trump administration. While Trump may not have a feminist bone in his body, he’s elevated a number of women into high-profile positions – a talking point frequently repeated by his acolytes. Women like Kellyanne Conway, Nikki Haley, Kirstjen Nielsen and (of course) Ivanka Trump, have been some of the most prominent faces of his administration. These footsoldiers of the patriarchy have helped to roll back women’s rights and reinforce inequality while allowing the Trump administration to boast about “empowering women”. You could call it white(woman)washing.It’s not clear who is going to replace Sanders yet. (And, let’s face it, in many ways she is irreplaceable.) However, my bet is that Trump is strategically going to pick another woman. Indeed rumours are currently swirling that Stephanie Grisham, Melania’s spokeswoman, is one of the leading candidates for the job. Whoever it is, good luck to them. Sanders has set a high bar for odiousness hers will be a tough act to follow.My Little Pony, a children’s cartoon featuring little ponies, is marking Pride month with its first lesbian horse couple. They are called Aunt Holiday and Auntie Lofty, and they take care of a little pony called Scootaloo. Conservatives, predictably, are screaming “nay” and freaking out.Artist Andrea Bowers has got an installation at Art Basel, Open Secrets, that looks at all the sexual allegations that have come out during the #MeToo movement – it’s priced at $300,000. The ethics of profiting from #MeToo are already questionable but there’s more: Bowers used an abuse survivor’s photo without their consent. After much justified outcry this week, the photo has now been removed.A bunch of Silicon Valley executives went to Italy to meet a designer who makes $1,000 sweatpants. While on their sweatpant sojourn, they took a group photo. A very normal thing to do! They then realized that a photo featuring 15 dudes was maybe not the best optics and photoshopped two women into it, before the picture was published in GQ. A very normal thing to do!’s got a good piece on how Argentina’s team, which was so underfunded it didn’t play in 2015 or 2017, took on sexism to reach this year’s World Cup. Meanwhile, Trump refused to say whether he thought the US women’s team deserves equal pay. Megan Rapinoe won’t sing the national anthem (good for her). And Marina Hyde has a fun piece on “the great under-reported story of this Women’s World Cup: men”.The internet is obsessed with Reeves: the guy is everywhere at the moment. His hands, however, are not. Reeves, who has been dubbed a “respectful king” has mastered the art of the ‘hover hand’ when taking photos with women. Joe Biden: take note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6abd2dbee10dc590c10b4bef37748f42de57e6bd/0_118_3715_2229/master/3715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cdd061241d72832da6666a614c8c98c","title":"spanish parties far right vox madrid","story":"New mayor shrugs off criticism, saying nothing illegal about decision to work with VoxMadrid’s city council has swung sharply to the right after the conservative People’s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party enlisted the controversial support of the far-right Vox to take control of the Spanish capital.On Saturday morning, the PP’s José Luis Martínez-Almeida was sworn in as mayor, with Citizens’ Begoña Villacís as his deputy.Martínez-Almeida succeeds Manuela Carmena, a leftwing former judge whose four-year stint as mayor was marked by a commitment to ersity and the environment.Martínez-Almeida shrugged off criticism of his party’s decision to work with Vox, challenging anyone “to find anything that lies outside the legal order” in his deals.But he also promised to serve all the people of Madrid.“Between us, we will build Madrid,” he said. “We won’t leave behind those who want a more open Madrid. We want to write the future and not remember the past.”Carmena congratulated her successor and reminded him of the importance of both feminism and democracy.“We need to look after democracy because we know what it cost to bring democracy to this country,” she said. “It took so much, such an effort and so many lives that we cannot forget it.”The PP has signalled that one of its first acts in office will be rethinking and possibly scrapping Carmena’s urban low emissions zone, known as Madrid Central.Both the PP and Citizens have shifted further to the right over recent months in the hope of stopping their voters drifting towards Vox, whose tough line on Catalan independence, anti-immigration stance and tirades against feminism have attracted many traditional PP supporters.Citizens was subjected to fierce criticism last December after it cut a similar deal with Vox to govern the southern region of Andalucía.Earlier this week, the French government explicitly warned Citizens – which is part of the new liberal group in the European parliament led by Emmanuel Macron – that any further cosying up to the far right would have consequences.On Friday, France’s secretary of state for European affairs, Amélie de Montchalin, expressed “grave concerns” over such deals, adding: “We think that an alliance with the far right, like we have seen in Spain, is not an option.”France’s intervention led Vox to urge Spain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to “defend Spaniards’ independence” in the face of “unacceptable” interference.The former French prime minister Manuel Valls, who staged an unsuccessful bid to become the mayor of Barcelona in last month’s election, has also repeatedly warned his Citizens allies not to collaborate with Vox and called for a cordon sanitaire against the far right.Valls, who campaigned on a staunchly unionist platform, has thrown his weight behind Ada Colau, the leftwing mayor of Barcelona, who is on course for a second term in the Catalan capital.Although the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party won marginally more votes than Colau’s group, Colau looks set to retain office after reaching an agreement with the Catalan branch of the socialist party and Valls’ councillors.The focus will now be on Sánchez’s efforts to form a national government.Although his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party finished first in the general election at the end of April, it fell well short of a majority in the congress of deputies.Sánchez has agreed to cooperate with the anti-austerity Podemos party to work towards building a government, but has ruled out a coalition deal. He has also raised the possibility of holding another general election if his efforts to resume office are thwarted in parliament.Another vote – which would be Spain’s fourth in under four years – would favour the socialists as it would hurt Podemos and see the three rightwing parties in renewed competition for votes.

In November, Guatemalans overtook Mexicans as the largest group detained at the US border, and the regions where most migrants set out from are overwhelmingly indigenous.Cabrera pledges to tackle the inequalities of Guatemalan society with a sweeping constitutional reform to ensure fair representation for the country’s indigenous, Afro-Guatemalan and mestizo peoples.Other priorities include stopping illegal land-grabs, ending immunity for elected officials, nationalisation of electricity, and legal scrutiny of mining, dam and agricultural licences sanctioned without consultation.“I didn’t ask for this role or buy it – I was elected for this mission by the people, and I’m daring to break the silence as a Mam woman,” Cabrera told the Observer.Cabrera, who speaks Spanish as a second language, grew up in El Asintal, an impoverished community on the west coast, where she worked on coffee fincas with her parents and siblings, and was married at 15.“I came from nothing – from under the rubbish. But for many years I’ve worked with communities suffering lack of opportunities, undignified wages, migration and violence as a result of structural problems and corruption,” she said.She was selected by grassroots members of Codeca, the country’s largest campesino organisation to represent its newly formed political party the Movement for the Liberation of Peoples (MLP).Cabrera’s political hopes were given a major boost by a recent online campaign organised by volunteer communication experts who designed the slogan Yo Elijo Dignidad (I choose dignity).As the buzz around Cabrera got louder, the criticism got uglier. She’s been derided as uneducated and uncouth, and condemned as a radical communist who wants to turn Guatemala into the next Venezuela – an accusation she denies.“She’s given a face and voice to the excluded majority with a radical political project to disrupt and transform the oppressive state. She’s unlike anything we’ve seen since the 1940s,” said Andrea Ixchiu, a member of her communications team. “This candidacy is historic.”The election race has been marred by repeated accusations of corruption as a UN-backed commission against impunity (Cicig) prepares to leave the country after President Jimmy Morales unilaterally declared an end of its mandate.The current frontrunner is Sandra Torres, a former first lady accused of money laundering and illicit campaign financing. In second place is Alejandro Giammattei who was director of prisons while a clandestine death squad carried out extrajudicial killings of detainees.In third place is the businessman Roberto Arzú, who faces sanctions in Miami for failing to comply with a court order to pay off multimillion-dollar debts to his political strategist.The odds are stacked against Cabrera, who closed her campaign last Saturday by thanking in Mam her supporters who had travelled overnight from remote villages with homemade signs.But for many at the event, the hopeful atmosphere was reminiscent of the 2015 anti-corruption protests that eventually led to the resignation, arrest and imprisonment of the then president, Otto Pérez Molina.“It’s time the state stopped being racist – and for that we need structural reforms,” said Linda Rabanales, 24, an anthropology student. “That’s why I’m voting for Thelma.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach says he is heeding warning from Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in advance of October\u0026rsquos budgetFrom Alcock and Brown\u0026rsquos transatlantic crossing to global commercial flights, the 20th century saw astonishing developments in aviationEvent marks famous 1919 flight of Alcock and Brown from Canada to ConnemaraInsurers warned \u0026lsquoIreland isn\u0026rsquot Treasure Island\u0026rsquo, says Leo Varadkar as he promises government will tackle price of coverAdrian Murphy (43) was originally from Co Kilkenny but had been living in LondonPlane being used for training flight appears to have broken in two on impact in a fieldPaschal Donohoe may table a budget in which spending is significantly curtailedDistiller makes statement on Facebook after rugby club\u0026rsquos signing of Irish ex-internationalPublication of report on implementing the Sl\u0026aacuteintecare plan has been shelved until autumnEuropediatrics 2019 in Dublin discusses the causes and prevention of childhood obesityMason Hayes \u0026amp Curran brought in to assess legal liability over abuse casesHouses of the Oireachtas Commission has invested heavily in fitness for its members and staff since private gym opened in 2005Affected property owners expected to receive average compensation payment of \u0026euro25,000Mary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor says proposals are \u0026lsquonot worth sacrificing a community for\u0026rsquoLatest figures show six criminal investigations into false claims opened every monthOPW chairman stresses increases not comparable to children\u0026rsquos hospital overrunsNew HSE boss, who is seen as accountable, tough and innovative, faces a daunting taskIFPO seeking legal advice on overturning agreement between Ireland and UK"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3920718.1560167775!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"charting the take off of air travel","story":"Commemorations have been held in Co Galway to mark the centenary of John Alcock and Arthur Brown’s famous transatlantic flight from Newfoundland to Connemara.

Shortly afterwards, two gentlemen surprised the signal operator at Marconi Station (also in Clifden) when they landed that plane next to the station and announced that they had just arrived from Newfoundland.The two gentlemen turned out to be Captain John (‘Jack’) Alcock and his navigator Arthur (‘Teddie’) Brown who had won the race to be first to cross the Atlantic Ocean flying a “heavier than air” machine. After getting an autograph, the operator complied with the aviators’ requests for a bath and a shave and by noon the news of the flight had attracted hundreds of locals to the scene. By the next day, newspaper columns had filled with “the thrilling story” of a “terrible flight” that had bridged the Atlantic in just over 16 hours.The period between the wars was an age of many first flights, as war-trained aviators sought new outlets for their skills. One of the earliest commercial flights arrived in Dublin about 10 days after Alcock and Brown’s flight. Mr Harry Gordon Selfridge travelled to visit Brown Thomas and Co, which his company (Selfridges) had recently purchased. Selfridge enthused about his 3½ hour time-saving flight to Dublin and predicted that soon “it should not be a difficult thing to live in Dublin and do business in London if one wanted to”.Selfridge imagined commercial transatlantic flights becoming a possibility within three or four years. As for Alcock, he had blithely predicted commercial transatlantic flights within 12 months involving “a big flying machine”.“I think that there is something in it,” he remarked. There was indeed “something in it” though it took much longer to come to pass than either Selfridge or Alcock thought.In the early 20th century, there was almost no air travel industry. The development of airplanes and aero engines was closely linked to the development of automobiles and the Great War.Born in 1892, Alcock had come to flying through training as a mechanic. He became involved in the repair of aero engines in 1911 and learned to fly at age 20. His first ‘job’ as a pilot was for an automobile company for whom he flew races, including a 1914 flight between London and Manchester. During the war, he trained pilots in England before being deployed to the Mediterranean. There, he was captured by the Turks after engine failure forced him to ditch his plane into the sea. He was released in 1918 and soon had teamed up with the Vickers company to enter the transatlantic flight competition sponsored by the Daily Mail.Brown soon joined the team as navigator. Brown had trained as an electrical engineer but he had also been involved in flight during the war and had obtained his pilot’s licence afterwards. He too had been a prisoner of war, shot down over France in 1915 and captured by the Germans. He later worked at producing aircraft for the war effort.The Vickers Vimy aircraft that Alcock and Brown flew had been designed as a bomber. It was powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines. Rolls-Royce had been designing aero engines throughout the war and had also supplied engines for a further, unsuccessful, transatlantic crossing. (This flight had left a few weeks before Alcock and Brown. The aviators were rescued by a ship about 500 miles before Ireland when they were forced to ditch into the sea.)Aero engines at the time were variations on an internal combustion engine (the system used to power automobiles) and were designed for short flights reflecting their use as bombers during the war. A Rolls-Royce engineer (Eric Platford) and a mechanic (Bob Lyons) travelled to Newfoundland with the aviators and modified the engine in order to suit the longer distance required. The plane had to carry extra fuel to enable the long flying time. The constant damp and cold conditions of the flight had to be accounted for in terms of choice of engine oil.Rolls-Royce aero engines had developed a reputation for reliability during the war, essential for a nonstop flight with no place to land. The Eagle was also very powerful for the time, allowing the plane to travel at a maximum speed of about 120 miles per hour (a modern airplane cruises at about four times that speed).The choice of a dual-engine aircraft did not reduce the risks associated with a long flight as the plane could not fly with a single engine. The transatlantic flight presented a huge number of technological challenges aside from engine reliability. According to Peter Collins, director of the Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust, early aviators were essentially using navigation tools adapted from ships. It was much easier to navigate in daylight over land than in the dark over sea. The Atlantic also presented challenging weather conditions for plane and passengers.Alcock and Brown had prepared for the cold with electrically-heated suits, but they had to remove ice from parts of the plane and engines and all of their communications equipment was quickly rendered useless after take-off. Landing was dangerous and their sudden landing in the bog (which they had not been able to recognise as bog from the sky) might have been a disastrous end to a daring feat. Alcock died later that same year from injuries he received in a bad landing outside of Paris.Imagined future of commercial flightAlcock and Brown’s flight occurred against a backdrop of other significant achievements in aviation during the inter-war years. The first flight to Australia from England occurred in 1919, the first circumnavigation of the globe using flight occurred in 1922. By 1927, Lufthansa had even hired the first female pilot.The developments in aviation over the 20th century must have been astonishing for ordinary citizens. As Collins suggested to me, a person born in 1900 was born into a world with no “heavier than air” flying machines but by the time they reached adulthood people were flying across the largest oceans. By the time they reached retirement age, they might have been able to afford a flight on a commercial airliner, powered by the new jet engines.The competitive, dare-devil atmosphere of early aviation has perhaps now moved to the realm of space travel. When we think of flying we think primarily of safety and increasingly of sustainability. The next frontier in flying is not a continent or an ocean but a fast, fully-electrical engine. In 2020, Rolls-Royce is hoping to demonstrate the world’s fastest electrical plane. Perhaps by the end of our lifetimes we’ll be crossing the Atlantic in one.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at DCU"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3927173.1560590999!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia sought to use social media to influence eu vote report finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean authorities blamed Russian groups on Friday for disinformation campaigns designed to depress turnout and sway public opinion in last month’s European Union elections. File Photograph: Vincent KesslerReuters European authorities blamed Russian groups on Friday for disinformation campaigns designed to depress turnout and sway public opinion in last month’s European Union elections.The preliminary review by the European Commission and the bloc’s foreign policy and security arm found that Russian-linked groups and other nonstate actors had worked to undermine credibility in the European Union through Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Officials said new regulations might be needed to force internet platforms to do more to stop the spread of deliberately false information.“The evidence collected revealed a continued and sustained disinformation activity by Russian sources aiming to suppress turnout and influence voter preferences,” the report said. The report was the first official substantiation by the European Commission of the role that Russians and other groups played in disinformation in the May elections, which many investigators, academics and advocacy groups had warned about. It was a reminder of how active Russians and others continue to be in spreading isive content online to inflame and stoke electorates all over the world, a strategy that the Kremlin had pioneered in the 2016 US presidential election.Since then, Facebook, Twitter and others have vowed to clamp down on foreign interference and have worked on new technology and other methods to stop outside meddling during elections. But the report Friday highlighted how much work the platforms still needed to do to stay a step ahead of disinformation networks. The report also has implications for American officials ahead of the 2020 presidential election, with an increasing number of smaller, harder-to-detect domestic groups adopting Russia-like strategies to influence voters.Disinformation campaigns“The genie’s out of the bottle,” said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who has been tracking disinformation efforts in Europe. “What we’ve seen over the past few years is an increasing number of actors, both state and nonstate, using similar methods online to interfere in democratic processes.”European officials did not draw a direct link in the report between the disinformation campaigns and the Kremlin or provide details about what groups in Russia or elsewhere were behind the efforts. The report also stopped short of assessing whether the tactics had an effect on how people voted, with turnout in the elections having hit record levels. The report largely cited the findings of outside researchers who had been tracking the European elections.Yet European officials said the report was significant because it highlighted the “new normal” of disinformation campaigns. “There was no Big Bang moment. There was no new Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case that we know of,” Vera Jourova, a European commissioner, said during a news conference in Brussels. Yet “the European elections were not free of disinformation.” She added that the continued online meddling was “something we cannot accept.”Facebook said it had taken steps to protect the integrity of the European elections, including entering into partnerships with local fact-checking organizations, adopting new rules to show who was buying political ads on its platform and dedicating teams of employees to monitor election interference.“The fight against false news will never be over,” the Silicon Valley company said in a statement in response to the report. “That is why we are making significant investments to remove fake accounts and clickbait and to promote high-quality journalism and news literacy.”Twitter and Google did not respond to requests for comment. Independent investigators had long warned that Europe was vulnerable to disinformation campaigns ahead of last month’s vote. But eradicating disinformation campaigns was tricky in the elections, which were spread across 28 countries and 24 official languages.US presidential campaign 2020In the run-up to the voting, researchers highlighted efforts by Russia-linked groups and those in favour of far-right policies to use Facebook and Twitter to spread false information and exaggerate political isions. In particular, they identified hundreds of Facebook and Twitter accounts peddling disinformation, more than 1,000 examples of WhatsApp messages sharing suspicious materials and a mix of suspicious websites that spread varying degrees of misleading information– often taking advantage of local political isions.According to Friday’s report, Facebook blocked more than 1,700 pages, groups and accounts engaged in inauthentic behaviour targeting EU countries during the first three months of 2019. Voters in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain were among those targeted. Jourova said Russian meddling had been detected in 1,000 cases since January.US intelligence officials have warned that the 2020 campaign will also be targeted by foreign groups. In January, the Worldwide Threat Assessment written by government intelligence agencies said Russia would continue to use social media to amplify social and racial tensions in an effort to influence policy and elections.The European Commission report said new internet regulations might be needed, rather than a reliance on the companies to abide by a voluntary code of conduct. The commission said it would complete a review by the end of the year that could result in new laws.“More needs to be done by the platforms to effectively tackle disinformation,” the report said. Last month’s vote was seen as a referendum on Europe’s direction. On one side were nationalist and populist groups skeptical of the European Union’s influence on national affairs on the other were those seeking more integration and cooperation. The results were mixed, with far-right groups performing well in some countries and liberal parties doing better in others.‘The new normal’The election demonstrated a shift in disinformation strategy. The report said the efforts were smaller and more localised than Russia’s widespread effort during the 2016 US campaign. Far-right groups and other nonstate actors have also adopted the techniques, the report found.Nimmo said governments would continue to find it difficult to stop groups committed to using online platforms to spread disinformation and sow discord. He said that in addition to focusing on big companies such as Facebook and Twitter, authorities should scrutinize smaller sites such as Gab and Parler.“The commission says that this sort of behaviour should not become the new normal,” he said. “That’s right, but hopelessly optimistic.” One emerging challenge for governments and social media platforms is that groups are not sharing outright false information, making the content harder to detect and remove. Instead, social media posts tend to take highly politicised views on news events of the day, such as immigration.The report pointed to stories that said last month’s collapse of the government in Austria, which was a real event, was the result of the “European deep state.” Other posts said the recent Notre Dame cathedral fire in Paris occurred because of a decline of Western and Christian values. –New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926042.1560527692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the outsider candidate with a vital message for democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper speaks during the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, California on June 1st. Photograph: Stephen LamReutersThe next US presidential election may be 17 months away, but the race to become the Democratic nominee is well under way.In echoes of the Republican campaign for 2016, which saw dozens compete to become the party’s nominee, this time it’s Democrats who are jostling in a crowded field. Twenty-four candidates have thrown their hat in the ring, arguing that they are the right person to take on Donald Trump in 2020.Although the entry of Joe Biden into the race in April changed the dynamic of the contest as he rapidly became the frontrunner, it’s early days.One of the presidential hopefuls is John Hickenlooper. This week the former Colorado governor brought his wares to Washington, where he addressed the National Press Club.In such a crowded field it’s tricky to stand out from the crowd. Hickenlooper can’t even depend on being the candidate with the unusual name – he has tough competition in this regard from Pete Buttigieg, the youthful mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is now widely known as “Mayor Pete” such is the confusion about the pronunciation of his Maltese surname.But while Hickenlooper may not be a household name, he comes to the table with a respectable political record.Walked the walkA former two-term mayor of Denver who was governor of Colorado between 2011 and 2018, Hickenlooper is popular in his home state. He presided over a strong economy and left office having implemented a range of progressive social measures such as the legalisation of marijuana and the expansion of pre-kindergarten education.He has an interesting personal story to boot – having been made redundant as a geologist in the 1980s, he started a brewery business in a neglected area of downtown Denver, before running for mayor.Though the genial 67-year-old is trailing at about 1 per cent in the polls, he made no apologies about his decision at his event in Washington. “I am the only person running who has actually done what everyone else is talking about.”He promptly turned his attention to Bernie Sanders, lambasting the vision of “democratic socialism” outlined by the Vermont senator earlier in the week.“I fundamentally disagree that we should do away with the Democratic regulated capitalism that has guided this country for over 200 years,” he said, criticising his colleagues for not calling Sanders out.“Democrats must say loudly and clearly that we are not socialists. If we do not we will end up helping to re-elect the worst president in American history,” he said, correctly pointing out that Republicans are effectively using the socialist label to attack Democrats in the run-up to the election.Refreshing optimismInstead, Hickenlooper, a self-made millionaire, is firmly positioning himself as a centrist. Pointing to his experience in governing Colorado, he said that “sometimes you have to talk to Republicans”. American capitalism has to be reformed, he said, but this can’t be done by “endlessly expanding government or by demonising the private sector”.His message is that Medicare for all – the idea of a universal, government-paid healthcare programme – and the Green New Deal – a climate-conscious government investment programme – are pie-in-the-sky policies which won’t wash with most Americans.Nonetheless, for all his big ideas, Hickenlooper is unlikely to make the cut when the Democratic field whittles down. Though he just reached the threshold to qualify as one of the 20 Democratic candidates taking part in the first debate later this month in Miami, he faces formidable competition from better-known candidates such as Biden, senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.This is not stopping him from trying, however. He has made several trips to early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina since announcing his candidacy in March.His sunny brand of optimism is refreshing. It also offers some lessons for those who are more likely to be in the race for the long haul.Over the past few months, he said, he has been struck by how consistent voters’ concerns are in each state – healthcare is the top-ranking issue, he says, followed by climate change and economic stability. “We’ve gotten to a place in this country that a majority of Americans don’t think they’re going to be better off than they are in 10 years than they are today,” he says.As Democrats begin the process of deciding who is best-positioned to win back the White House in 2020, taking those concerns on board is vital if the party wants to connect with voters."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of Justice\u0026#39I\u0026#39ve been portrayed as a psychopathic man-eating whore\u0026#39  - Amanda Knox  breaks down in tearful first return to ItalyTudor banqueting house where Queen Elizabeth I celebrated Spanish Armada defeat discovered in GloucestershireDuke of Kent, 83, involved in car crash with student in BrightonPlenty, Chichester Festival Theatre, review: Rachael Stirling triumphs as a fearless Bond-like figure in David Hare revivalSudan crisis: What is happening, and where does it go from here?Richard Ratcliffe joins his wife Nazanin in hunger strike to put pressure on Iran for her releaseComment: With Boris for PM, where do you put the rest of them in the ultimate fantasy cabinet?House of Commons staff given Brexit bonus totalling £700,000 for late nights and cancelled holidaysRoyal Collection joins escape room craze as it opens Queen\u0026#39s Gallery Leonardo da Vinci exhibition to playersTwo teenagers killed within minutes of each other in London stabbing and shooting Tributes paid two years on from the Grenfell disasterRAF helicopters scramble to Lincolnshire town amid devastating floods Activist arrested in Russia for marijuana days after journalist released in groundless drugs caseJeremy Corbyn says he has seen \u0026#39no credible evidence\u0026#39 Iran is to blame for oil tanker attackComment: Only a new brand of BoJoism can make \u0026#39Boris the buffoon\u0026#39 a truly great PMNotre-Dame to host first mass since devastating fireRAF sergeant jailed for role in £1 million drug smuggling ringRussian bots tried to influence EU elections, says BrusselsRoyals give seed fund to wounded warriors helping medical scienceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

More than 1.2 million people born in the 1950s reported owning an additional property - including buy-to-let and overseas - between 2014 and 2016.The number of British adults who own a second property has grown by 53 per cent since 2001, sitting at 5.5 million people and a total value of £941 billion.The figures come despite the overall decline of home ownership across the UK, which peaked in 2003 at 58 per cent of families but then continued falling until 2016.The rise in multiple property ownership is down to a “rapid growth” in the number of people buying houses in Britain to rent out, the report said, with almost two million people - the majority being older, higher income and southern - owning buy-to-lets.The second home boom has also benefited millennials, with seven per cent of those born in the 1960s and 1980s having additional property wealth by the age of 29,  the Foundation’s Game of Homes report found.The “surprisingly rapid rise” of multiple property ownership among the young generation could mean that those currently in their 30s may be on the way to similar rates of additional property ownership as today’s middle-aged cohorts.“If we were to redraw the chart of additional property ownership by age in thirty years’ time, there is a chance it might not look particularly different from today,” the report said.Buy to letThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Yutaka Katada, the company president, said reports of a mine attack were false.Both vessels suffered explosions, forcing crews to abandon ship and leave them adrift in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran. All crew members were safely evacuated.Navy Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, said the Revolutionary Guard vessel was observed at 4.10pm local time approaching the Kokuka Courageous.He said: It was observed and recorded removing the unexploded limpet mine from the Kokuka Courageous.He added: The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: Taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.Mr Pompeo said American assessment of Iran\u0027s responsibility was based on intelligence sources, the weapons used and the level of expertise, saying no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.In a statement the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Tehran categorically rejects the US unfounded claim with regard to 13 June oil tanker incidents and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.It accused the United States and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, of warmongering.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the UK believed the US assessment that Iran was responsible but repeated his warning there was a serious danger of the US and Iran stumbling into an unwanted war. “We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it because they are our closest ally, Mr Hunt told the Today programme. “We are very worried about the situation in Iran because at the moment both sides in this dispute think the other side doesn’t want war and the risk you have is that then they doing something provocative that leads to catastrophic consequences that weren’t intended.” The explosions, which left one of the oil tankers burning outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway, marked the most serious incident since the White House warned in early May that Iran was plotting attacks in the region.    The incident came one month after Iranian forces allegedly used naval mines to blow holes in two oil tankers and two smaller ships off the Emirati port of Fujairah. The US publicly said Iran was behind that attack, while Tehran denied responsibility. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe” the incident in Gulf of Oman. He previously suggested without evidence that Israel was staging the attacks to undermine Iran.   Responding to Mr Zarif\u0027s comments, Mr Pompeo said:  Foreign Minister Zarif may think this is funny but no one else in the world does.The explosions at sea came hours before Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met with Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on a diplomatic mission intended to try to ease tensions between Iran and the US.But the Japanese leader’s efforts appeared to bear little fruit. Ayatollah Khamenei refused to hear any messages from Donald Trump delivered by Mr Abe, the Iranian government said. The ayatollah also said Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons but “America could not do anything” to stop Tehran if it did decide to pursue a nuclear course. Mr Trump on Thursday ruled out the possibility of making a deal with Iran, saying: While I very much appreciate PM Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!Both tankers were carrying “Japanese-related” cargo, according to Japan’s government. It was not clear if that was a coincidence or if the targeting of the ships was done deliberately to coincide with Mr Abe’s visit to Tehran.   While Iran’s civilian government denies responsibility for any of the attacks, it is possible that the Revolutionary Guard, who answer directly to the supreme leader, are carrying out operations without the government’s knowledge or consent. Iran tries to keep tensions between the two sides concealed but they spilled into the open early this year when Mr Zarif threatened to resign after he was left out of a key meeting while a senior Revolutionary Guard commander was invited.Markets Hub I Brent SpotThe attacks capped six weeks of building tensions between Iran and the US during which time Mr Trump has ordered an aircraft carrier, a bomber taskforce and 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East.  Both the US and Iran say they are not looking for war but Britain and other countries have warned of the danger that the two sides could stumble into an unintended conflict. Antonio Gutteres, the UN secretary general, condemned the attack and warned that the world cannot afford “a major confrontation in the Gulf region”. Any fighting near the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway which transports 20 per cent of the world’s oil, would likely cause serious damage to global energy supplies.Analysts said that Iran appeared to be lashing out in order to send a message in response to crippling US sanctions imposed by Mr Trump after he withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal.“I think Iran is showing that it has teeth,” said Charles Hollis, a former British diplomat in Tehran who is now managing director of the Falanx Assynt consultancy. “It’s a way of showing that if they are backed into a corner they are not without means of causing grief.” Iran has warned that it will begin enriching high-grade uranium, the kind that could be used for a nuclear weapon, in July unless Europe finds a way to get around US sanctions and prop up the Iranian oil and banking sectors.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

dioptres – a measurement of the focusing power of the lenses needed to correct her eyesight.A person with mild myopia registers somewhere between -. and -D.He told Wired this was due to the eyeball growing, especially in populations of Asian descent, and causing severe visual impairment, through glaucoma retinal detachment and other retinal problems.He said: The initial theory for this is that people are doing more near-plane reading activity with smartphones which is encouraging the eye to become myopic to meet that environmental need.Mr Bastawrous added that another factor was that people are now spending less time outdoors than we did previously.He suggested that people were not getting enough UV light exposure, which was a likely predictive factor for becoming very shortsighted.The eye specialist added: So spending time looking at near targets like smartphones may be contributing but that also means that children are not spending time outside, playing outdoors and kicking a football around, which is having a knock-on effect of not looking out into infinity very often.Many people no longer spend time looking at the stars and the mountains, theyre looking at screens more often instead.Dr Liu Wei, at the Yangzhou Maternal and Child Care Service Centre, said the girl’s case was down to prolonged and premature usage of electronic devices.A report from the World Health Organisation in April recommended toddlers under the age of one should not be exposed to electronic screens and that kids between the age of two and four should be limited to no more than one hour of “sedentary screen time” a day.According to figures released by China’s National Health Commission, the overall myopia rate in kids and adolescents was . per cent in  and in high school students it was  per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"hunters mountain lion wyoming yellowstone","story":"Austin Peterson, , Trey Juhnke, , and Corbin Simmons, , were sentenced last month to a three-year worldwide hunting ban after authorities tracked them down via social media.According to investigation documents, other hunters alerted game wardens to photos of the three men from Montana posing with their illegal mountain lion kill, which had been shared to Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.In one of the photos posted to social media, two of the men are standing behind a horizontal tree branch that the dead animal is draped over.In another, one of the young men is holding up the leless dead animal with a smile on his face.After the arrest, Yellowstone special agent Jake Olson told reporters: “We ended up getting a lot of this information from a guy in Bozeman off of Facebook because of a bunch of stuff on social media.Fox reports that each of the men admitted to shooting the mountain lion in the park on December  of last year, before taking it back to their vehicle across the border.But they later changed their story when authorities interviewed them separately.The three men contradicted details in each other’s accounts, including details of the location of the boundary posts, the colour of Peterson’s GPS screen when it supposedly maled and who shot at the lion.Authorities learned that all three men had fired at the mature male lion, which was shot eight times and killed it after it crossed the border into Yellowstone.The men’s actions were found to be in violation of the Lacey Act of , per the National Park Service, which prohibits the taking, selling or purchasing of wildle from protected areas.Hunting mountain lions is legal in the state of Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, but the trio had deliberately crossed the parks borders and killed the animal in a protected area.They also tried to sneak the animal back to their car without telling authorities -

I was doing my job. I was ordered to go there, so I went. I wasnt afraid,” he said, the MailOnline reported.“Immediately I heard a noise that meant the water was draining.

He looked like he had the worries of the world on his shoulders.”But after news came through that a deal — which will still see around  of his UK stores close and around , jobs at risk — had been agreed, Green could at least unwind on his £million superyacht moored nearby.It has been a tumultuous week in a scandal-hit few years for the retail magnate. On Tuesday another woman broke cover in the US to accuse him of sexual harassment.Fitness instructor Jenner McAmis claimed she had to wear several jackets to deter the “grabby” businessman from trying to grope her.Jenner, , told The Sun she was speaking out for the women in the UK who were muzzled by a court order brought by the tycoon last year.Croydon-born Green, , has separately been charged with four counts of assault for allegedly groping Pilates instructor Katie Surridge.The case is due to be heard on Wednesday but Green, who denies the claims, is not expected to attend.The business boss has also been engulfed by accusations of sexist, racist and bullying behaviour towards staff.Some alleged victims have been prevented from speaking out due to controversial non-disclosure agreements.In May the man once celebrated for his Midas touch was again accused of groping his female staff.Under protection of Parliamentary privilege, Lord Hain revealed that an alleged whistleblower had told him Green was “touching and repeatedly slapping women staff’s bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs”.The series of scandals has led to growing demands that he be stripped of his knighthood from, among others, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and MPs Frank Field and Jess Phillips.Downing Street insists it is a matter for independent review.Green’s fall from grace began after BHS, the retail chain he sold in March  for £, went into administration leaving a £million hole in its pension fund.He later agreed a £million cash settlement to plug the gap.The businessman has spent years commuting to work in Britain, flying in on a £million Gulfstream private jet and staying at Mayfair’s luxury Dorchester Hotel before ing to Monaco for the weekend.But now it seems he wants to move to the French principality for good.A friend said recently: “He doesn’t want to be in Britainhe’s not wanted here. He feels he’s been treated appallingly and has no desire to come back.”The Met police has been under pressure to launch an investigation into Green’s alleged sexual harassment, and friends believe he could be targeted more easilyhe s.In Monaco, Green lives in a -storey tower where Beatle Ringo Starr once owned an apartment and where the cheapest flats sell for £million.According to locals, Green is often seen strolling down Avenue Princesse Grace on the seafront, one of the most expensive streets in the world.After the BHS scandal broke, there were reports that some of his Monaco friends had cooled on him.One prominent resident was “thoroughly p***ed off” with him, saying that he had dragged “the whole principality into the dirt”.Another neighbour claimed “people don’t want to be associated with him in the way they used to be”.Few of those names would want to be pictured with him now, and it is doubtful we will again witness scenes as extravagant as his £million th birthday party back in .For that celebration he was joined in Mexico by guests including Kate Hudson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Simon Cowell and Naomi Campbell.Music came from Robbie Williams and The Beach Boys, while Michael Buble duetted with his daughter Chloe.Since then Simon Cowell has made his change of feelings perfectly clear — in November last year he paid around £million to buy back Green’s five per cent stake in his company Syco.The tycoon has also lost several female aides in the wake of the #MeToo scandal.In February Baroness Karren Brady, a columnist on The Sun On Sunday, quit as chairman of Taveta Investments, the holding company which owns Arcadia.Non-executive director Sharon Brown and in-house solicitor Deborah Cooper also left the company.In March Green was dumped by PR firm Maitland AMO after they decided his reputation was “too toxic”.And according to The Sunday Times Rich List, he has lost his coveted billionaire status, with his fortune dropping from £.billion to £million over the past  months.Green, who is married to Tina and has children Chloe and Brandon, is now th on the list.Daughter Chloe has also been making headlines lately.Her relationship with “Hot Felon” Jeremy Meeks is reportedly on the rocks after she posed without her engagement ring at a charity gala this month.The -year-old heiress was said to be upset that Meeks did not attend their son Jayden’s first birthday party, and was instead pictured in Calornia a few days previously.Meeks, who has been snapped cosying up to other women in the past few weeks, is also refusing to sign a pre-nup agreement that the Greens requested.It seems Green has plenty to think about as he strolls in the Monaco sunshine.The rump of his retail empire, which also includes Burton, Wallis and Evans, may have been saved for now, but it is under pressure from online competition, hefty business rates and changing fashion tastes.At one of his doomed UK stores, Topshop in Ashton-under-Lyne, Gtr Manchester, signs were advertising reductions of up to  per cent.Asked about the reported store closure, one young employee said: “We’ve been told not to say anything.”Passing shoppers said they had been put off buying from Topshop by Green’s alleged behaviour.Jessica Gregson, a -year-old carer, said: “I wouldn’t shop there as it’s expensive and I’m really put off by Sir Philip Green and how he’s accused of acting towards women. It’s all horribly sleazy.” Her mum Jo, , said: “It’s not what it used to be. It’s a shame as people are losing jobs.”Simone Clutton, , who works in a cosmetics shop, was coming out of the store having not bought anything.The mum of two said: “I think it is a bit old fashioned now and they haven’t really kept up with the age of internet shopping.“Less and less people go to his shops but I think Sir Philip’s reputation has something to do with that. He’s seen as sleazy and a bully and that does put women off especially.”The day after the vote to save his empire, Green’s ft superyacht Lionheart steamed into Monaco after coming down the coast from Italy.Its arrival will make a welcome distraction for a man whose world is in turmoil.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It sees a mystery youngster unleash a rocket from just inside her own half, which wrong-foots the boy in the opposition net and flies in. But what caught our eye was the looks of utter shock on the faces of the boys who canapost quite believe what has happened. Football has the power to change lives - but moments like this prove it’s not just the players at the top of the game who are making a dference.  It’s on the local parks and playing fields where le-changing moments are happening everyday, right across the UK.  Since , players of The National Lottery have raised £billion for good causes, with over £ million being used to support grassroots football initiatives. That’s money that has been raised by you. For every ticket sold, a slice of the money received goes to a huge iety of projects, big and small.  From building new football venues, to inspiring future generations to participate, projects like these have helped thousands of people improve their lives, and made Britain’s communities a better place to live and work.  It’s thanks to National Lottery funding that young players like -year-old Charlie Fryhas found a route into football - despite his disability. Charlie was devastated when he was told he was unable to play mainstream football after being diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome seven years ago.  Then his mother Rachel and father Lee discovered Team United, a Scottish-based charity which has received National Lottery funding and offers young players with disabilities a route back into the game. As mum Rachel explains, the results have been le-changing. “Charlie was seven when he was diagnosed. “We were told that because of his sensory issues, he’ll wouldn’t be able to play football which was devastating for him.  “But Team United came at just the right time. The coaches there can read his body language, and understand it. They know how to coach children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. “He’s now back playing mainstream football with Bathgate Thistle Whites  and they won West Lothian County Cup final last year, with Charlie being voted the team’s player of the year.” Another youngster to benefit is Sophie Brett , who has been able to turn her le around thanks to National Lottery funding.  The -year-old battled PTSD and turned to self-harming after a dficult childhood saw her taken into foster care. But thanks to Swansea-based charity Street Football Wales, which received £k of National Lottery funding in March, Sophie has started to turn her le around. “I’d always had a passion for football and in  my support worker put me in touch with Street Football Wales, who brought me along to a match day once a month, she explained.  “The staff there have all the time in the world to help anyone and everyone – it’s a safe environment to be in. I’m a much better person and my le is much brighter. “There’s light at the end of the tunnel now.” - An average of  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district - £bn raised for good causes since - Around £m a week to good causes- Over  local football projects supported across the UK   Former army medic and computer engineer Bahman Jamalaldini is another deserving benefactor of lottery funding. His le was turned upside-down when he contracted meningococcal meningitis in  and had to undergo a series of amputations – but National Lottery-funded charity LimbPower soon helped him back on to his new prosthetic feet. “I’ve always loved playing football but I thought my playing days were over,” says Bahman, , from Milton Keynes.  “After weeks in hospital I thought what sort of le is a quadruple amputee like me going to lead  Then I heard about LimbPower which helps amputees and those with physical impairments take part in sports and other activities. “We all bonded with each other playing football, which amazingly I discovered I was still able to do with prosthetic legs. “I’ve discovered, thanks in large part to LimbPower, that I can pretty much do all the sports I did before and live le again to the full.” Hayley Stringfellow, Head of Brand Marketing at Camelot, commented: “Players of National Lottery games raise around £m for good causes every week.

Geoff Smith, , had his demonstration livestreamed on Facebook in a bid to fight for Bobbiemayaposs legal right to an education. The -year-old was allegedly sent home from Cockburn John Charles Academy in Belle Isle, Leeds for wearing the discreet, clear earring, which her family says helps ease her migraines.So Geoff, a self-employed roofer, covered his hands with glue and a type of plaster called Polyfilla and stuck them to two metal bars outside the school. His protest lasted around one hour but he eventually pulled his hands free when ordered to do so by police. A layer of skin remained attached to the bars.    During the standoff, the father said: I have superglued myself to the gate. My daughter has got a legal right to an education. The superglue is burning my hands at the minute... but I would put myself through any pain so my daughter can live le without pain. After less than a minute a worker from the school comes over and asks: What are you doing . Geoff, who works as a roofer, instructs the man to call the fire brigade.   West Yorkshire Police and the fire service attended the scene during lunchtime. When Geoff yanked himself free, he entered the school to talk to senior staff.Bobbiemay got the piercing in her tragus - the middle part of the outer ear - five weeks ago. Alternative medicine proponents argue some ear piercings stimulate nerves under the skin and muscle tissues, thereby producing pain-relieving substances, such as endorphins. Geoff says the piece of jewellery is not a fashion statement and that he bought the smallest, most inconspicuous stud he could to avoid it being an issue at school.  Speaking yesterday, he said: Itaposs awful for a school to deprive a child of their education for something so minor. We tried everything to stop Bobbiemayaposs migraines - she can be in agonising pain for a week at a time with them. But she hasnapost had one since getting the piercing five weeks ago. The piercing is working, itaposs not coming out. He added: Bobbiemay was doing really well at that school so thataposs where I want her go go back to. Sheaposs missed a lot of school now and itaposs not fair. Sheaposs an intelligent child and they have had no other issues with her until now.  Cockburn John Charles Academy, which serves more than , children, opened in April last year. It is yet to have an OFSTED inspection as a result. In a statement this week, it said: We would like to make it clear Bobbiemay Smith has not been excluded from the academy. She is welcome back at any time, as long as the earring is removed. Students and parents are aware of our clear unorm policy which is applied consistently. In this particular case, medical evidence or a doctoraposs note has not been provided to suggest exceptional circumstances.

The -year-old dad-of-two spoke about his horric experience at the hands of sepsis to an audience of nurses and medics from the Royal College of Nursingat its annual congress.Tom explained the role Leicester Cityaposs miracle Premier League victory in   played in his personal journey to recovery.    He said: “Football is another thing. As soon as I was able I learnt to drive again and that meant that I could take the kids to school. “It also meant that I could secretly, as this was my main aim, take my son Freddie to watch Leicester City. “The club has this wonderful thing with the disabled supporters group where they give you a season ticket on a discount. I paid £. Then they give you a season ticket for free to go with it, which is your carer’s ticket.    “And Freddie, who was six years old, was my carer. “They actually gave him a card with his photo on it that said he was my carer – and it was like his best thing. “He used to take me to the football and, whenever I stood up and started giving it some he’d say ‘Dad, sit down... sit downapos. “Then at half-time, he used to go off and get me a cup of tea. “He took that role really seriously and we’ve been going ever since to every home game.”  The first match Freddie and Tom went to see Leicester play they were at the bottom of League One. Their rise to the top of the to ision hammered home that you can come back from a disaster.” It was while Tom was in a coma that his we Nic gave birth to Freddie, the couple’s second child. He had enjoyed a successful career as a corporate banker and was about to set up a business with his we when he fell sick, with symptoms including vomiting and a thumping headache.  Tom was taken to hospital in Peterborough, however, it took another five hours before sepsis was diagnosed – time he believes was lost as his body was ravaged by the infection. His recovery has involved lots of plastic surgery, learning to walk and drive again, and figuring out how to get by day-to-day with prosthetic limbs.Tom now works in a call centre and, together with Nic and former nurse and NHS chief executive Pippa Bagnall, set up  Resilience and Co  to raise awareness and deliver motivational talks. Now Tom and Nic are campaigning for mandatory training for NHS staff and increased awareness of the importance of early sepsis diagnosis.In  Tomaposs story was turned into an acclaimed film called Starfish.

Paris Glover, , has also never been late to Archbishop Sentamu Academy and Stockwell Primary School in Hull. Even when she has been ill, Paris has never felt like she needed to take a day off. My parents are my motivation. If it was not for them I would have given up straight away but there is no point in just giving up, she told Hull Daily Mail . In primary I used to really like school and I did it one year not having a day off and it is just something I have kept up with. I liked primary school more than I liked secondary. I think it is less important and less stressful and you can just chillax in primary, but secondary is more uptight.    If I feel ill I go to school and I feel better. I don’t feel bad when I’m at school. The dedicated teenager, of Greatfield, Hull, is expected to achieve mostly  to  grades in her GCSE’s, with  to ’s in photography and drama. She intends to go to college and possibly join the armed forces as a combat medic. The pupil continued: Geography is one of my favourite subjects because my teacher Mr Greenhough is really good. I also enjoy photography, Mr Capper used to be my form teacher and he is head of photographer and also a good teacher. I also like English and I do cadets and drama after-school.    I want to go into public services. I really want to go in the army one day as a combat medic and then become a paramedic when I come out. I want to do stuff like forensic science and work in a psychiatric hospital trying to people through their struggles. But I want to go into the army first to get my confidence up and work from there.  Parisapos father, John Manolasses, said: It is a great achievement. I said to heryou can do it one year you can do it another and keep going. The more you go to school the more you learn. I don’t think they will see kids like her again and I don’t just mean with her going to school I mean with her commitment with going to school. There was one day where her mum said she had to get up for school and Paris thought it was time to go. As she was heading to school there was no children and she thought she was late and started running.  By the time she got through the school gates the caretaker said to her ‘you do know it is only seven o’clock’. She arrived one hour and  minutes before she was meant to be there. She never realised. Archbishop Sentamu Academy Principal Chay Bell described Paris’ % attendance record as a fantastic achievement. He said: To achieve  per cent attendance throughout your time in school is a fantastic achievement. It shows your commitment and fortitude. Studies show that good attendance, more often than not, lead to excellent outcomes.   We are all incredibly proud of Paris at the Academy and look forward to having many more students with  per cent in the coming years. Her family are rightly sharing her story with the city of Hull.  Christy Coulter has been the headteacher at Stockwell Primary School for nine years and has fond memories of Paris’ ‘unique’ attendance record in primary school and was not surprised she managed to keep it going. He said: “I remember the occasion well, we marked it by buying Paris a bike. It is not something we have done before or since. “It is one of those unique achievements and I am not surprised she has carried it on.  “She was a lovely child, always happy. A very determined inidual and this is part of her character. She was strongly supported by her family who were always proud of her achievements. “It is quite dficult to not be off because children get ill and it is part of growing up. Children need to build up that resilience and she is a great example to children to keep on going. “I’m really proud and Paris’ achievement reflects on the whole community of Greatfield and east Hull.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family find secret fleet classic","story":"NewsFamily find secret fleet of classic motorbikes hidden in sheds after owner diesRelatives of the owner, from Medway, Kent, had no idea of his secret stash until they found a file full of registration details when he diedShareByLouie Smith:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe bikes were hidden in a cellar, sheds and a garage\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA stash of classic motorbikes hoarded by an enthusiast over seven decades is set to fetch up to £, at auction.

Danielle, and her husband, Tony, , from Market Weighton, York, spent their savings on two rounds of IVF and they are now over the moon to be expecting twins. She said: I woke up after  days in a coma to find my left arm had been amputated, my parents had to make the decision for me.  My arm had been pushed out of the car window and the car rolled on it.

Danielle, Tony and Ethan are now excited for the future and to become a family of five. She added: We were absolutely ecstatic when we found out we are having twins, and are ridiculously excited to meet them. People wonder will I manage with just one arm, but I am very capable and I am always finding new ways to do things. It may take me a little longer to do things like tie my hair but I can still drive and look after myself and family.

Earlier in the flight a man was filmed swearing at another traveller several rows behind him before being urged to sit down by a woman. The recipient of his verbal barrage was stood next to an air steward who tried to calm the passenger down, only to be blasted with another volley of abuse as she walked towards the cockpit.    The woman who posted the footage said in a message: “Off to a eerrmmmm interesting start with this idiot abusing easyJet staff on our Ibiza flight. “Staff handled it very well and he was removed by police.” The incident happened on board easyJet flight EZY from London Stansted to Ibiza on Friday morning.

A spokesman for easyJet said: “We can confirm that flight EZY from London Stansted to Ibiza on  June was met by police on arrival in Ibiza due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board. “Our cabin crew are highly trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time.    “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board. “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always our highest priority.” The Civil Guard is not thought to have made any arrests.

Ben Carpenter has been dubbed a apossuper dadapos by his friends and family after becoming a dad of five having finalised the adoption of his son Noah. The -year-old from Huddersfield initially only wanted to adopt one child when he was -years-old. Ten years on Ben has a sizeable brood and doesnapost write off adopting more.    With a range of disabilities, his children, Jack, , Ruby, eight, Lily, six, Joseph, three, and Noah, one, all have complex needs, from autism to Pierre Robin syndrome. The full time dad said: Even at the age of  I knew I wanted to be a father as soon as possible - I may have only been young but Iaposve always had an old head on my shoulders. I was convinced with me being single as well that they wouldnapost take me seriously - but I was over the moon when they did. Due to previously working with disabled adults and children, I knew it was only right for me to adopt a disabled child because I knew Iaposd be able to care for them properly. I originally saw an advertisement from local adoption social services looking for adoptive parents and I thought, well, theyaposre not going to want me as a single guy.    But I told them who I was and where I worked and they were really positive and quite enthusiastic about me adopting a child. Nine years on, I have five children and I wouldnapost change a thing. Jack has autism, Ruby has Pierre Robin syndrome and limited use of her arms because of missing bones, Lily is deaf and Joseph has Down Syndrome. Noah has Cornelia de Lange syndrome which affect both his arms and legs. Ben says since he become part of the family itaposs like heaposs aposalways been thereapos.    The dad said: Noah is great and has fit in to our family just perfectly and, to be honest, itaposs like always been there. His new brothers and sisters are great with him, Lily in particular is extremely maternal and helps me feed Noah and things. The full time dad was never bothered about having biological children as he says adopting is just as good. Ben added: Iaposve never wanted biological children because thereaposs much, much more than just being biologically linked to a child. My children are my children - for example they have the same mannerisms as me.    Yes, the might not have the same blood as me, but who cares. I donapost currently plan on adopting more children but Iaposm one of these people who never says never. If in the future a child really needed me and my help, Iaposm sure I would end up adopting them. I definitely see myself fostering more children though - I just love being a dad. Ben explained how he instantly aposfell in loveapos with Noah when he first saw him and knew he needed to join his family.    The dad-of-five said: I was flicking through an adoption magazine that comes from monthly featuring children who are deemed as aposhard to placeapos children, when I came across this picture of a little baby boy who quite clearly had severe complex needs. I thought to myself aposthis little boy needs to join our family where he can be part of something specialapos, but more importantly someone who can accept him and his disability. I instantly fell in love with him what with his mass of brown hair and his beautul blue eyes I knew instantly I wanted him to be by son. Ben has remained single since the young age of  and doesnapost plan on looking for a relationship any time soon, with his dad duties being the most important thing to him.    He added: I have never sought a relationship, as I am happy on my own.

But the warm weather could be short-lived, forecasters warn, as beyond Wednesday conditions will be more changeable.There will be some rainfall over the next few days - but not like the wet weather seen this week. Rainfall will not be as heavy and persistent but parts of western and eastern Scotland will see a few showers on Saturday morning. Northwest England and the Midlands will have a wet start with a few showers and sunny spells breaking out.   Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Daily Star : We are expecting to see high pressure rebuild during the early part of next week and we expect to see temperatures possibly hitting the mid-s or even higher by the middle of the week.This is most likely across the south and east of the country as we have warm air coming up from the continent where temperatures are going to get into the s. However, this is going to be short-lived, beyond Wednesday it is going to turn more changeable, but the pattern of almost incessant rain is going to come to an end. There is some more rain forecast over the next few days but it is going to be nothing like what we have seen through this week.    The Environment Agency has warned that river levels remain high following a particularly wet week, and advised people to take care in case of any remaining flood risk. They will continue to work with emergency services in the area over the weekend on measures to tackle the flooding. Brighter weather will be seen in the eastern part of Britain as the area in between Norwich and Canterbury will enjoy C by midday today.  Meteorologist Helen Roberts said rain will move eastwards across the country throughout Saturday, adding that Wainfleet should escape the worst of it. She said: It will still be unsettled with further showers, but not the persistent rain that we saw earlier in the week, and we should have some warmer temperatures too. Sunday will see a similar mix of sunshine and showers - and temperatures could rise to C in the south-east of the country, she added.

Lucie Chaligne, from Nottingham, said she struggled with her weight for most of her le, and thought she just had to accept her bigger frame.But after dropping from a dress size - to an -, Lucie says she feels reborn, reports the Nottingham Post .The -year-old said: Iaposve always been overweight since I was probably eight years old, and I just thought you stay like that, and you canapost do anything about it. But I wasnapost happy, and I wasnapost comfortable in my body, even in front of my friends. We were on holiday and we had a jacuzzi, and I just couldnapost bring myself to go in.    After a fitness coach visited her office at work, Lucy decided to sign up for the programme. But stepping on the scales, she was shocked when realised her weight had crept up to st lb.After beginning her weight loss journey in April , Lucy managed to drop st and six dress sizes before the year was out.She said her new figure has given her more confidence, as well as a new outlook on health and nutrition. Lucie said: I have enjoyed salsa dancing for the past two years, but it was getting tough with my weight.I really wanted to change, and when my office had a visit from a fitness coach , showing their new weight loss plans, I was interested. I got weighed, and when I saw the three digit number come up, showing I was almost kgI couldnapost believe it. I just thought it canapost be happening. Lucie took part in a week-long trial of the diet plan presented by Paramount Fitness, and a -day detox, which she said she found hard. She added: But everyone was so friendly and all this time I would hate going to the gym because people would look at me, but with the coaches I found it was possible. Through the fitness group, I was educated in training and nutrition, so not only was I losing fat but I was gaining muscle. Lucie then decided to sign up to a six week body transformation programme, again with Paramount Fitness, and managed to lose more than a stone.    The plan consisted of three exercise sessions at the gym each week, and Lucie used a list of healthy foods compiled by the fitness programme to help her get into a good routine. After the six weeks were up, she signed up for a further six months, and by the end of the year had dropped down to st lb. Beforehand Lucie preferred to skip breakfast, opting for ready meals and sandwiches at lunch time, and making large portions for dinner to make up for hunger. She also regularly snacked on large chocolate bars and enjoyed a casual beer, with no understanding of the nutritional value of any of her food. Lucie had previously tried dferent diets that involved cutting calories and weight loss shakes, but nothing worked.    Now, thanks to the fitness plan, Lucie has a better understanding or portion sizes and nutrition in the food she eats. She said: Iaposm also taking more time to make my own food, prepping meals, avoiding alcohol. You have to find a balance, because it is a whole lestyle not a restrictive diet. Lucie now enjoys a breakfast of avocado, eggs, spinach and fruit. She sticks to lean meat and white fish for protein alongside green vegetables, pasta or rice for home cooked meals, but says she still enjoys the occasional meal out with a glass of wine.    You cannot starve yourself, you need to always have stuff to eat, snacks like fruit and nuts. Iaposm a completely dferent person, she added. I go to sleep early, I swim and run twice a week, and Iaposve signed up to do my first Robin Hood half marathon in September. Before, all I wanted to do was sit on the sofa and watch TV but now I just want to move. When I dance at salsa now I feel confident and beautul and instead of waiting at the side, Iaposm the one asking guys to dance.    With all the good tips I know now I know I will never put it back on. Friends and colleagues have been impressed by Lucieaposs dramatic transformation and she has since met a new partner, who she says she feels confident enough to go swimming with. I was saying I was fine before, but I wasnapost, she added. It was the right time and the right people, and getting the right education for a healthy le.You can visit Lucieaposs fundraising page for her half marathon here ."},{"url":null,"title":"man whose partner squeezed testicles","story":"NewsMan whose partner squeezed his testicles until they bled says he still loves herKatie Lee Pitchford attacked Tyler Sweeney with a brush and squeezed his testicles after a row at their home in Miami, FloridaShareByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUN NewsTyler Sweeney has accused his girlfriend Katie Lee Pitchford of trying to tear off his testicles \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn amateur boxer whose girlfriend allegedly tried to rip off his testicles during a -minute attack insists he still loves her.

Speaking in Italy for the first time since being freed,  the -year-old detailed what it felt like to be ly accused for the murder of Meredith Kercher back in . Addressing the Trial By Media  in Modena, Knox sobbed as she described how her family was only allowed to visit her in custody for no more than six one-hour sessions a month. At  years old I was a happy and a lively girl and I was forced to spend my th year imprisoned in an inhumane, unhealthy and unpredictable environment. Instead of dreaming about a career or a family, I contemplated suicide.  Knox, who spent almost four years in prison after being accused of the Perugia murder, said she would try to keep it together when she saw her family. But said there was one time her father visited and the exhaustion, fear and uncertainty had the better of her. I started sobbing and my dad hugged me, holding me tight. I begged him to save me evenI knew that he was as powerless as I was and he had to tell me what my lawyers told him: aposthat probably it would be years before I had another chance at freedom.    And then he started crying and it was then that I realised how serious the situation was because I never saw my father cry in my whole le. She described how her family had their lives torn apart due to the eight-year trial, and how her parents had to take loans out and dip into their pension savings to pay for her legal costs. Knox, who was acquitted during an appeal case by Italyaposs Supreme Court, accused Italian authorities of stripping her of a right to defence and interpreter when they first arrested her. She former foreign exchange student said she underwent a gruelling  hours of questioning during the five days she was taken into custody prior to her formal arrest. And that while speaking close to no Italian at the time and with no legal representatives.  Knox said police were under pressure to make an arrest over the tragic death of her friend, and proceeded to charge her despite having no real proof of her guiltiness. Police thought I was lying when I said time and time again I didnapost murder Meredith, Knox said. But the more she denied the killing, the more they tried to pressure her into thinking she had suppressed memories of the crime. Knox, who following her acquittal in  went on to write her best-seller memoir aposWaiting to be Heardapos, said she was declared innocent, but I know I will always be linked to the tragic death of my friend. The ex-University of Washington student said was portrayed on the global scene as cunning, psychopath, drugged, whore, guilty, merely because it was the simplest thing to believe. Knox said when she ed to her hometown of Seattle she felt lonely, asno one could ever understand what I went through. Her mother then brought her to an Innocence Project conference full of people who had spent time in prison for crimes they didnapost commit. We had little in common besides this, we all knew what it meant to be innocent but treated like we were guilty. They told me: aposHere you are safe little sister, you donapost have to explain anything.apos Rudy Guede is serving a -year sentence for the murder of Meredith after his fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"show us your mojo","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDon#t miss out on your chance to play on MOJO#s unique live stage on October  in Ardfern.Bands have only three weeks left to enter their demo on to MOJO organisers, so don#t delay to be part of this exclusive night of original live music.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert.

Help offered by TSI might involve governance, fundraising and managing volunteers.With the closing of two TSI projects, the Guided Self-Help project and the Self-Directed Supporton September  last year, TSI has shted its approach to dealing with charities and vulnerable people.In a move that has seen six members of staff made redundant across Argyll and Bute and offices closing in Oban and, most recently, Lochgilphead, TSI has been criticised for taking staff #off the front line#.In a statement, TSI chief executive Kirsteen Murray said: #All staff affected by potential redundancy in the over-staffed areas were offered the opportunity to apply for vacant posts within the project.#Unfortunately we said goodbye to one full-time member of staff and two part-time at the end of September .#TSI has introduced a central telephone number and email address, a   self-serve facility on its website and travelling surgeries with  surgeries planned in Argyll and Bute across .Kirsteen Murray continued: #The feedback we have had has been excellent. Small numbers of organisations are accessing the self-serve facility and giving us positive feedback. Similarly, surgeries have proved popular in rural areas where small organisations appreciate us travelling to them.#Lochgilphead charities, though, have either not been informed of the change or claim the service is inadequate.Sandra Johnston, chairperson of four Mid Argyll charitable groups and a committee member of another three, said she had not been informed of the new phone line or website. She added: #The point of the TSI is to support local groups, which isn#t happening.#With them keeping on one member of staff in Lochgilphead # without any phone or office -there are no people to support the groups. The hands-on practical support isn#t there. It#s a very bad situation.##They have told me nothing. Between seven groups, I#ve not heard anything.#Common sense would tell them to send out letters to all the local groups. But they don#t understand who they#re working with. I#m lucky because I have people around me who can use a computer, some people don#t.#Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand said: #It is disappointing and concerning that TSI has closed its office in Lochgilphead, particularly when government legislation is becoming ever more dependent on TSI to provide services.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rally set to be classic","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Argyll Rally s for the third successive year on June , with fresh challenges for competitors in the KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championship.Backed by Dunoon Presents, the event will see some of the best drivers in Scotland and beyond heading to Cowal for classic Argyll forest stages # and  a new test for .On Friday June , pre-event scrutiny will take place at Dunoon Stadium from pm.Eight stages offering  miles of competitive driving will test crews, with a new Gairletter complex adding to the classic tests such as Bishops Glen, Glenbranter and Coire Ealt.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"the-15-best-places-in-scotland-to-have-a-picnic","story":". Loch Lubnaig, CallanderCallander, StirlingMeaning lsquocrookedrsquo in Gaelic, Loch Lubnaig is a far cry from the wide expanses of Loch Lomond or Loch Ness. But its narrow, weaving shape makes for a spectacular view from its banks, as the hills rise steeply ahead of you and peek around the corners of the horizon. There are plenty of flat, pebbly lochside beaches to plonk yourself down on, as well as dedicated picnic spots and the excellent Cabin Cafeacuteyou donrsquot want to bring your own food. And, along with admiring the scenery, you are also likely to see some hardy wild swimmers braving the water ndash no matter what time of year you visit.. Otterrsquos Pool, GallowayRaiderrsquos Road Forest Drive, Galloway Forest Park, Dumfries and GallowayOtterrsquos Pool almost looks made for picnics. The gently bubbling burn runs over rocks to pool in a charming forest clearing, with plenty of picnic tables dotted around to sit at and take in the surroundings. To get there, go halfway along the Raiderrsquos Road Forest Drive, a -mile woodland route that shows off some of the best wildle that Galloway has to offer.. Glenfinnan Viaduct Viewing Point, HighlandsGlenfinnan, Lochaber, HighlandsThe Glenfinnan Viaduct is recognisable the world over, thanks to the Harry Potter scene where the Hogwarts Express passes over its majestic arches. It makes a beautul spot for a picnic, with several dferent viewpoints that can be accessed from the visitor centre. ScotRail trains pass reasonably frequently on the route to Fort William, butyou want to see the iconic Jacobite steam train then you will have to time your picnic carefully as it only passes twice a day.. Conic Hill, BalmahaBalmaha, StirlingTherersquos nothing quite like the smug pleasure of tucking into a well-earned meal after exercise. And where better to do it than with a picnic at the top of Conic Hill  The summit of this steep, short peak offers some pretty spectacular views over Loch Lomond, and is the perfect place to just do nothing except soak in the scenery. The climb does require a bit of stamina, but it should be suitable for most ages and fitness levels.. Portencross, AyrshirePortencross, North AyrshireTroon and Prestwick might get most of the visitors, but those in the know would tell you that it is the clachan of Portencross that offers the best views in Ayrshire. Its proximity to Arran means it has an unrivalled outlook over the sea to the island ndash which looks particularly majestic as the sun is going down. You can head to one of the picnic tables dotted along the Portencross front, or to its small beach, but arguably the best place to base yourself is on the end of the pier.. Cambus OrsquoMay, AberdeenshireBallater, AberdeenshireThe erse, rich forest of Cambus OrsquoMay offers plenty of iety for visitors. You can picnic in the dense woodlandsyou want to get away from it all, in the open heather fieldsyou want a view of the Cairngorms, or at one of the riverside picnic benchesyou want to admire its suspension bridge. It was damaged in Storm Frank and is no longer safe to cross, but the -year-old bridge is still lovely to admire. Especially with a tasty picnic.. Botanic Gardens, Glasgow Great Western Road, GlasgowA bit of an institution among west-enders, the Botanic Gardens is an excellent place to unwind with a picnic on a sunny day. Any spot you choose is likely to be surrounded by beautul flowers, with the gardens hosting  specimens that come from more than  plant families. When you finish, make sure to have a wander around the striking Kibble Palace or the Kelvin riverside path to explore more of Glasgowrsquos greenery.. St Cyrus Beach, near MontroseMontrose, AngusThis three-mile-long beach, which is part of the St Cyrus Nature Reserve, has plenty of lovely spots for relaxing on a sunny day. You can get to it from the clf path or the visitor centre, where there is adjoining nature reserve to do some pre-picnic birdwatching. On the beach itself make sure to look out for seals, dolphins and killer whales, which have all been spotted offshore.. The Meadows, EdinburghOld Town, Edinburgh city centreIf you want a quiet, secluded picnic then the Meadows isnrsquot for you. But what it lacks in space it more than makes up for in people watching: with buskers, fitness fanatics, families and students all using the grassy fields for an escape from city le. Just be vigilant that you donrsquot have your food stolen by an over-friendly dog, or get hit by a stray frisbee from one of the many games that get played on the Meadows.. Fairy Pools, SkyeGlenbrittle, SkyeNot only was it named as Scotlandrsquos best picnic spot in , but Skyersquos Fairy Pools even made it on to the prestigious Lonely Planet list of the top  natural wonders of the world. If you want to see them for yourself, drive to the Forestry Commission car park of Glumagan Na Sithichean and then hike along the path for about  minutes until you reach the first of the waterfalls.

With its walled garden, perfectly manicured yew hedges and the backdrop of a th century castle, it makes for a pretty grand setting for sitting back and enjoying a sandwich. Be sure to leave time to explore the castle ndash and its beautul paintings ndash once you are finished.. Tentsmuir Forest, FeLeuchars, FeWith woodland, sand dunes and a beach, Tentsmuir has plenty of options for those looking to eat alfresco. There are dedicated picnic tables near the car park, but you can also follow one of the designated trails to find the perfect spot to set up camp. Look out for red squirrels, sea birds and dragonflies ndash and maybe even some seals basking on the beach.. Pollok Country Park, Glasgow Pollokshaws Road, GlasgowTo picnic alongside Highland cattle you might think that you have to travel to the countryside. But despite being right in the middle of Glasgowrsquos bustling south side, Pollok Park has its very own herd of Highland cows, along with plenty of open space and woodland. A great place to enjoy a picnic in peace.. Oldshoremore Beach, SutherlandKinlochbervie, SutherlandIf you want a picnic in peace, you canrsquot do much better than Oldshoremore beach. Along with its sister beach Phollain ndash the two are separated by a rocky isle known as Eilean na h-Aiteig ndash the south-facing bays of Oldshoremore can feel like your own private paradise.

Thatrsquos why I think itrsquos important that people in the public eye come out, especially when these people are role models. Others will see that being gay is not something that is abnormal.

The cover in question is that of Nite Le During Wartime: Edinburgh and beyond -. This second of photographer and writer Innes Reekiersquos occasional series of pocket-sized photo-books is launched in an edition published by Jeremy Thomsrsquo Stereogram imprint at the capitalrsquos Stills photography gallery next week.Reekiersquos previous volume, Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn: The Birthday Party and beyond -, also published by Stereogram, focused on Nick Caversquos former band captured on a trip to Edinburgh. The follow-up, the Talking Heads referencing Nite Le During Wartime, immortalises a moment during roughly the same period when Edinburgh was brought to le by its own characters.ldquoI have such great memories of the old days in Edinburgh, says the now London-based Lahbib. ldquoI was there the other day, and me and a friend had a wander around, and reminisced about the flats wersquod shared and the places we went to, and all the second-hand shops. All the clothes Irsquom wearing in the pictures in the book are second-hand, partly because thatrsquos all we could afford, but partly because everything then was about being original, and being creative.Also featured in Nite Le During Wartime are images of dancer and choreographer Michael Clark during the Edinburgh International Festival run of his ballet, I Am Curious Orange, featuring The Fall. There are shots too of Edinburgh post-punk irregulars such as Boots for Dancing, Fini Tribe and So You Think Yoursquore a Cowboy, as well as poet Paul Reekie.ldquoIt was the height of Thatcherrsquos Britain, says Lahbib, ldquoand itrsquos really interesting that in the picture Irsquom standing next to the sign, because as Irsquove got older, saving the NHS is one of the things Irsquove become passionate about. So even though I probably wasnrsquot that politically aware at the time, itrsquos had an effect.Lahbib originally trained as a dancer, and spent four years at ballet school. By the time the image adorning the cover of Nite Le During Wartime was taken, she had made her onscreen debut in the title role of Cary Parkerrsquos piece of big-screen s Glasgow whimsy, The Girl in the Picture. Although the part was small, it gave her the taste for something more.Rather than capitalise on her film experience straight away, Lahbib decided to learn her craft, and studied drama at Queen Margaret College in Edinburgh. Early stage work included Wildcatrsquos production of Oh, What a Lovely War, with stints on Taggart before she moved to London. Once there, she was cast as a regular in long-running London TV soap, London Bridge. From there she moved into cop show Thief Takers before appearing alongside Forbes Masson and Stephen McCole in Skins creator Brian Elsleyrsquos mini-series, The Young Personrsquos Guide to Being a Rock Star.Lahbib moved into the mainstream by way of three series of Bad Girls, before joining Monarch of the Glen and appearing opposite Robson Green in Wire in the Blood. Lahbib also ran a performing school for young people. This led to her founding a childrenrsquosrsquo acting agency after one of her charges, Dylan McKiernan, was cast in Ken Loachrsquos film, I, Daniel Blake. Lahbibrsquos now thirteen-year-old daughter, Skye, meanwhile, has appeared in several seriesrsquo of Grantchester, playing her mumrsquos former co-star Robson Greenrsquos daughter. Lahbib also co-runs her own producing house, Contro Vento, with her husband, actor Raffaella Degruttola, with several films under their belt.Now back acting and producing full time, for Lahbib, Nite Le During Wartime is a step into a time when she and her generation were on the cusp of making it.ldquoGoing round all my old haunts and seeing Innesrsquo pictures has taken me back, she says. ldquoThere were all these people having fun, having adventures and doing these creative things that were about to take off.

Over there in the corner, he says, is the alpha male, and that pigeon on the perch by the window is the stray whorsquos wondered in from somewhere . There are also some new birds, imported from Belgium that were sent over as chicks and have settled in well. Their claws clatter on the wood and they settle down again. Therersquos about  of them in all.The obvious question to ask Donny and his we Linda, whorsquos also a pigeon enthusiast, is: why do they love these birds so much  And therersquos a second obvious question: why do so many people hate pigeons with just as much passion  Another striking trend has been seen in recent years: a hobby, pigeon keeping, that was once one of the most popular in the country has declined precipitously. There were once a quarter of a million pigeon fanciers in Britain now there are some ,yoursquore lucky. Still a large number, but not a patch on what it was.: great places to enjoy Scotlands peerless wildleDonny and Linda Brooks have seen the change for themselves at their home in Wishaw. They point out of the loft across the line of houses on their street. There used to be a pigeon loft in virtually every garden, says Linda, but now therersquos just theirs. Donny says it was the same in Cumbusnethan, the nearby mining village where he grew up. ldquoA lot of the miners had pigeons, he says. ldquoIt was a working manrsquos sport but now there is an anti-pigeon mood. The phrase lsquoflying ratsrsquo stuck.So maybe itrsquos time to ditch that terrible phrase, flying rats, and replace it with something  that reflects the true, remarkable nature of pigeons. Linda says any animal can be a nuisancetheyrsquore in the ldquowrong place, but she sees the gentle joy of them every day. ldquoI miss them when theyrsquore not at the back door, she says, ldquobecause theyrsquore communicators. They talk to each other. You can hear them having their wee conversations.Another pigeon fancier who feels the same way is the writer Jon Day. Jon has just written a book about pigeons, Homing, which follows his efforts to establish a loft and breed racers, but he also explores the extraordinary and often mysterious qualities of the birds. They are miniature jump jets, he says, capable of accelerating from - miles per hour in under two seconds, but they are also just as intelligent as great apes, dolphins and elephants. But whatrsquos really fascinating is how they find their way home.ldquoItrsquos an enduring and controversial biological mystery, says Jon when I call him at his home in east London. ldquoMost of the consensus seems to be that itrsquos essentially a suite of dferent and fairly mysterious navigational senses that we may or may not possess.ldquoTherersquos certainly a lot of evidence that pigeons can detect the earthrsquos magnetic field, but they need to be able to smell in order to find their way home from an unfamiliar place and whatrsquos so amazing and beautul about that is not that theyrsquore smelling their way home ndash as we might with the smell of bacon through the house ndash itrsquos that the winds, when they blow from dferent directions, bring with them the sense of a base note and the pigeons can use the changing intensities of those base odours to work out where they have been taken in relation to their loft. Lots of the racers I meet have a sense of wonder and amazement at that fact ndash that this tiny, g creature can perform such impossible and mysterious actions.However, like Donny and Linda Brooks, Jon Day feels that a prejudice has built up against pigeons in recent years. Partly, he says, itrsquos because we have become much more house proud and people are less willing to tolerate their neighbours having pigeon lofts in their gardens. Keeping pigeons also requires a big commitment ndash itrsquos expensive but you do have to be at home quite a lot of the time to let them in and out of the loft. So, in many ways, keeping pigeons just isnrsquot compatible with modern le.Jon thinks therersquos something  going on as well ndash something more profound: some people love pigeons, and some people hate them because theyrsquore a bit like us. ldquoPigeons seem to mimic human behaviour, he says, ldquoso the place where they grow up generally becomes their home for the rest of their lives and they have this very human, it seems to me, relationship with a place. But theyrsquore also these kind of opportunistic, parasitic creatures that live in our spaces and environment and thatrsquos one of the reasons theyrsquore reviled. They remind us slightly of ourselves.Jon also thinks that what humans can see in pigeons helps explain why the popularity of racing pigeons has declined. In the early part of the th century, the birds were a vital form of communication and carrying messages from the battlefields made them heroes during the First and Second World War. However, Jon believes that, for the working class men that made up most of the pigeon racing community, their birds used to offer a kind of imaginative travelling that they couldnrsquot do in reality. Then air fares became more affordable and the pigeon fanciers could travel for themselves. They didnrsquot need their birds to do it for them and so slowly the lofts were shut up.: great places to enjoy Scotlands peerless wildleJon, and Donny and Linda Brooks, have all felt this sense of vicarious freedom in caring for their birds. Jon speaks about the joy of sitting in his garden in east London with a cup of tea and watching his birds flying overhead all the way through his book he also takes an imaginative flight with the birds, following their mysterious instincts as they race from Thurso in the far north to Leyton in the far south:  hours,  miles, their wings beating three times a second, their homing beacon taking them home.This freedom the birds have is important to every fancier, especially because there are some people who think keeping pigeons is cruel. In his book, Jon describes the methods some fanciers will use to win races ndash culling birds that havenrsquot performed well during the season, for instance. Donny Brooks also admits that there are some ruthless keepers out there. Not only that, the birds are at risk from predators in the air and on the ground and Linda Brooks tells me that, in any one year, they will lose a third to a half of their flock this way.When I ask him about it, Jon Day says that, in the end, he wasnrsquot prepared to use any of the tougher methods on his birds, but both he and Linda and Donny Brooks vehemently deny that pigeon keeping is cruel. ldquoWhen you open the loft, says Donny, ldquoitrsquos up to the bird whether it wants to go out or not and when it goes out,it wants to stay out, thatrsquos it. Yoursquore rearing a creature that wants to stay with you yoursquore its home and its keeper. In order to make a pigeon want to come home, you have to create a home that it wants to come back to.Jon agrees with this. ldquoI thought a lot about the ethics of the sport as I am a meat eater and a fisherman, he says. ldquoBut pigeons are free to do what they like when theyrsquore liberated so although I can see that people have objected to the sport, whatrsquos really being celebrated is a relationship that would otherwise die out and I donrsquot think itrsquos cruel. It has risks, as does horse racing and dog racing, and I suppose people who object to animal human interactions as being inherently exploitative might well have things to say about that. But every time you open the loft, the pigeons are free to leave and go away.Jon also believes that the men and women who love pigeon racing ndash mostly men, it has to be said ndash are reminding us not to take the species for granted. We might grumble about them now and complain about their mess and put up spikes to deter them or string that gets tangled round their feet, but shouldnrsquot we stop this stupid and cruel behaviour  Pigeons might not always be here.ldquoIrsquom conscious of the fact that these things look as though they are constants but that might not be true and we should step back, says Jon. ldquoPassenger pigeons were this hugely populous species of pigeon, mainly in north America. Up until the th century, there were flocks of up to a million but within a couple of decades they were wiped out by hunting. And they had a similar reputation in the public imagination as the feral pigeon.What Jon hopes is that, in time, we can rehabilitate the reputation of all pigeons and see them as their admirers do. As a survivor, like humans. As an almost perfect example of natural design. As a remarkable little jump jet that can hit  miles per hour in two seconds.ldquoIrsquom quite struck by the ferocity of anti-pigeon sentiment, among not just urban dwellers, says Jon, ldquobut often among people who love birds who see them as a devastating mono-culture who come and dominate. Jon believes, though, that there are ways we can learn to live together better and cites experiments in some European cities where large lofts have been built to encourage the pigeons to nest where they will not be a nuisance.ldquoOne of the reasons feral pigeons have been so successful in an urban context, he says, ldquois the fact they see our homes as their homes.

But a speech like Ms Sturgeonrsquos is a good opportunity to hear what a leader says theyrsquore thinking, as well as a chance to work out what theyrsquore actually doing. Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech was promoted in advance as a statement of support for EU membership and shared European values. Therersquos the V word again.However, there are several problems with the concept of values in politics ndash all of which were on display in Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech. The first is the definition: what on earth does ldquoScottish values mean  But more worrying is what happens when you promote one set of values over another. By definition,ldquoour values exist then so must ldquotheir values in other words, while purporting to promote similarity, the V word actually emphasises the dference. It isnrsquot a kind of glue, itrsquos a wedge.: Nicola Sturgeon calls Jeremy Hunt childish and pathetic after Brussels snubSo, did we get an indication from Ms Sturgeon about what she thinks ldquoScottish values means  Well, there was some talk about fairness and internationalism, but the First Minister might as well have said that Scotlandrsquos values were all kinds of everything: sailboats and fishermen, wishing wells and wedding bells. That, at least, would have been closer to the truth because when many people talk about Scottish values, what they really seem to be talking about is symbols: hills and glens and flags.The idea that Scottish people have ldquovalues also fails to understand how a country ndash or humanity for that matter ndash works. I was brought up in a family of four, in the same way, in the same country, but my siblings and I have dferent views on most issues ndash in other words, we have dferent ldquovalues and the same dferences occur outside of families. I share some ideas with some Scots, but I self-evidently donrsquot with others. My Scottishness, and your Scottishness, is irrelevant.If you donrsquot believe me, I challenge you to tell me what Scotlandrsquos values are. Perhaps itrsquos a sense that we should all be equal, but,so, in what way is believing in equality uniquely Scottish  And the truth is many Scots do not believe in equality ndash those opposed to gay marriage for example. Or perhaps you think our supposed openness to immigration is a Scottish value, but why, in that case, did so many Scots vote for Brexit  In fact, Brexit is not an English value just as pro-Europeanism is not a Scottish value and to say anything  is political vulgarity.And yet Ms Sturgeon appears to believe Scottish values do exist and therersquos a good reason for that. Nationalists, of the Brexit and Scottish iety, like to talk about values because they like to promote the idea of national identity. This can then be used to justy referendums or independence on the basis that ldquoour values are incompatible with the UK Governmentor the European Union . To do anything , and acknowledge similarities rather than dferences, undermines the case for separateness.This is exactly what Ms Sturgeon was up to in her speech and it happened again on Thursday when it was announced that Boris Johnson had topped the Tory leadership vote and the SNP reacted by publishing a mock ballot paper showing a choice between Mr Johnson and independence. No doubt, the First Minister would also say Mr Johnson is contrary to ldquoScotlandrsquos values when, in fact, Brexit is merely a policy and Mr Johnson a politician, just as independence and Ms Sturgeon are, and it can all be changed. Scotland and the UK donrsquot have values, we have governments with policies that will be superseded by governments with dferent policies.:UK Government to get first lsquoCabinet Roomrsquo in EdinburghAnd donrsquot we also have to ask where the concept of national values might take us next  A few years ago, Michael Govedecreed that ldquoBritish values should be taught in English schools, and who was to define those values do you think  Mr Gove, of course, because thatrsquos what happens with values ndash they are always defined by politicians, usually nationalistic ones, rather than parliament or the public. Values are an instrument of nationalism and of the state.Scottish nationalists would argue, of course, that they are dferent, that their values are civic rather than nationalistic, but itrsquos easy to imagine the future government of an independent Scotland insisting on Scottish values being taught in classrooms in the way Mr Gove did with British values. Indeed, I think some nationalists might insist on it to weed out unionists at an early age.Sadly, I can also imagine a Scottish government insisting on the teaching of national pride, another of the consequences of value politics. In her speech in Brussels, Ms Sturgeon spoke about pride in being a European, and perhaps some Scots would say pride in being Scottish should be one of our values too. But shouldnrsquot we be proud of the things we achieve rather than the things we are  To be proud of a fact you cannot change is fatuous. In fact, I think I can say that is one of my rules for le. It is one of my values."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9989436.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-question-time-viewers-praise-speech-from-francesca-martinez","story":"The -year-old, who has cerebral palsy,slammed thegovernment for having \"blood on its hands\" during an impassioned two-minute speech on the show.:BBC Question Time criticised over balance as  show visits ElginShe also hit out at the Conservative Government and Boris Johnson overcuts to disability benefits, describing them as absolutely outrageous.In her speech, she said: \"The biggest reason I am not a fan of Boris is he has backed austerity policies, again and again.\"Austerity has caused the death of , human beings in Britain.

representation on safeguarding decision-making bodies.It also recommends further refining safeguarding audits, which should be independently scrutinised, and having a national training plan on the issue.The report states: ldquoThe Bishoprsquos Conference of Scotland should give detailed and urgent consideration to the creation of a strengthened, resourced and independent SCSS with appropriate professional support as a crucial step to promote transparency and restore credibility.It continues: ldquoMuch still needs to be done to ensure victims of abuse are seen, heard and supported by the church and the process of healing begins to take place.ldquoImprovement in policy and openness to learning from the audit process will start to sht culture.ldquoHowever, investment is required to develop a properly resourced professional safeguarding service.ldquoCommitment to create a dedicated, independent safeguarding service which supports the development needs of the eight dioceses drives consistency is empowered to independently investigate concerns or complaints and can act without bias in all its affairs is critical to rebuilding trust with congregations and the general public.Group chairwoman Baroness Helen Liddell said: ldquoThe problem of how the church is perceived is a universal one and signals the need for real and far-reaching change.ldquoThe vigour with which change is brought about, and is seen to be brought about, will determine whether credibility and trust can ever be restored.ldquoThere needs to be a change in culture, in capacity, in capability and that needs training, learning, reflection, the utmost transparency, and it needs leadership.ldquoWe have found a willingness to adopt that change, but true progress can only come about as a result of deep analysis of strengths and weaknesses.Bishop Joseph Toal, who oversees the SCSS, welcomed the report and said it would be given ldquoserious consideration.He added: ldquoSince setting up the Independent Review Group, we have taken steps to improve safeguarding practices in all eight dioceses in Scotland.These include publishing a manual of safeguarding procedures, revising the annual safeguarding audit carried out in all Catholic parishes and having independent audits of safeguarding practices in two dioceses, which will be extended to all.Bishop Toal said: ldquoWe are determined to apply what we learn, both from the steps we have already taken and from the IRGrsquos report, and to ensure that the highest standards of safeguarding practice are met throughout the Church in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"people-take-to-streets-of-oban-in-all-under-one-banner-march-in-support-of-scottish-independence","story":"It is the third march this year organised by pro-indy group

volunteers make across Aberdeenshire communities.Volunteers’ Week, held from June  to , aims to celebrate and say thank you to volunteers across the UK for their contributions.Inverurie Day Centre volunteersIn Aberdeenshire’s towns, villages and rural areas volunteers help to provide many important, often vital, services, facilities and opportunities for local people of all ages.As the Third Sector Interface in Aberdeenshire, AVA provides support and guidance across the area to people who are interested in volunteering as well as organisations with volunteers. AVA is a one-stop-shop for all things volunteering and its Development Officers work right across theand breadth of Aberdeenshire.Keith Anderson, AVA Head of Development said: “Helping volunteering to happen is a key part of our work and an area that we all enjoy. We are always amazed at people’s generosity with their time and that willingness to be there for others makes such a dference.”During this year’s Volunteer Week AVA celebrated Margaret Murison for over  years of volunteering in Balmedie.Margaret was honoured as an outstanding volunteer in May with a presentation by AVA at The Friendship Club within Eigie House in Balmedie, where Margaret volunteers.Well-wishers, friends and family all wanted to be in on the surprise presentation for Margaret – but once word sneaked out the lounge was soon filled to capacity as everyone descended on Eigie House to see Margaret receive her award.The event was organised by Rosie Nicol from Belhelvie Community Trust, who spoke about her dedication to some special projects in the district, including The Beach Wheelchairs and The Sand Bothy. Margaret used to work in the bank for many years so generally gets asked to deal with many of the financial elements of the organisations she helps.She is also an invaluable source of expertise on family history locally, enjoys her garden and volunteering with the Church which is very close to her heart.AVA Development Officer, Lorna Sandison said: “I am delighted to be included in on-going and new projects in the Balmedie area as it is such a motivated and connected community where lessons can be learned as to how communities should indeed interact. Huge congratulations to Margaret who has contributed so much to the area – she is an inspiration to many”.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aaron Bisset impressed industry professionals at Glasgow performance\"  Rothienorman actor signed by talent agency viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"AVA also celebrated the volunteers providing vital support services at Inverurie Day Centre.The centre is is available for older people, aged  or over and people with disabilities who enjoy social contact, but are less able to get out and about, or need support to manage day to day tasks.The Day Centre has a fantastic team of eight dedicated volunteers who supportDay Care Organisers Maggie McRitchie and Mo Ritchie to deliver activities for the service users throughout the day.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"explorer scouts raise over 1k at fun dog show event","story":"The Daviot and Oldmeldrum Explorer Scouts kicked off fundraising for their second trip to volunteer at a school in Uganda at the weekend.The group held their annual Fun Dog Show in Oldmeldrum on Sunday, June .The event raised around £,.At the Fun Dog Show there was a choice of ten classes and over  dogs took part.The DOM Explorer Scouts ran a tea and cake tent whilst a number of local pet-related businesses had stalls.The Scratch Club from Inverurie ran Flyball demonstations and also let people try with their own dogs.The DOM Explorer Scouts were supported by a number of local businesses who sponsored the event.They hope to hold the next Fun Dog Show on Sunday, June  .In July  the DOM Explorer Scouts visited Ruhanga in SW Uganda to help finish building a School  Scout Hall that they had funded.

Famed for his pace and strength, you couldn’t find a better poster boy for a stereotypical view of modern masculinity. He’s world class, at the top of his game with  caps for his country, a two-time British and Irish Lion and twice Six Nations Player of the Championship. But there’s also a softer side to this alpha male, and back home in Hawick, as he talks about his children, losing his best friend and his pride in his home town, he’s not afraid to let his emotions show. It’s easy to see why he’s a face of Dove Men+Care, the skincare brand’s global initiative to promote men as non-violent fathers and caregivers, celebrating a definition of strength with care at its core. “Whatever you see on the pitch, everybody’s got a soft heart,” says Hogg. “Andnot, you’re doing something wrong.”Known as a bag-of-tricks player who can create tries and passes from nowhere, Hogg has a magic that saw JK Rowling bestowing wizard status on him in a Tweet. With the skills of a stand-off when required, the -year-old fullback is best in the back three and, with Finn Russell, is one of the talismans of the Scottish side. Hogg has just come to the end of a nine-year stint at Glasgow Warriors and is bound for Exeter Chiefs this summer. In the meantime he’s having a few weeks’ well-earned break at home, swapping hitch-kicks for kickback.With pre-season training, games for his country against France and Georgia and the Rugby World Cup in Japan ahead, he has his hands full on the pitch. And off too, because the fullback is a big family man and this Father’s Day Archie, three and a half, Olivia, two, and six-month-old George will be keeping him on the run. Never mind Leinster in the Guinness PRO final or the auld enemy at Twickenham, the mini Hogg squad have every bit as much bounce as one of their dad’s drop kicks. “The big thing is routine and preparation,” he says.Ah yes, that’s key with children. Oh wait, he’s talking about rugby.“Yeah, as soon as you get that spot-on in terms of training and schedules, you’re half-way to success and the big thing is getting a routine that includes the kids too. They balance off each other really well and it works for both. “The only thing I maybe struggle with is on match days when I’m trying to concentrate on the game ahead and there’s a job with the kids to do. But we’ve been working on that,” he says. “We’re not going to get everything perfect, and things are not always going to run smoothly,” he laughs. “But as long as the kids are happy and I’m performing, that’s all I can ask for.”“We” is Hogg and his we Gillian, also a Hawick native. The pair have been married for three years, and together for seven, after Hogg persuaded the daughter of family friends to date him. “We eventually got together,” he says. “After a few months of chasing her, she eventually caved in, thankfully, and we’ve been together ever since.”Chasing her  She must be fastshe can out-run Hogg He laughs. “It was more just not replying to my messages!”But persistence is another Hogg quality, as is resilience, something he’s shown in coming back after injuries to his shoulder and ankle, not to mention shrugging off concussion in his last match with the Warriors, where he was carried off the pitch with  minutes to go. “That was a bit disappointing when you’re in touching distance of winning, but look, it’s happened now, and I’ve just got to get on with my job.”Getting on with the job means the move to Exeter this summer, and leaving the town where he grew up, steeped in the rugby tradition.“It was time for me to move on and challenge myself outwith Scottish rugby and the timing was spot on for Gill and the kids. As a family we’re excited because we’ve always wanted to experience new things and challenge ourselves in dferent environments. I don’t look too far ahead, but when I come to the end of my career, I want to turn round and say, ‘I’m glad I tried that’ as opposed to, ‘I wish I’d tried that.’Hawick will always be home for us, and it will be dficult to leave, tough moving further afield. In terms of leaving Scottish rugby, I’ll be forever grateful for the opportunity to become a professional and live the le I’m living. And it’s about learning new things to bring back to Scotland and try to improve the national game as well – we’re in a good place now and hopefully we’re going to continue to rise. It’s exciting times for Scotland, and me.”At this stage in his career and with a young family is it time for Hogg to cash in anyway  “No, If we were interested in the financial side of the game we’d be going to France, but that disnae really excite me,” he says.Speaking of exciting times for Scotland, with the Rugby World Cup coming up in Japan in September, as one of the team’s poster boys Hogg appears a shoo-in to be in the squad. But he’s not taking his place on the plane for granted. “There’s a long old pre-season to go through first,” he says, “and a huge amount of competition for places. There’s no bigger tournament in world rugby, so here’s hoping I can get out there and try and achieve something special. We start off with Ireland. We’ve shown we can beat them, so here’s hoping we can perform on the day.”Hogg is big on the cameraderie of the game, on and off the pitch, and emphasises the importance of bonding to how a team plays. “That’s a big part of rugby culture. You work incredibly hard but you enjoy each other’s company after the game – and enjoy a couple of quiet beers,” he says. And certainly, his focus for Japan is all about the training and games, not the down time.So he won’t be hogging the mic in the karaoke bars He laughs. “Thankfully I’m one of the more experienced boys in the team nowadays and you don’t necessarily have to sing all the time. It’s mainly bullying the younger boys into entertaining us,” he jokes. “But,ever asked upon to sing, I have a few so I’ll… butcher a song and get booed.”For Hogg it was always going to be rugby, born into a rugby family and raised in a town famous for rugby – although technically he was born in Melrose at Borders General Hospital – “brought back to Hawick as quick as we possibly could,” he is keen to point out. After a rugby course at Borders College he joined Glasgow and went through their Academy, turning pro at . His dad John played for Hawick, coached and refereed professionally and his brother Graham also played the game.“It was Graham who gave me the ambition to become a rugby player after following him for several years,” he says. His mother Margaret has always worked in property, and when his dad wasn’t on the rugby pitch, he was working at Johnstons of Elgin as a knitwear technician, the details of which have been lost on Hogg. “Knitwear technician  I’ve no idea. I worked there too in my first job in the school holidays, packing boxes – that was an eye-opener,” he says and discreetly neglects to say why, adding “and recently I’ve done a clothing line for them, SWH, which I really enjoyed.”It’s through his father that Hogg is distantly related to George Best, something that makes him laugh when it’s raised. “I can never remember the exact relation, but my “dad knows. He always wanted to find out his fa mily history, so he did and we’ve caught up with the Irish family, who are absolutely brilliant.”Does he ever ponder the Best experience of working as a professional sportsman and coping with le in the spotlight “Everybody’s dferent,” he says. “For me it’s about making sure I stay grounded and provide for my family. Rugby’s a short career and you’ve got to try and make the most of it. It’s about learning other things off the field to make the transition from professional sport because you never know when it’s going to end.I’m really interested in property with my mum, and also the punditry side of the game. I love rugby, I love speaking rugby, and I’d love to still be involved in some way. Hopefully I’ll play until I’m about , , but you never know when it’s going to end.”Another clue to Hogg’s caring side can be seen in his signature scoring celebration of forming a “W” with his hands. It’s a tribute to his friend Richard Wilkinson, who was killed when the car in which they were both teenage passengers crashed. “I’ve said all along I’m gonnae take Richard along the journey that I’m living because he could quite easily be in my position and I’ll continue to take him along my career.”The le-changing experience in  also spurred Hogg to become involved with the Road Safety Scotland campaign to cut the number of deaths on rural roads. “We’re trying to make people aware of what’s on country roads andit gets the message across and saves lives, we’re doing our job.”Wilkinson is also represented among the many tattoos with which Hogg’s body is decorated. “I love them,” he says. “I’ve got one on the arm, the kids’ names down the ribs, my best mate’s initials on my ribs, lots of dferent bits and pieces. I’m trying to make it a story of my le and what’s happened to me, something I’m proud of and I’ll continue doing it. They’re agony,” he says, man enough to admit it, “but I love ‘em,” At the top of his game, Hogg can look forward to more career and le highlights to commemorate in ink, and he’s happy to be a role model for the next generation of players. “I think that’s part of being a rugby player. It’s about inspiring the next generation. “I’ll always remember being a little kid and professional rugby players coming to the club and Kelly Brown and Nikki Walker coming to my school. So when people come and speak to me and want signatures, it could be my th, but it might be that person’s first. And that’s something I remember. If you get too big for your boots, especially in a place like Hawick, you’ll get knocked back down pretty quickly. For me it’s about making sure there are players who want to play for Hawick and Scotland, making sure rugby in the future is in the right place. And I take great pride in doing it because I remember being that kid.” Speaking of kids it’s time for Hogg to get back to his, but not before sharing a final comment that sums up his ability to combine his personal and professional le.“The best thing is after the game when they come on the pitch and you get to share those precious moments with them. Those are my favourite times.”When men care, everyone benefits, andHogg’s right and being a good father makes him a better player, it’s a win-win for his family and Scottish rugby.Happy Father’s Day from Dove Men+Care, and their Scottish Rugby ambassador, Stuart Hogg.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Some people dont get it could argue till the cows come home some people are very self opinionated cant tell them whats right or wrong Fully agree with haydnJohan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedsterIm not defending speeding. Im saying this is the safest bit of road we have for overtaking and saying that youcannot possibly know the speed of the other cars without measuring equipment.Engine power is expressed in horsepower and lots of horsepower enables some to be faster than others going up hills than others.Haydn I have driven small cars which feel like they need a push going up our hills, that is all.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case .."},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38188701.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/sponi_48.jpg","title":"nolan only two politicians have been to fantasy island home","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a story in that in itself.“I am saying ‘absolutely not, I am meeting you in public’ [To Mr Bell]. And him saying ‘the story I am about to give you here will be the biggest story you will ever had’.”Nolan did not expand on why McGuinness was at his home.Mr Bell was suspended by the DUP in December  after giving an interview to Nolan about the scheme. He made explosive claims that DUP special advisers were reluctant to introduce cost control tarfs to the scheme.The Renewable Heat Incentive scheme was an green energy initiative set up to encourage businesses in Northern Ireland to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.The so-called “cash-for-ash” scandal exposed the taxpayer to a huge overspend by paying out more in subsidies than the fuel was worth.As a result of the scandal a public inquiry, chaired by Sir Patrick Coghlin, was launched to investigate. The report is expected to be published later this year.The scandal led to McGuinness resigning as deputy first minister and the power-sharing executive has not been restored since."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the church to review the Scottish Catholic Safeguarding Service , saying a strengthened, independent and resourced service is a “crucial step to promote transparency and restore credibility”.The group, set up by the church in  to monitor its response to a major review of safeguarding and child protection, found a good start had been made on implementing the McLellan Commission recommendations but much more needs to be done.In addition to reviewing the safeguarding service, the IRG makes a series of further recommendations in its first report, including on support for abuse survivors.The group wants each diocese to have a clear policy statement on access and support for survivors, an independent person they can approach for advice, and to consider including survivor representation on safeguarding decision-making bodies.It also recommends further refining safeguarding audits, which should be independently scrutinised, and having a national training plan on the issue.The vigour with which change is brought about, and is seen to be brought about, will determine whether credibility and trust can ever be restoredIRG chairwoman Baroness Helen LiddellThe report states: “The Bishop’s Conference of Scotland should give detailed and urgent consideration to the creation of a strengthened, resourced and independent SCSS with appropriate professional support as a crucial step to promote transparency and restore credibility.”It continues: “Much still needs to be done to ensure victims of abuse are seen, heard and supported by the church and the process of healing begins to take place.“Improvement in policy and openness to learning from the audit process will start to sht culture.“However, investment is required to develop a properly resourced professional safeguarding service.“Commitment to create a dedicated, independent safeguarding service which supports the development needs of the eight dioceses drives consistency is empowered to independently investigate concerns or complaints and can act without bias in all its affairs is critical to rebuilding trust with congregations and the general public.”Group chairwoman Baroness Helen Liddell said: “The problem of how the church is perceived is a universal one and signals the need for real and far-reaching change.“The vigour with which change is brought about, and is seen to be brought about, will determine whether credibility and trust can ever be restored.“There needs to be a change in culture, in capacity, in capability and that needs training, learning, reflection, the utmost transparency, and it needs leadership.“We have found a willingness to adopt that change, but true progress can only come about as a result of deep analysis of strengths and weaknesses.”Bishop Joseph Toal, who oversees the SCSS, welcomed the report and said it would be given “serious consideration”.He added: “Since setting up the Independent Review Group, we have taken steps to improve safeguarding practices in all eight dioceses in Scotland.”These include publishing a manual of safeguarding procedures, revising the annual safeguarding audit carried out in all Catholic parishes and having independent audits of safeguarding practices in two dioceses, which will be extended to all.Bishop Toal said: “We are determined to apply what we learn, both from the steps we have already taken and from the IRG’s report, and to ensure that the highest standards of safeguarding practice are met throughout the Church in Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"media built false story around me amanda knox tells italian

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"derry woman appointed managing director global strategy consultancy firm","story":"A Derry woman has been appointed to the role of Managing Director at a leading firm specialising in leadership strategy.Tessa Breslinassumed the role in recent weeks and will now head up YSC’s Americas Division spanning the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.YSC Consulting uses their expertise in behavioural science to help organisations across the globe connect the dots between business strategy and leadership.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17694561.12-man-fermanagh-make-exit-as-missed-chances-prove-costly/resources/images/9983671.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The young kits born in the school enclosures will then be released by NIEA into specially selected sites across Northern Ireland to bolster existing colonies.At the allotmentThe passion of Mr Coleman has inspired the children to such an extent that they have received letters of support and enthusiasm from Sir David Attenborough.The allotments, half of which are for the pupils to grow produce, are also rented by members of the community at a small surcharge and with the proviso that they come and help clean up around the school.Video: Timeline and CCTV of suspected IRA unit on way to attempt to

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
