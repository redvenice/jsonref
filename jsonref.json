Everyone is drunk and riding their horses. Get out of here – it’s too dangerous”’ Here, this horseman has broken away from the pack, but he wasn’t the frontrunner. The horses were racing on a track alongside a road. I don’t know exactly how many participants there were, but there were cars everywhere. Each family wants to drive next to their horse, everyone is beeping their horns, shouting. It is like a car race too, some slowing down, others speeding up, people overtaking on all sides. There’s some crazy driving, and so much dust in the air.I tried to take pictures before they started, but nobody really wanted to speak with me then and everyone was really nervous. When the race began, I took some shots from the ground, but then I jumped into a car and just hoped the photos would work out. I couldn’t really focus on what I was doing – you’re just trying not to have an accident. There were maybe 40 to 50 cars, and they were all quite beat up. You could tell they’d had accidents before.Afterwards, there was a huge party, right there, in the middle of the steppe. The horses were all beautifully dressed up and traditional Tuvan music was playing. The shaman had prayed the evening before for the spirits to be gentle. People come there to ask for healing.In Soviet times, Tuvan culture was suppressed. The shaman masks and  spirits – little puppets, sculptures, stuffed animals – were destroyed, and the people who continued to follow their ancient religions and traditions were persecuted. Now there’s this big revival, a newfound sense of pride.I grew up with Slavic fairytales about shamans and Baba Yaga. My mother is Russian and my grandfather was from Siberia. But I never really saw more of the country than Moscow, where I’d go to visit my grandmother in the summer. So last year I decided to go an exchange to Tomsk State University, in Siberia. I wanted to explore my roots.My plan was to travel the length of the Yenisei river. I couldn’t get to the actual source, which is further south in neighbouring Mongolia and only accessible by private helicopter. So I travelled to Tuva. You drive through what feels like endless Siberian woods and forested landscapes, you traverse one last mountain and suddenly you emerge on to the steppe. It feels like you’ve entered another world.People have gone there in search of freedom: adventurers, apostates, the Cossack riders pushing deeper and deeper into Siberia, criminals fleeing the Tsar. I met a man called Yuri who lived on a landfill. He told me if they chase him away, he’ll just find another landfill to live on. An ex-army officer I met, called Valentin, described himself as an anarchist ecologist. He sleeps outdoors, even when it’s -50C. This is one of the last remaining places where you can be removed from all western cultural influence, and live at one with nature.People in Tuva are tough. I’m attracted to people who are shaped by their environment, who choose to live or work in extreme situations. I think this kind of life fosters a certain kind of character. Not everyone chooses to live here, though. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva has become a place of great isolation, spiritual, physical and social.One day I went to a village where mostly Tuvan people live. Two grandmothers came outside. Perhaps because of the way I was dressed, they thought I was American. “What the hell are you doing here?” they said. “It’s Friday today. Everyone just got paid. Everyone is drunk, on their horses. Get out of here, it’s too dangerous.” And right then, two very drunk guys rode up to us. Nothing happened. But the horse came to symbolise for me this dualism – the quest for freedom and the pervasive isolation.• Nanna Heitmann is the winner of 2019’s Leica Oskar Barnack newcomer award for her series Hiding From Baba Yaga.Training: Photojournalism and documentary photography, University of Hanover.Influences: “The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow with its old Russian masters, the Magnum archive, Joel Sternfeld, Tarkovsky.”High point: “Every time I go out to photograph, to e into other people’s worlds.

Concrete residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments shot up across the country in a show of power from a state between two worlds, western democracy and the communist east. Photographs by Marko ĐuricaReuters. Written by Ivana Sekularac.Genex Tower is unmissable on the highway from Belgrade airport to the centre of the city. Its two soaring blocks, connected by an aerial bridge and topped with a long-closed rotating restaurant resembling a space capsule, are such an unusual sight, the 1977-build tower has become a magnet for tourists despite years of neglect. The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism – an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete.Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own – seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring – particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980.“We have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,” says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia’s once ubiquitous car. “Genex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.” Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds – western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.“Now enough time has passed (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,” says Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University’s architecture faculty. He explains that the style was unique because of its visible influence from the west, reflecting Yugoslavia’s unique position. Residential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.Keen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism – the Palata Srbija (Palace of Serbia) government building, which is currently only open once a year.The Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Each of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia.Furniture and carpets were custom made and prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics. The outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19-metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes. “It is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,” said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.Other examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito’s partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings. Many of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia.However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year. Miodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19-metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial, was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.“It is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,” he said. “For every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10bfd1f9a027bce070e66815412a60a755843321/0_0_2500_3127/master/2500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9d8aaf8e82d448a13436cd66b8e0791 1400w","title":"george rr martin wont write spinoffs game of thrones book finished house of the dragon winds of winter","story":"As TV prequel House of the Dragon is announced, author says finishing The Winds of Winter, the sixth volume of his saga, ‘remains my priority’George RR Martin has promised not to write any scripts for HBO’s new prequel show based on his imaginary history of the Targaryen family until he has “finished and delivered” The Winds of Winter, the long-awaited sixth book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series.Hours after the bloody world of Game of Thrones claimed another victim – a TV prequel set thousands of years before Martin’s books that has been scrapped – television network HBO gave the green light for a full 10-episode season called House of the Dragon, another prequel spinoff but focused on the brutal and fiery Targaryen dynasty.“The dragons are coming … back,” wrote Martin on his blog, after the announcement. He confirmed it would be set “a couple of centuries” before A Song of Ice and Fire, and draw upon the histories he created in his book Fire and Blood. House of the Dragon will be co-created by Martin and Ryan Condal, who was showrunner for the science fiction series Colony and who will produce the series alongside Miguel Sapochnik, who won an Emmy for his work on Game of Thrones.Martin revealed that House of the Dragon has been in development for several years, and was “actually the first concept I pitched to HBO when we started talking about a successor show, way back in the summer of 2016”. Condal, he said, has “already done a considerable amount of writing on House of the Dragon, but a lot of work remains ahead of us”.While Martin hoped to “be able to script a few episodes, as I did for the first four seasons of Game of Thrones”, he said he would not do so until the Winds of Winter was finished. The most recent book in the series, A Dance With Dragons, came out almost nine years ago.“Let me make this perfectly clear … I am not taking on any scripts until I have finished,” he wrote. “Winter is still coming, and Winds remains my priority, as much as I’d love to write an episode of House.”The novelist also expressed his disappointment at HBO’s decision not to proceed with the other adaptation, a pilot episode of which has already been shot written by Jane Goldman, directed by SJ Clarkson, and starring Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson.“It goes without saying that I was saddened to hear the show would not be going to series. Jane Goldman is a terrific screenwriter, and I enjoyed brainstorming with her,” said Martin. “I do not know why HBO decided not to go to series on this one, but I do not think it had to do with House of the Dragon. This was never an eitheror situation. If television has room enough for multiple CSIs and Chicago shows … well, Westeros and Essos are a lot bigger, with thousands of years of history and enough tales and legends and characters for a dozen shows.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1695437c206b65d0b8b0861dcd4119b2a0829c/0_19_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d17f0e5d7bcc1122a101b4d5897a78","title":"horror authors spookiest books anne rice dracula lauren beukes","story":"Anne Rice explains why she’s too frightened to finish Dracula, Lauren Beukes recalls a horrifying graphic novel and others share their most haunting readsTwo scenes come to mind immediately. As a child I tried to read the original Dracula but a scene in the early pages with the vampires absolutely horrified me: where the count drives his vampire brides away from the helpless mortal, Jonathan Harker. It’s then that a sack is revealed and inside it a wailing, half-smothered child, which the count gives to these vampire women. This so scared, so shocked, so horrified me, that I abandoned the book and took it back to the library. I have not, to this day, read Dracula in its entirety.The second was in Stephen King’s Salem’s Lot, when Matt overhears his overnight guest Mike say to someone, “Yes. Come in,” in the upstairs bedroom. And then Matt hears the sound of the window hasp being turned and the sound of the window opening. Now, this is an upstairs window. Matt knows a vampire has entered the house via the window and by invitation from Mike. He’s is obviously terrified. And so was I.• Anne Rice is the author of Interview With the Vampire.With their painted mouths and uncanny valley eyes, porcelain dolls have always creeped me out, but after reading Cuckoo Song by Frances Hardinge, they are now firmly in the “Oh God, no” category alongside clowns-in-drains, Arctic ghosts and mysterious whistles on deserted east coast beaches. A deliciously twisty spin on a changeling story, Cuckoo Song is aimed at young readers. But thanks to Hardinge’s extraordinary gift for atmospheric storytelling, it scared the crap out of this fortysomething – most notably when the troubled protagonist’s dolls come to life and start screaming. Yes, screaming. Here’s a taster: “Its glass eyes seemed to come into proper focus, and then the doll flinched and started to shake. Its mouth fell open, emitting a low, eerie mewl …”Buy it for the kid in your life now. It’s a win-win: guaranteed to put them off Barbies for life, while developing a taste for brilliant, imaginatively written fiction.For me, one of the most disquieting scenes is in Elizabeth Jane Howard’s Three Miles Up. The premise of two friends losing their way on a lonely stretch of canal is unsettling enough, but it’s the more subtle moments of eeriness that give the story its power. The deeper Clifford and John guide the narrowboat into the wilderness, the further they drift from reality. They find a strange girl sleeping on the banks and take her aboard the cottages by the towpath disappear overnight the elderly man with the scythe who gives them directions to the village “three miles up” they meet again further along as a little boy.But the very end of the story is the most chilling …Emily Carroll’s Through the Woods is rich with malevolence and horrifying endnotes, using a muted palette shot through with crimson. All the stories are unsettling, but it’s a scene from the story The Nesting Place that is nested inside me – and gives Junji Ito and HP Lovecraft a run for their money. Bell’s mother raised her on stories of monsters – the fog with a thousand mouths, the not-a-man with the piano key teeth, and the worst of all, the burrowing kind: “The sort that crawled into you and made a home there. The sort you couldn’t name, the sort you couldn’t see. The monster that ate you alive from the inside out.” So when the teenage Bell visits her brother and his fiance at their country house, she recognises the signs, as does the reader. The terrible reveal of the creature’s face, or rather what lies behind her face, inside her skin, hot and red and writhing and full of need, was creepy as hell. • Lauren Beukes is the author of Broken Monsters and The Shining Girls.MR James immediately comes to mind - the bag that puts its arms around your neck in the dark, the mouth that waits for you to find it under your pillow, the dog whose head you pat only to realise that it has a human face that shouldn’t be alive. In refining the tale of supernatural horror to its essence, James increased the terror, and among his living inheritors is Adam Nevill, who is at least equally committed to intensity of dread. The entire first section of his novel No One Gets Out Alive feels like a nightmare that grows ever more relentless, from which we may never waken, and that’s my choice for sheer unrelieved fear.• Ramsey Campbell is the author of more than 30 novels and hundreds of short stories.The scene that springs to mind for me is from Salem’s Lot by Stephen King. Vampires are like sharks for me – equally fascinating and terrifying, despite the fact that, in reality, neither is likely to bite me. But still, vampire fiction was responsible for me not opening a window at night until I was about 25, and this scene still frightens me if I’m awake at night. It is when young and very dead Danny Glick turns up at his friend Mark Petrie’s second floor window, tapping on the glass and asking to be let inside, his skin pale and teeth long and sharp. And now I’ve brought that back up in my memory, I’ll be sleeping with the hall light on tonight!• Which book’s scenes scared you most?

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Hope school was OK. Are you buying that? Hope you have a lovely dinner.’ That can be an encouragement – the world is a safer place than they think. And actually that transmission of kindness shows maybe there is a possibility of communication, particularly for those who are shy or withdrawn. It’s really important that they expand their experiences to learn that while they might have had really difficult experiences, there could be other people who actually can be protective and supportive.”Talking to younger childrenGetting people, especially children, to open up, and share their feelings and thoughts can be trickier than we sometimes think. But Bush suggests that the best reason to reach children is to remember that they are people, albeit a little younger than us.“Remember, children and young people are people. The reason I say that is, we like to be spoken to in an empathetic and understanding way. Most of us prefer someone to talk to us at our own eye height.“Let’s say a six-year-old child is banging two toys together. Instead of jumping to a conclusion, try: ‘Oh, I see Superman really wants to hit Batman today, what are they fighting about?’ You never know where those kinds of questions – which start with the experience of the young person, in their world, using their metaphors – can lead to. The way into it is just by allowing the person to talk in the way they want to talk.”Listen, understand, empathiseMaking sure we’re really listening, and understanding what a person is saying to us, might sound simple, but it’s all too easy to trivialise without even realising it. “The other really important thing is not to be overly reassuring, and not to dismiss things,” says Bush.“For instance, a 21-year-old comes home and says: ‘I’m having a horrific time at work. I feel bullied, I’m failing, I feel I need to just walk away, I’m really stressed.’ Someone might reply: ‘Yeah, we all feel like that’. This kind of response is so demeaning, so dismissive. It doesn’t recognise their pain and distress.“Listen, acknowledge and be understanding. The sheer amount of people who just wanted to hear ‘Wow, that sounds really difficult. I can’t believe you’re been going through that’ as a first response … They didn’t need platitudes or complexity. They just wanted to be understood.”Connections mean resilience“There’s a lot of evidence that shows that social connectedness, a feeling of belonging – particularly connecting with people who have had similar or shared life interests or experiences – is actually very protective,” says Bush. “So young people who feel like they belong, who feel they have a sense of community, and feel able to talk to others in some way, are more resilient in the face of adversity, difficulty or mental health problems.”Britain Get TalkingTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itvbritaingettalking or stv.tvbritaingettalking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bd5656b7d2dda598ed779e598e904eb4c90289/0_239_3937_2362/master/3937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22f11251b6b4a2522c3dd8735a18c82","title":"new bank of england governor decision put off until after election","story":"Sajid Javid abandons plans to announce top job at the Bank during ‘sensitive period’The announcement of a successor for Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England has been postponed until after the general election.With only days to go until parliament is dissolved, the chancellor Sajid Javid has abandoned plans to announce his choice for Threadneedle Street’s top job during the autumn.The chancellor is believed to have made the decision to delay because he felt that making a choice at a politically sensitive time might damage the independence of the Bank.The Treasury believes there will still be time for the newly appointed governor to be fully prepared to take over at the Bank by the time Carney is due to end his six-and-a-half stint at the end of January next year.At this stage, there are no plans to ask Carney – who has twice extended his term – to stay on, with the Treasury confident that the new government will be in a position to make an appointment from a slate of candidates soon after the election on 12 December.A panel of senior officials and the former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker sent a shortlist of candidates to the Treasury after holding interviews with applicants over the summer.The shortlist is thought to include Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority Minouche Shafik, head of the London School of Economics Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK and Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, both deputy governors at the Bank.Several candidates cited as likely to be popular with the Treasury were not interviewed, including the former head of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan.The shortlist is understood to have excluded Gerard Lyons, a Eurosceptic economist and former adviser to Boris Johnson when he was London mayor, who applied for the role.Carney, however, was not on the shortlist drawn up to find a successor to Lord Mervyn King in 2013, and there is a possibility that if Labour won the election that the current shadow chancellor John McDonnell would want to appoint someone not currently in the frame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e849db70cbf50581891cf990beb5be6f8c92bdfd/0_0_5083_3049/master/5083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a29b5bbb14f49599ba87667426602b8","title":"hex in the city which terrifying town celebrates halloween hardest","story":"Derry boasts a four-day festival, while in West Hollywood 500,000 revellers take part in a huge LGBT event – but which city goes the furthest to spook its citizens?On a dark, dark night, in a dark, dark town, on a dark, dark street, skeletons, witches and zombies gather. There’s even the odd devil or two. The legions of the dead have come together for an annual Halloween night parade that will be watched by thousands of costumed revellers. But this isn’t the US – a country most people consider to be the Halloween mothership – this is Derry, Northern Ireland.The Derry Halloween festival started small in the mid-80s as a fancy dress disco in a pub. Now it has snowballed into a massive four-day event, with more than 120,000 people attending in 2018 – double the number from 2016. On Halloween night itself, there were 45,000 people watching the parade and fireworks. The sheer size of the extravaganza hasn’t gone unnoticed across the pond either, with USA Today crowning it the world’s best Halloween destination in 2015. So is it safe to say Derry is the capital of Halloween? Or are there other cities that go even further?“In most other organised festivals, you are bringing something to the people, but this is the people bringing something to the world,” McCarter says. “Halloween is to Derry what carnival is to Rio or what new year is to Edinburgh. Instead of Christmas stuff, supermarket aisles are full of Halloween merchandise. There are pop-up shops that have been open for the last three weeks selling purely Halloween things. People plan their costumes at least a year in advance. Even local people who have left the city come back. In the same way that people come back for Christmas, people from Derry come back for Halloween.”Ireland’s connection with All Hallows’ Eve dates back millennia to the Celtic festival of Samhain when spirits were believed to walk the Earth before the new year began on 1 November. It is thought the ancient tradition was first introduced to the US by Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the mid-19th century. So which city in this Halloween-mad nation deserves the title of pumpkin king? After taking into account factors such as trick or treat friendliness, general fun and even the average weather forecast, website WalletHub did the maths and ranked New York City number one and Los Angeles a close second as the most spook-tacular places to enjoy the annual frightfest.One of the most popular activities to do during Halloween is to attend a party or parade and both the top cities boast some of the biggest shindigs around. The largest event in New York City is the Village Halloween Parade on the evening of 31 October. About 60,000 revellers will join in the costumed march up 6th Avenue to 16th Street, while an estimated 2 million people watch it.“It’s full of the energy and creativity of NYC,” says Jeanne Fleming, artistic and producing director of New York’s Village Halloween Parade. “The parade is a folk art phenomenon … it often reflects the zeitgeist of what is happening in the world and then all the iniduals take that on. Its energy derives from its state of constant change and renewal with the underpinnings of ancient ritual.”Their owners, meanwhile, could take inspiration from this year’s Google data, which reveals some of the most searched-for outfits in the US. The evil clown Pennywise from the film and Stephen King novel It is ranked the most popular costume in 2019, searched for most in five cities including Zanesville, Ohio, and Harrisonburg, Virginia. Spider-Man is a favourite in Meridian, Mississippi, and a dinosaur is a hit in several cities including Boston, Massachusetts. The top costume in the city of Bangor, Maine, however, is a character from the game Fortnite. If you’re looking for a less scary option, head to Fairbanks, Alaska, where a fairy is the costume most Googled.The UK has the most Halloween-themed events listed on the Eventbrite website, outside of the US. That’s followed by Canada, Australia, and Ireland. In fact, the number of UK Halloween-related events listed on the website has more than trebled since 2015, to about 2,000 events across the country this year. Most of those are hosted in London, followed by Glasgow and Manchester.One trend that the company has noticed is the increasing number of heritage sites hosting haunted house events. The 300-year-old Mansion House in York – voted the UK’s most haunted city in 2002 – is one such historic venue keen to embrace Halloween by hosting their own family friendly ghost tour.Mansion House marketing manager Ellie Davies says: “It’s a beautiful Georgian building and lends itself well to that spooky aesthetic. We’ve decorated the whole house in cobwebs, we have sinister creaking noises, headless ghosts and spooky silhouettes.”The local tourist board has been promoting York’s haunted reputation and making the most of Halloween’s surge in popularity, says Davies. “We have got everything that makes York a spooky city. We have got the Shambles, we’ve got hidden doors in walls, we’ve got creepy archways and old buildings. It all comes together to create this spooky environment and people are wanting more and more.”For children, one of the most exciting aspects of Halloween is trick or treating. But the quality and quantity of your haul may depend on where you live. According to 2017 data from Statista, Brighton is the best city to knock on neighbours’ doors for sweets, with residents forking out an average of £18.60 per person on Halloween treats each year. On the other hand, children living in Hull are less lucky with just an average of £1.70 a year spent on Halloween treats.Halloween appears to have the ability to not only cross continents but also cultures. One city in which it has taken root is Tokyo, Japan. Large scale celebrations first began at the capital’s Disneyland theme park but have now spread across the city. Residents have embraced the western festival, blending their own tradition of “cosplay” – or “costume play” – with the supernatural horror themes of Halloween.The biggest event in town is the massive Kawasaki Halloween Parade. It only started in 1997 but now attracts more than 100,000 people who line the 1.5km route through the Tokyo district dressed as everything from a Samsung phone to a giant toothbrush. As well as this, the annual Harajuku-Omotesando Hello Halloween Pumpkin Parade features more than 3,000 costumed children under 12 parading along the 700-metre zelkova tree-lined section of Omotesando. Shibuya on the other hand has been the scene of Halloween mayhem in recent years with extra security being brought in this year to stop impromptu street parties from spiralling out of control.As Halloween fever spreads around the world, not everyone is happy about what is seen as a US import that is displacing their own cultural traditions. Despite its critics, the festival is showing no signs of slowing down.

Iconic classics that stand the test of time are the ultimate rebuff to “What was I thinking?” fads. Here, we reveal the timeless prints, styles and colours you’ll want to wear again and again.From snake to zebra, plus a few tigers on the prowl, the collections walked on the wild side this season. But leopard knocks the spots off every other print. Why? It’s universally flattering, powerful, seductive and, most likely, already in your closet.If only real life was as rose-tinted as the catwalks, where this most feminine of hues proliferated in shades from millennial to bubblegum and beyond. Is the use of pink a celebration of girl power, a protest, or simply a delicious pop of colour? If you ask us, it’s all three.The bourgeois tweed blazer, the rainproof mackintosh, a tartan wool coat: check autumnwinter outerwear off your list. Throw in argyle and houndstooth for the full compendium of this brilliantly British trend.The ultimate nine-to-five look in the 1960s and 1970s, the gloriously girly pussy-bow blouse has stood the test of time, with contemporary fans including Kate Middleton and Amal Clooney.

Malted milk. Bourbon. There’s a delicious hint of the biscuit barrel to the new season’s palette, so layer up in cosy neutral shades as the weather cools.Drop your vision of an irate football manager in a duvet coat – if you shop clever, a padded jacket is a stylish, hardy perennial. To ensure yours looks fresh for years, look for plumped-up panels and a removable hood. Colour? Keep things classic with navy, khaki, grey or black.Fashion trends that stand the test of time need a shoe that is just as hard working. With a wide range of colours, prints and styles, the classic shapes and comfort fits of Clarks’s new AW19 range provides the perfect final touch, whatever the trend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00b84ec47e131a0a0024ad917ae8fed2001c94de/0_8_5238_3143/master/5238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5538ccd8c75d083890cb291cb1656558","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook regulate","story":"Let us be grateful for small mercies. Thank you Twitter for banning political advertising. Given that such advertising is by its nature biased, tendentious and hard to check, Twitter is behaving as a good publisher should. Politicians may make full use of its outlet. That is democracy. But as the organisation’s chief, Jack Dorsey, points out, with social media awash in “micro-targeting, deepfakes, manipulated videos and misinformation”, those who control it should keep it as clean as possible. Money may not buy truth, but it should not drown fairness.Facebook disagrees. Its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, declares it “not right for private companies to censor politicians or the news”. He subscribes to the romantic view of social media as the yellow brick road of digital’s global village. The road should not dictate who travels along it, it should just collect the tolls. That includes advertisers, the sustenance of Zuckerberg’s $500bn empire. This argument reruns the celebrated – or notorious – US supreme court ruling on Citizens United in 2010, which overturned restrictions on campaign finance as being an offence against free speech. From then on, lobbyists, corporations, tycoons, anyone with money, could spend what they liked during an election. It declared open season for fake news, targeted ads and dark money “Super Pacs”. That season gave us Donald Trump, and has yet to close.There was some argument for the 2010 decision, as there is in Zuckerberg’s opposition to curbs on advertising. If an ad is mendacious, let the reader judge it as such. Don’t censor the web. If you suppress one form of debate, you shift power to another – in this case editors of the “elitist media”. The democracy of the web should be free to air, come poor and rich. This might have cut ice in digital’s golden age, the nineties and noughties. If you let everything hang out, was the line, global peace would emerge as if from a celestial algorithm. It has not turned out that way. Not a day passes without some new evil being laid at social media’s door, from Instagram’s part in the death of British teenager Molly Russell to the persecution of Britain’s female MPs.We can all see benefits in the digital revolution. We can also see bad driving out good. As catalogued in Shoshana Zuboff’s tome of our times, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, we get intrusion, bullying, obscenity and extremism in a thousand devious guises.Zuckerberg’s oft-repeated claim that he is not a “publisher” is self-serving rubbish. His platforms are devices to project information and opinion into the public realm for profit – as precise a definition of publication as I know. To allow users to do this anonymously and without liability is a licence to mendacity and slander. It pollutes debate and corrupts democracy.Free markets are a blessing to human society, but since Adam Smith they have tended towards monopoly and self-interest. Social media are no different. Zuckerberg makes the same claim as America’s gun lobby: Facebook does not kill people, people do. As the Edward Snowden revelations showed, the boundary between social media and mass surveillance, whether by capitalism or the state, is now hopelessly permeable. Like any market, this one must be regulated. It is a poor comment on western democracy that it still is not.Anyone delving into this realm is easily lost in technology and jargon, but we must try. Wiser heads – including at times Zuckerberg himself – have recognised that things are getting out of hand. Facebook, Google and Twitter this year lobbied the British government to introduce a mechanism for combating “online harm”. They remain reluctant to take that responsibility themselves.I believe this presents a regulatory challenge on a scale not seen since the early debates over nuclear weapons. We must somehow disentangle the public from the private digital sphere. There must be control over those who trade the identities and behaviour of inidual citizens. We must define the concept of causing online harm, as distinct from causing offence. We must place obligation and liability on digital “publishers” for the accuracy and legality of third-party content – as we do on conventional publishers.As in any public forum, anonymity must end for those expecting the privilege of access to public debate. Facebook and others accept de facto moral liability, by filtering and censoring “unsuitable” content. They accept, at last, that showing teenagers how to take their own lives is not free speech but public menace.Now they must accept that regulators should dictate the rules of democracy, or it will degenerate into an online Game of Thrones. Publishers have an obligation not to disseminate lies. One reason for the ongoing popularity of the mainstream media, such as the BBC, the New York Times and this newspaper, is that their information is trusted. Some editor is subjecting their output to some ideal of balance, fairness and accuracy. Material is not spewed out at random, or targeted so as to confirm inidual bias. Editors are not, as early web enthusiasts predicted, out of date. They are necessary.The British press has fought against state regulation, other than over monopoly and laws of libel. I think that is right, not out of principle but because statutory regulation is not justified by press misbehaviour or imbalance – or not yet. Self-regulation sort of works. At present it is not the mainstream media driving decent people out of politics. It is what Zuboff calls the “psychic numbing of strip-search technology”. We have not begun to grasp its potency or its aura of invincibility. Today’s robber barons steal from us not our money but something more important, our privacy and integrity as iniduals. They cannot remain unregulated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69cceeee94512c5094fb5beff7e3462b68622bbd/0_185_3190_1913/master/3190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=368a9e3b09df08d7ffd25025d4006236","title":"the guardian view on election 2019 its about brexit above all","story":"If the leavers, the Conservative reactionaries, the neoliberals and the ranks of Britain’s rightwing press – to say nothing of their friends Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – had had their way, Friday would have been Britain’s first day outside the European Union since 31 December 1972. But the Halloween deadline has come and gone. Instead, largely as a result of the ruthless parliamentary exposure of Boris Johnson’s shabby political quackery, Britain remains part of Europe. Friday is therefore a day for relief and a modest celebration, not for defeat or dejection. A place in Europe, for which so many have fought so hard over the last three and a half years, remains ours. But its future now rests on the result of the general election in six weeks’ time.Mr Johnson captured the prime ministership in July on a shamelessly false prospectus. He promised he could get Britain out by 31 October, “whatever happens”. He told his party conference that it would happen “come what may”. He said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for another extension. Enough Tory members – 90,000 mainly white, elderly men living in southern England (fewer people than the population of Tunbridge Wells) – were taken in by this for him to oust Theresa May. But, as with most of Mr Johnson’s promises, these were merely cheap words. Like Mrs May, he ran into the stubborn reality that a majority of MPs want to stop any precipitate departure from the EU. Rather than compromise, as he should have done, Mr Johnson has now bounced the Commons into a premature election.He may have been its leader for only a little over three months, but Mr Johnson has had a major impact on his party. He has triggered and presided over a tranformation of the Tories into a rightwing nationalist party. What was once a broadly based movement of the centre-right is now a political sect, defined by a single issue, Brexit, which increasingly places the party on the wrong side of history.The exodus this week of centrist Conservative MPs who have had enough is eloquent testimony to that. The list of the expelled and the withdrawing, who include Ken Clarke, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond, Jo Johnson, Oliver Letwin, David Lidington, Nicky Morgan, Amber Rudd and Rory Stewart, adds up to both a lost generation and a lost Tory tradition. Mims Davies, the employment minister, said this week that she is quitting, and asked whether female Tory MPs are going because of “the horrid state of the discourse, the threats, the hours, the lack of time with friends and family or never being able to switch off”. The upshot, as Iain Duncan Smith boasted this week, is stark. The Tories, he said, “are the Brexit party now”.As many have pointed out, a general election is an election about everything. Jeremy Corbyn, launching Labour’s campaign on Thursday, will fight it on austerity. The SNP will fight it on Scottish independence. In Northern Ireland, the election will, as ever, be about the union. None of these is a secondary issue. Yet Mr Duncan Smith’s words cut through the jungle of other issues to identify what this election is most irrevocably about. It is about whether the UK will leave the EU and end its commitment to Europe, or whether it will not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/706308b50e04fe4f08ae1541faae51b085889c21/0_0_941_576/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39aa4ff4791ca69a333a8541b0299c14","title":"are you a teacher who has left the uk to work abroad","story":"If you’re a primary or secondary school teacher who has left a school in England to teach in another country, we would like to hear from you Schools in England are struggling to recruit and retain sufficient teachers.

Pearl-studded Nicholas Kirkwood shoes (£200) and round, oxblood Mulberry bags (£465) are displayed in an uncluttered, brightly lit space that also features a rack beneath a backlit sign inviting customers to deposit items to sell.Among a handful of expensive, rare pieces – such as a red-velvet Gucci suit designed during Tom Ford’s time as creative director, on sale for an eye-watering £4,275 – there are high-end items available at Zara-level prices, including a pair of Acne jeans for £45.“The customer mindset has changed,” said Fanny Moizant, the co-founder and president of Vestiaire Collective. “In the car industry, it is perfectly normal for customers to ask themselves – do I buy new or secondhand?

There’s a lot of hunger and desire.”Parish sees the academy proposals as a chance to expand Roy Hodgson’s first-team options, proposing that within three years the current squad of 18-19 senior pros will be expanded to 25 by including academy graduates and development players (those around the age of 20) who have been brought into the club but are not yet ready for the top flight.Though Parish insists he is not in the business of raising talents for other clubs, there is also the prospect that good academy graduates can fetch substantial transfer fees. Aaron Wan‑Bissaka is proof of that formula, after he joined Manchester United for £50m this summer.“You can see with clubs like Chelsea and Manchester City they’ve got this long tail of talent, while our aspiration often isn’t even to get to 25 players, because if we’re buying elite talent we can’t afford it, quite frankly,” Parish said. “To have a 25-man squad would be a massive, massive plus.“For managers there’s so many positives in bringing through young talent because they don’t expect to play. You can use them sparingly, you can bring them on and off, use them in the League Cup. That’s our aim. That’s as key to this as anything.”So the business case is clear (and Palace might kick themselves for not having adopted it sooner, with not only Chelsea but Millwall and Charlton doing their best to acquire south London talent). But Parish also speaks well on the pastoral side of academy work, echoing the belief now widely held in football circles that well-rounded young men make for better professional athletes.“What you are seeing are different types of young men, not just different footballers,” he said. “How adept and mature these guys are is really impressive. Being thrust into the limelight at 19, 20 years old, it’s a lot more than just about football and you only really know what they’re made of when they step out in front of 26,000 people.“That mental strength comes from a lot of places and for some of the boys in our care these aspects are as important as the coaching. Many of them have got all the footballing ability in the world but the only place they feel at home is on the pitch. The care that has been put in place, genuine care, is exceptional. We’ve got the best academy system in the world. We just want to be on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17b45b8125f4ed376d12faa5e77730176a1ea55a/0_72_1345_806/master/1345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bf3eacc039445ceff4ec540e1d14276","title":"granit xhaka arsenal squad fully behind emiliano martinez","story":"• Captain under fire after clashing with fans last weekend• Xhaka reveals abuse he received from Arsenal fansGranit Xhaka has admitted he “reached boiling point” after being targeted by Arsenal supporters during the draw against Crystal Palace and blamed his angry response on abuse he had received, including physical threats and taunts that wished his daughter would get cancer.The Switzerland midfielder gestured and swore at the crowd after he was jeered as he was substituted in the 2-2 draw against Palace last Sunday with his manager, Unai Emery, later admitting the club had suggested the captain should apologise to the fans. However, four days after the incident that was not exactly forthcoming from Xhaka, who instead issued a statement on Instagram which attempted to explain his reaction.“My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have hurt me deeply. People have said things like ‘We will break your legs’, ‘Kill your wife’ and ‘Wish that your daughter gets cancer’. That has stirred me up and I reached boiling point when I felt the rejection in the stadium on Sunday.“In this situation I let myself get carried away and reacted in a way that disrespected the group of fans that support our club, our team and myself with positive energy. That has not been my intention and I’m sorry if that’s what people thought. My wish is to get back to a place of mutual respect, remembering why we fell in love with this game in the first place. Let’s move forward positively together.”Xhaka was rested for the Carabao Cup tie against Liverpool on Wednesday but is expected to be available for selection for the home game against Wolves on Saturday.The goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez is adamant that the players are still backing their captain. Asked whether they had spoken to the Xhaka, the Spanish goalkeeper said: “We always do, all of us.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Celebrated the night before Halloween in certain parts of the north of England, Mischief Night is an informal occasion for callow teenagers to come together on the streets and celebrate their vitality by playing mischievous pranks on unsuspecting local folk in the name of b@nter. Known locally in Liverpool as “Mizzy Night”, Wednesday’s celebration has been hailed as “the worst ever” after gangs of young hooligans caused untold misery, carnage and destruction when they set about vandalising cars, businesses and homes, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage and prompting the local mayor to describe them as “feral”.While most of those guilty of this lawless, anti-social behaviour will escape uncaught and unpunished, the identities of one group of youths who made significant contributions to the chaos visited upon Merseyside on Wednesday night can be revealed. Members of an Anfield Road-based gang known as Liverpool Football Club, Sepp van der Berg (17), Harvey Elliott (16), Rhian Brewster (19), Curtis Jones (18) and the comparatively elderly Caoimhin Kelleher (20) were fingered by no shortage of witnesses as being among those whose high-spirited exuberance was a major contributory factor towards one of the most chaotic games in recent years. All five whippersnappers started or finished Liverpool’s ludicrously entertaining 5-5 draw with Arsenal, with Jones scoring one decisive penalty in the shootout shortly after Kelleher had saved another to help put their side into the quarter-finals of the Littlewoods Cup.“I was so happy for the kids that they will remember their first night at Anfield for the rest of their life,” said their babysitter, Jürgen Klopp. “Maybe as a manager I should think more about or worry about the goals that we conceded but I couldn’t care less to be honest. I couldn’t care less tonight.” For all the pleasure Klopp’s young tyros provided, their precocious talent has also landed him with another game to plan for in an already packed December schedule.Currently facing the prospect of playing a match every three or four days throughout the final month of the year, Liverpool now face the prospect of meeting Aston Villa in the Milk Cup at the same time as they are playing Biggest Cup 3,500 miles away in Qatar. Unimpressed with the situation in which his team find themselves, Klopp has suggested his side may actually have to withdraw from the competition in which they progressed. “If they can’t find the proper date for us and I don’t mean Christmas Day, 3am … then we can’t play the game,” he tooted. “Our opponents will progress. We will not be the victims of this problem.” A fair point, perhaps, but like their counterparts wreaking havoc on “Mizzy Night”, Klopp’s new breed need to learn that actions – commendable or otherwise – invariably have consequences.“With regards to Derby County and their moral stand after sacking Richard Keogh. Of course ‘the club will not tolerate any of its players or staff behaving in a manner which puts themselves, their colleagues, and members of the general public at risk of injury or worse’, especially, of course in a man in his mid-30s who may have had his career ended. I must have missed the sacking of those younger, still-fit-to-play men who were actually drink-driving.

Cristiano Ronaldo bagging a 95th-minute winner to put Juventus back on top of the table. Six players sent off in an evening, and Carlo Ancelotti seeing red, too, after his Napoli team blew their second lead of the night against Atalanta. Serie A’s midweek round was certainly eventful.We will get to all the stories mentioned above, but this also feels like a moment when we need to talk about Chris Smalling. He scored his first Serie A goal on Wednesday, the second of four in Roma’s romp past Udinese. The strike itself was nothing special – not even the best of the night by a centre-back playing for a club from Italy’s capital – but it was a moment to cherish for a player who has relaunched his career superbly in Italy over the past couple of months.Smalling’s arrival in late August felt like an afterthought. Roma had been working throughout the transfer window to reinforce a defence that conceded 48 goals last season, and which lost its one reliable performer when Napoli triggered Kostas Manolas’s release clause.Gianluca Mancini was signed from Atalanta – a richly-talented 23-year-old who had won his first senior Italy caps earlier in the year – but attempts to bring in an experienced partner to play alongside him were less successful. Roma landed on Smalling only after having bids for Toby Alderweireld and Dejan Lovren turned down. Fiorentina’s German Pezzella and Juventus’s Daniele Rugani were also considered, but in both cases the asking price was too high.He is well-suited to the style of football preferred by Paulo Fonseca. The Roma manager, hired from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer, prefers a high defensive line, making pace an essential trait for his centre-backs. Smalling told Roma’s club website this month that he has enjoyed being placed in inidual duels.“In England quite often you have to deal with just one striker, so you’ve got your other central defender covering you – whereas often here you can be left two-on-two a lot of the time,” he said. “There’s a lot more runs in behind being made too … I’m enjoying it – because I quite like a tussle and a sprint against the striker. It definitely suits my game.”Fonseca’s Roma are a team in evolution, still adapting to the coach’s ideas. Early in the season, the commitment to pressing opponents inside their own half bordered on the reckless, leading to chaotic end-to-end matches against Genoa and Sassuolo. More recently, there has been greater balance, though that is aided too by Smalling’s recovery speed – a sharp contrast with the week-one starter, Juan Jesus.That the Englishman is taking on his coaches’ instructions is evident in other areas, too. When Edin Dzeko scored Roma’s opener against Milan at the weekend, it was with the assistance of a well-choreographed crossing run from Smalling, to take out his marker at a corner.Conversely, his most frustrating moment to date only won him more sympathy from Roma’s supporters. Smalling was adjudged to have given away a penalty in the 90th minute of his team’s Europa League game against Borussia Mönchengladbach, allowing the Germans to equalise. In reality, the ball hit him in the face. Social media was awash with surrealist memes.Even putting his goal to one side, Smalling played well again on Wednesday. His centre-back partner Federico Fazio was harshly sent off after half an hour following a coming-together with Stefano Okaka, but Roma, already a goal up by that stage, rarely looked in danger of conceding after they were reduced to 10 men.Mancini, who started in midfield, dropped back into defence in what became a 4-4-1, but the Giallorossi continued to dictate the play. Smalling made the score 2-0 when he pounced on Kevin Lasagna’s uncertain touch at a corner, jabbing the ball home at the back post. Justin Kluivert and Aleksandar Kolarov completed the rout.Asked afterwards whether his loan move to Roma could become permanent, Smalling deferred, saying that: “Anything could happen.” The club, at least, are keen, with the sporting director, Gianluca Petrachi, suggesting that he would open discussions with United if the player wanted to stay.Victory moved Roma up to fourth, an impressive position when set against their lengthy injury list. Bryan Cristante, Lorenzo Pellegrini, Amadou Diawara, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Davide Zappacosta and Nikola Kalinic are all presently sidelined. Edin Dzeko has been playing in a protective face mask after fracturing his cheekbone.Despite it all, they are now ahead of Napoli – whose draw against Atalanta arrived in controversial circumstances. The Partenopei were leading 2-1 in the 85th minute when Simon Kjaer rugby-tackled Fernando Llorente in the penalty area. Play continued, and Atalanta scored at the far end.It was precisely the sort of refereeing error that VAR was designed to correct. Yet the officials in the replay booth never recommended that Piero Giacomelli conduct a pitch-side review. Some commentators have since suggested that Llorente initiated the contact with Kjaer, making it impossible to call this a “clear and obvious” penalty decision. This column respectfully disagrees.Asked about his red card, Ancelotti claimed the referee had asked him to help restore order among furious players. “I said: ‘Don’t you think there’s even a chance it could have been a penalty?’ In response, he threw me out. I feel as though my professionalism has been attacked.”Further contentious decisions would follow in Turin, where Juventus’s winning goal came from a Ronaldo penalty which he earned for himself in second-half injury time. Antonio Sanabria’s challenge was clumsy and perhaps made enough contact with the forward’s shin to justify a spot-kick. But Ronaldo’s delayed reaction and exaggerated fall, deliberately kicking out his back leg, looked more ridiculous with each repeat viewing.The second booking collected by Genoa’s Francesco Cassata earlier in the match, furthermore, was hard to justify. It all added up to a bullet dodged by Juventus – wearing a bizarre fourth-kit with fluorescent green sponsor’s logo – who did not play at all well.Nor, truthfully, did Inter in their victory over Brescia on Tuesday. The goals of Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez, who opened the scoring with a heavily deflected shot, are covering a lot of ills for Antonio Conte’s team.Yet the Belgian’s run to celebrate with his manager, after bending his shot into the far corner from 20 yards, felt like the key visual from this game. Conte, just like Fonseca with Smalling at Roma, is getting the most out of a player who Manchester United were only too happy to discard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a9120816467d5f52548bf06cd26c399bcfa57a/192_0_4334_2600/master/4334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3ade45ad09b1b18afce5403ec69f16","title":"bat faces landmark legal case over malawi families poverty wages","story":"Exclusive: Lawyers seeking compensation in UK for child labourers and their parentsHuman rights lawyers are preparing to bring a landmark case against British American Tobacco on behalf of hundreds of children and their families forced by poverty wages to work in conditions of gruelling hard labour in the fields of Malawi.Leigh Day’s lawyers are seeking compensation for more than 350 child labourers and their parents in the high court in London, arguing that the British company is guilty of “unjust enrichment”. Leigh Day says it anticipates the number of child labourer claimants to rise as high as 15,000. While BAT claims it has told farmers not to use their children as unpaid labour, the lawyers say the families cannot afford to work their fields otherwise, because they receive so little money for their crop.The case, potentially one of the biggest that human rights lawyers have ever brought, could transform the lives of children in poor countries who are forced to work to survive not only in tobacco but also in other industries such as the garment trade.It follows exposure of the scale and brutal reality of child labour in the tobacco fields by the  last year, which Martyn Day, a founding partner and head of the firm, said had provoked them to act. “If it hadn’t been for the , this case would not be happening,” he said.Day added: “It is totally depressing that one of the largest companies in the world, and certainly one of the largest British companies, is involved in an area where the employment of children is such a fundamental part of what happens. It has been going on for decades, and as a result of all of that the farmers of Malawi are caught in a groundhog day, where one generation after another is having to farm tobacco and is caught in a poverty trap.”Many of the families are from Phalombe, one of the poorest regions in the south of the country. They are recruited to tobacco farms in the north with the promise of food, accommodation and a lump sum in cash for their crop. Their accommodation is a straw hut they must build themselves the food is a monthly sack of maize, which is insufficient to feed the family and which is stopped before their tenancy ends. The lump sum they are paid at the end of the season dwindles often to less than half what is offered after deductions for tools and loans that the families have to take out to pay for essentials.According to the letter of claim, seen by the , last season most claimants earned no more than £100 to £200 for 10 months’ work for a family of five. Their lawyers say the work amounts to forced or bonded labour because they are misled when recruited, are afraid to leave and quickly get into debt. Children as young as three are involved in tobacco farming, the letter of claim says, often during harvest when the work can be especially hazardous. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic pesticides, fertiliser and green tobacco sickness, from nicotine absorption while handling the leaves. Symptoms include breathing difficulties, cramps and vomiting.Some children go to school, as the law requires, but often only sporadically. Almost all work from sunrise in the fields before school and then when they get home, as well as through the weekend. At harvest time, classrooms empty.BAT is one of the most profitable companies in the world, making an operating profit last year of £9.3bn on sales of £24.5bn. Like other big tobacco companies, it has distanced itself from the farmers by commissioning a separate company to buy a stipulated amount of tobacco leaf each year. Alliance One signs contracts with land-owning farmers in Malawi, who then recruit tenant farmer families to work the fields.The lawyers, who have sent BAT the letter of claim and say they expect to issue proceedings this year, argue that responsibility for the conditions of the tenant families rests ultimately with BAT, which decides the price it will pay for tobacco leaf. In April, Leigh Day won a watershed case against Vedanta, a British mining company, which the high court held responsible for the actions of its subsidiary in polluting farmland in Zambia. That case opened the way to hold other British companies responsible for harm caused by the actions of those who work for them overseas.A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million children under the age of 14 working in tobacco around the world. In 2017, an International Labour Organisation report said child labour in tobacco was on the increase and “rampant”. Day said: “If we are successful in Malawi, I would very much hope it would persuade BAT and the other tobacco companies that use very similar models to change those models and make sure people are properly compensated for the work and totally discourage children from working so they can go to school.” BAT said in a statement that it took the issue of child labour very seriously and “strongly agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education”.Simon Cleverly, the group head of corporate affairs, said BAT’s core policies “specifically state that we do not condone forced, bonded or involuntary labour and that we do not condone or employ child labour, and seek to ensure that the welfare, health and safety of children are paramount at all times”.He said BAT made it clear to contract farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour and forced and bonded labour would not be tolerated.BAT leaf operations and contracted suppliers were required to participate in the industry-wide sustainable tobacco programme, he said, which was aligned with United Nations standards, including on child labour and income for farm workers.“As we have received a letter of claim relating to these allegations, it would be inappropriate for us to provide further comment at this time,” Cleverly said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d3d9f5c5283ddeaec1aa4558da2e0f75663411/0_82_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a1b8959612bab4a0790772aad1685fd","title":"conker contests and pumpkin picking autumn in the uk in pictures","story":"Keats called it the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness we call it an excellent excuse for a grand day out.

We’ve also seen how Jeremy Kyle would use provocative and sometimes abusive language towards participants in the show, and that this could be edited out of the broadcasted show.”Among other issues, the programme’s head of aftercare, Graham Stanier, is found to have been compromised by his joint role – tasked with making entertaining television and looking after participants, blurring the line between presenter and social worker.The expert advisers concluded that one element of leaked footage, where a man was punching a wall in a small room after being followed off stage by Kyle, showed that Stanier was reluctant to intervene to calm the situation down.“From a clinical perspective this is evidence of a complete abdication of the duty of care in this particular example,” the analysis concluded.The advisers to the parliamentary committee also highlight concerns about the use of inaccurate lie detectors on the programme, citing an example where a female participant berated by Kyle for failing to believe a result “seems submissive, is struggling to speak, is unable to make eye contact, and is seeking to hide away as much as possible”.“There is seemingly no safe space for her to go, which is of serious concern,” they add, suggesting “her welfare is being ignored in pursuing the interests of the show”.In response to ITV’s suggestion that programme participants were aware of the nature of the programme, which ran for 14 years on weekday mornings, the analysts conclude this is a foil to avoid criticism, saying: “The staging, presenter’s use of power dynamics and language, serve to demean and humiliate both guests on stage, whilst using the audience as collaborators in this bullying methodology.”ITV dropped The Jeremy Kyle Show earlier this year following the death of participant Steve Dymond. It has since introduced guidelines for all its reality TV shows including Love Island, while the media regulator Ofcom has substantially strengthened the broadcasting code following the cancellation of the programme – making it difficult for a similar show to be broadcast on British television in the future. Kyle remains on contract with ITV and the channel is considering new shows that he could take part in.ITV said it could not comment on leaked footage it had not seen but made clear it would not be commissioning any more programmes similar to The Jeremy Kyle Show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68ac7c2a6197fa90f9e8e6bd33ed88eb04f6f41/0_0_3074_1845/master/3074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c4fbb0936442f7e9209f2999a0fe910","title":"bohemian rhapsody producer to make bee gees biopic","story":"Graham King secures rights to Bee Gees songs, following £687m success of Queen and Freddie Mercury movieThe producer of Bohemian Rhapsody, the hit movie about the life of Freddie Mercury and Queen, is set to take on another set of musical icons: the Bee Gees.According to Deadline, Graham King is teaming with Paramount Pictures and production company Sister to create the biopic, which has not yet been written or cast.Paramount has purchased the rights to the Bee Gees songs on behalf of King, and will therefore be able to use them in the movie – unlike films including upcoming Bowie movie Stardust and Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is By My Side, which were forced to tell their stories without the music of their main characters.King scored a huge hit with Bohemian Rhapsody in 2018, which grossed £687m ($903m) at the global box office, and won Rami Malek, who plays Mercury, an Oscar for best actor. Its success, in tandem with Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born remake, has made music movies highly bankable. Elton John biopic Rocketman made £148m ($195m) for Paramount earlier this year Baz Lurhmann is preparing an Elvis Presley movie, and films about the lives of Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley and Carole King are all in development.The Bee Gees story has the requisite ups and downs: the three eldest Gibb brothers hustled up a career first in Australia, and then in the UK via Beatles manager Brian Epstein, before breaking through in the US in the late 1960s. They split up in 1970 amid fraternal spats, compounded by misuse of alcohol and drugs. Barry Gibb told the  in 2013: “There was this deep, emotional competition between three brothers that had found themselves to be famous and didn’t understand it.”But the Gibbs buried the hatchet, reformed, and ended up bigger than ever before. Songs including Stayin’ Alive, Night Fever, More Than a Woman and How Deep Is Your Love – which soundtracked the smash-hit 1977 film Saturday Night Fever – defined and indeed prolonged the disco era, and they had six successive No 1 singles in the US in less than two years. Later there would be further discord: acrimonious orces, more drug addiction, and the death of their younger brother Andy aged just 30.Maurice Gibb died in 2003, followed by his twin, Robin, in 2012.

Premiered in 1691, three years after the so-called glorious revolution established constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy in this country, Purcell’s opera aimed to bolster the Stuart dynasty by celebrating a new arcadian Britain, rising “in triumph o’er the main”. Hearing it in our politically uncertain times is inevitably fraught with irony, and when we reached the Act V drinking song, with its refrain “hoigh for the honour of Old England,” EU flags were unfurled from music stands and waved by singers and players as the audience roared its approval.The Gabrieli Consort have been performing the work for 25 years, though on this occasion they returned to it in a critical edition prepared by Christopher Suckling and McCreesh himself, which aims to reproduce the spare yet sensual sound-world heard by its first audiences. Continuo is banished from choruses and dances. A baroque trumpet peals out in moments of glory, and a solo lute accompanies How Blest Are Shepherds, where we might expect a quota of strings.Above all, though, this was an evening of joyous, wonderfully elegant music-making. Nine singers shared the songs and choruses between them, a flawless ensemble of equals, though Anna Dennis and Mhairi Lawson stood out as a seductive pair of sirens, and Dennis’s Fairest Isle was particularly ravishing. The playing, meanwhile, had everything one could wish for in its deftness, grace and lightness of touch.

He said one of Ashley’s employees had felt “forced to give birth in a warehouse toilet because she was terrified of missing her shift”. MPs have previously accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a “Victorian workhouse”, after a  undercover investigation in 2015 revealed conditions at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The investigation discovered that Shirebrook workers were receiving effective hourly pay rates below the minimum wage. Sports Direct was fined and forced to make up the underpayments.What could be done? Labour has previously proposed banning zero-hours contracts, giving workers a guaranteed minimum number of hours’ work a week, lifting the minimum wage to £10 an hour and helping to prosecute exploitative bosses, in what it called the “biggest extension of workers’ rights” in British history.The charge sheet Ineos is the biggest chemicals firm in the world and owns petrol refineries including Grangemouth in Scotland. His companies are responsible for about a third of industrial greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland, according to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. Ineos is also exploring the possibility of fracking for shale gas. At the Labour event, Corbyn asked: “Whose side are you on? The big polluters like Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man, who makes his money by polluting the environment? Or the children growing up in our cities with reduced lung capacity because of choking pollution?”What could be done? The UK has set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, and Labour wants a target of as early as the 2030s as part of a “green new deal”.After mini-earthquakes at a test drilling site in Lancashire, Labour called on the government to ban fracking, citing “fear, disruption and potential damage to property”.Who is he? Odey is the founder of Odey Asset Management and one the country’s richest financiers, with an estimated £775m fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list. He donated almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns and gave £10,000 to Boris Johnson’s campaign for the Conservative leadership.The charge sheet Odey made £220m on the night of the 2016 referendum by betting against the pound and British companies. He placed the bets after his hedge fund bought private polling data from YouGov that suggested the leave campaign would win. He gloated the next day on the BBC: “There’s that Italian expression, il mattino ha l’oro in bocca – the morning has gold in its mouth – and never has one felt so much that idea as this morning.”Labour has accused Odey of continuing to bet against the pound and British companies. Corbyn said: “Greedy bankers like Crispin Odey … make millions betting against our country.” Odey dismissed the accusation as “crap” and said his fund was neutral on its outlook for the UK economy and British businesses. What could be done? John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has demanded an inquiry into conflicts of interest among hedge funds that shorted the pound or UK shares in the run-up to a possible no-deal Brexit and donated to the Conservatives. Some countries have brought in temporary bans on short-selling of certain stocks, but it would be hard for a potential Labour government to introduce an outright ban on the practice. Financial experts said it would be easy to find a way around any restrictions by buying or selling stocks in other countries. A ban on currency trading or hedge funds would also be almost impossible as they would just shift overseas. A better option could be a tax on financial transactions, which McDonnell has backed in the past.Who is he? At 28 years old, the seventh Duke of Westminster is the the UK’s youngest billionaire and the 14th richest person in the country, with an estimated £10bn fortune. He inherited his wealth and title after the death of his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, in August 2016. The family paid no inheritance tax on the bulk of the fortune – which comes from vast property holdings across Mayfair and Belgravia – as most of the wealth had already been transferred to family trusts.The charge sheet The duke had been accused of “social cleansing” over a plan to evict 40 families from council homes in order to convert their block into posh flats. His property company Grosvenor wanted to demolish Walden House in Belgravia in order to build a new complex of high-end flats and shops. The building is owned by Grosvenor but historically has been leased to Westminster council for social housing provision. Corbyn described the duke as a “dodgy landlord” who had “tried to evict whole blocks of families to make way for luxury apartments”.What could be done? Grosvenor has said it will modify its plans and increase the proportion of affordable housing in the project. Local councils could be forced to demand more affordable homes. More generally, more could be done to tackle rogue landlords across the country by encouraging councils to take full advantage of government banning orders. In the first year of the scheme, just four landlords were placed on the database.Who is he? The 88-year-old Australian media mogul owns newspapers across the US, Australia and the UK, including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times.The charge sheet Corbyn described Murdoch as a “billionaire media baron … whose empire pumps out propaganda to support a rigged system”. His red top newspapers were at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal, which led to the closure of the News of the World.What could be done? The Labour leader has previously set out plans to set free journalists from “billionaire press barons” and democratise news in the digital age. In a speech at the Edinburgh TV festival last year, Corbyn said that without “bold, radical thinking on the future of our media … a few tech giants and unaccountable billionaires will control huge swathes of our public space and debate”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f6398f95ac30af4932d888919be068ebaaef93/0_1_3324_1994/master/3324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5987dc809bb8c687c65cbfc791b5286","title":"last order john bercows final day as speaker","story":"His throaty remarks gave him fame, but Bercow will be remembered as an innovator in the CommonsAfter just over a decade as Speaker and an estimated 14,000 throaty cries of “Order!”, it was perhaps typical of John Bercow that his final day in the Commons featured not only lengthy tributes but a brutal row with an MP conducted with his trademark icy passive-aggression.Bercow, possibly the most high-profile modern Speaker, and certainly the most interventionist and isive, had faced what was, by recent standards, a relatively low-key day in the chamber.It was during one of these – a half-hour debate on endorsing a disciplinary report on the Labour MP Keith Vaz – that Bercow found time for a final disagreement with one of his many long-time foes, Andrew Bridgen.After the Tory MP used his speech to accuse Bercow of being too lax over Vaz, the Speaker ordered Bridgen to sit down, admonishing him for “extreme folly as well as sheer nastiness”.Bridgen sarcastically thanked Bercow for his “help and advice”, but was again stopped in his tracks. “Don’t mix it with the chair,” Bercow fumed, face fixed into what Boris Johnson had half-affectionately described the day before as his “Tony Montana scowl”, a reference to Al Pacino’s character in Scarface.The paradox of this ferocious set-to was that it came almost immediately after MPs had spent slightly under three hours lavishing praise on Bercow.Some tributes were notably arch, such as when Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, assured Bercow that his much-used arcane verbs such as “chuntering” were “now in common parlance in pubs and clubs across England”.But others were hugely sincere. Rosie Duffield thanked Bercow for his kindness to her family when she was sworn in as the 2017-elected Labour MP for Canterbury, saying her father, who has Alzheimer’s, still repeatedly talks with fondness of the day.It was, overall, probably a fitting swan song for the 157th Speaker, who is standing down at December’s election after 22 years in the Commons, the first dozen as a Tory MP and shadow minister.While Bercow took over amid the furore of the MPs’ expenses scandal, his prominence has grown since the 2016 Brexit referendum, where he has proved a regular thorn in the side of government, allowing backbench MPs significant scope to shape – some critics would say obstruct – the departure process.Commons-watchers say Bercow has reshaped the role of his office, for example with the huge increase in urgent questions to ministers. “I think he’s changed the nature of the role,” said Ruth Fox, director of the parliamentary research group the Hansard Society.Bercow’s greatest impact was perhaps “in making parliament a more outward-facing institution”, Fox said, such as his work with the education centre and youth parliament.Even his notoriety must be seen in the political context of the era, she added: “He’s a Speaker who for three-quarters of his time in office has presided over a hung parliament. He’s had to make decisions at a time when political parties are fragmented, and haven’t really operated in parliament as they normally do.“We’ll only really get a sense of his record and his reputation when he’s gone and we see how his successor fares. Because if his successor faces some or all of these same challenges, we’ll see how they deal with it.“We’ll also see if backbench MPs are happy if his successor is less inclined to defend their rights and more inclined to allow the executive an easier ride.”There are, however, some more obviously troubling aspects to Bercow’s tenure. He has been accused by former aides of bullying. He vehemently denies the claims, but his departure means the investigatory process could stop.And while Bercow’s colourfully-worded put-downs might have earned him a global audience, some MPs vehemently dislike what they say can be a bullying, condescending manner in the chair.Labour’s Chris Bryant, among nine MPs seeking to replace Bercow in an election process scheduled for Monday, told the  last week he had recently walked out of the Commons chamber as he disliked the way the Speaker was chastising one Conservative.What seems clear is that whatever of Bercow’s procedural innovations remain under a new Speaker, their style will be different. It is perhaps no surprise that the two favourites are Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, both deputy Speakers, who are known quantities and significantly more understated in their approach.As for Bercow, who has three school-age children, he must now vacate the lavish apartment inside parliament that comes with the job, and at the age of 56, seek a new career.Previous Speakers have been made peers, but several government briefings have indicated that Bercow will be denied this. However, the attention-grabbing manner that perhaps played a role in this could bring an alternative path, with several reports that he will be in demand on the US lecture circuit.Lindsay Hoyle: the Labour MP for Chorley since 1997, and a deputy Speaker since 2010, he is seen as the front-runner for the post.Eleanor Laing: another deputy Speaker, Laing is a Conservative, and is MP for Epping Forest. She could pip Hoyle to the job.Chris Bryant: a popular Labour backbencher and self-professed Commons geek – he has written a two-volume history of parliament – Bryant is another possible winner.Rosie Winterton: also a deputy Speaker, since 2017, Winterton was formerly Labour’s chief whip.Harriet Harman: the longest-serving female MP and a reformer of its procedures for decades, the Labour MP has campaigned energetically but is now seen as perhaps an outsider.Meg Hillier: an east London Labour MP, she chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee.Edward Leigh: veteran Tory backbencher – he has represented Gainsborough since 1983.Henry Bellingham: a Tory of the same vintage, being MP for North West Norfolk since 1983.Shailesh Vara: yet another Conservative. MP for North West Cambridgeshire since 2005 and a former Northern Ireland minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b048f410b22a47b528b4d00c94397681111aa69/43_0_2649_1590/master/2649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1cf57e7d618684e392ce296f6fcc0eb","title":"not about me jeremy corbyn adulation general election labour","story":"Rapt audience hail Labour leader and his quasi-mystical powers at general election campaign launchThe entrance was surprisingly restrained. A mere three-minute standing ovation. First the shadow cabinet trooped on stage at the Battersea Arts Centre in south-west London and joined in the applause. Some faces familiar, others less so. A few known not even to their families. Last to appear was Jeremy Corbyn. “This isn’t about me,” he was to say several times. You could have fooled me.Here was the Labour leader in his element as he launched his party’s election campaign. In the Commons he often seems awkward, stumbling over his words as he fails to make basic arguments. But give him an enthusiastic home-team audience and he comes alive. The sentences flow with the conviction and passion of a revivalist preacher. A man with the power to convince his supporters he had won the last election even when he had lost.This was a once in a generation election to transform British politics, he insisted. Generations seem to come round awfully quickly these days, as I can distinctly remember him saying exactly the same thing during the last election in 2017. Still, no one was quibbling over these sorts of details. Having quickly dispensed with Brexit – he would negotiate a new deal within six months, which he might or might not support at a second referendum – it was all a piece of piss, really. He couldn’t imagine how Theresa May and Boris Johnson had cocked things up so badly. Corbyn moved on to his social justice agenda.He wouldn’t be selling off the NHS to the USA. This prompted massive cheers and is going to be a hard line for the Tories to counter. Because the more they say they aren’t going to flog parts of the health service to Donald Trump, the more people will suspect that is the plan, as not even Conservative voters expect Boris to tell the truth these days. After all, this was the very day, 31 October, on which the prime minister had promised to die in a ditch and he was still very much alive. Corbyn asked for a moment’s silence in solidarity with all those who had been out digging extra ditches in anticipation.Patients would be cured of cancer even before they had been diagnosed with it. There would be nurseries and schools on every street corner. The old would all have their own dedicated team of carers. Sheep would dream of electric androids. It sounded very much like the sort of world to which anyone could aspire. He didn’t say how much any of this would cost, but then he didn’t have to. In the Boris Johnson post-truth world there are no economic constraints. If the Tories can spend money they don’t have as if there is no tomorrow, why shouldn’t Labour?Having whizzed through his catchy opening verses, Corbyn moved into his middle eight chorus. This wasn’t an election of the people versus an anti-Brexit establishment elite. It was an election of the people against a Tory establishment elite. The tax-dodgers. The dodgy landlords. Those with a vested interest in preserving inequality.“Whose side are we on?” he asked.“Yours,” came the near instantaneous response.Corbyn looked mildly perplexed at this. In his script, the right answer had been for the crowd to shout out: “The people.”“Whose side are we on?” he tried again.The Labour leader shrugged. He could live with the adulation. But he was going to have to work a lot harder to sell the message that it wasn’t all about him. He raced to a close with a promise to continue fighting until the rivers froze over. Or the Red Sea parted. It wasn’t clear if this was a reference to climate change or his quasi-mystical powers. The audience assumed the latter. “Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn,” they chanted.Things became slightly edgier when questions were invited from the press. Laura Kuenssberg was heckled merely for asking why he expected Labour to win on much the same agenda as it had lost last time. Not that it had lost last time. That was all a media conspiracy. Much like the poll ratings that put Labour at its lowest levels since the 1980s. Inside the Corbyn bubble we were in the year of magical thinking.One or two members of the shadow cabinet went a little pale and their applause more hesitant when Corbyn declined to guarantee them their jobs after an election. Then the only person whose job the Labour leader could guarantee was his own. His supporters demanded nothing less. Because even if he lost, he would have won again. And even if he were to die, his spirit would be immortal.Fame! I’m gonna live forever. I’m gonna learn how to fly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac2c628c7443cd2aa1a1055724eefda1bccb3c65/563_134_2380_1428/master/2380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d7e07c69a307b2cad75ffea54b262a","title":"general election latest news brexit labour tory real change is coming says corbyn at labours campaign launch live news","story":"US president also says Corbyn would be ‘so bad for your country’ in radio interview with Nigel Farage My colleague, Rowena Mason, has just published this story on Boris Johnson’s “PR stunt” visit to a Cambridgeshire hospital, at which the prime minister was booed:Julia Simons, a 23-year-old medical student, who had confronted the prime minister, said:Staff were not informed even when he was in the hospital. He was too cowardly to face the uncensored opinions of staff because we know the reality the effects of his government’s and party’s policies on patients.A No 10 spokesman has contradicted Trump’s claim that a UK-US trade deal might not be possible under Boris Johnson’s Brexit withdrawal agreement.The PM negotiated a new deal which ensures that we take back control of our laws, trade, borders and money a deal which people said he would never negotiate. Under this new deal, the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, which means we can strike our own free trade deals around the world from which every part of the UK will benefit.Last night, my colleague Rowena Mason reported that the Tories’ election campaign was set to be run by Isaac Levido, the former right-hand man of Lynton Crosby. The PM’s de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, was not due to be centrally involved and had remained in Downing Street, she reported.This evening, she has this update:It emerged earlier this afternoon that an inquiry had concluded the £100,000 government grant given to a firm run by Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman embroiled in a conflict of interest row over her close friendship with Boris Johnson, was “appropriate”.The shadow culture secretary and Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, has now said:This ‘review’ is a complete whitewash. The documents published raise more questions than we had before. No one reading Hacker House’s grant application would give the company a penny, let alone £100,000 of tax payers’ money.The fundamental question of why Hacker House was ever given this grant remains unanswered. The public deserve to know why their money was handled so irresponsibly. We will not let this lie.I have great relationships with many of the leaders, including Boris. He’s a fantastic man and I think he’s the exact right guy for the time and I know you and him will end up doing something that could be terrific if you (Farage) and he, if you and he get together as, you know, an unstoppable force.And Corbyn would be so bad for your country. He’d be so bad, he’d take you in such a bad way. He’d take you into such bad places. But, your country has tremendous potential, it’s a great country.Trump told LBC he has got on well with both the current and former prime ministers on a personal level. Referring to the current occupant of No 10, Trump said:Oh yeah, Boris and I have a great friendship, we’ve become friends. Boris and I, when he was running they were saying: ‘He’s the Trump, he’s the Trump.’ We have a lot of the same things going, I guess.Boris is a terrific guy, you know that he’s a terrific guy. I think it was time for Boris, it was time you needed him.As some correspondents in Westminster have pointed out, this could end up playing better for Labour than for the Conservatives:Referring to his relationships with Theresa May, Trump told LBC:Well, I liked her very much. You know, I disagreed with certain things that she did but I like her she was always very nice to me, I was nice to her ... I told her exactly how to make a deal but she didn’t listen to me and that’s okay not everybody listens to me. Some people do.According to May, Trump’s advice to her was to “sue the European Union”.Trump also suggested that gossip about the US having its eyes on the NHS may have started with the Labour leader, telling LBC:I don’t even know where your healthcare system started with respect to us taking over your healthcare system. I mean it’s so ridiculous I think Corbyn put that out there.In reality, besides Trump having himself put it out there (see previous post), his ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, has also explicitly and publicly raised the prospect.On US designs on parts of the NHS, Trump told LBC:No, not at all, we wouldn’t even be involved in that no. We’re trying to fix our health service. We all have our health service problems ... No. it’s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system. No, we’re just talking about trade.The US president has previously contradicted himself on whether or not Washington would want the NHS on the table in trade talks. In June, he said:When you’re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that.Later the same day, he said:Here’s what Trump told Farage on his discussions with the prime minister over the latter’s Brexit deal:We wanna do trade with the UK and they wanna do trade with us and, to be honest with you, this deal – under certain aspects of the deal – you can’t do it, you can’t do it, you can’t trade.Trump added that the US would be barred from some parts of the UK market under Johnson’s deal a situation that he said “would be ridiculous”.Reacting to Trump’s LBC interview, the Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, has said:Donald Trump is unfit to hold the office of president of the United States. Boris Johnson is unfit to be prime minister of the United Kingdom.This endorsement is yet another example of the cuddly relationship between the two men. As the saying goes, you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep.Trump is a bully, a misogynist and a racist. Yet the Conservatives have fawned to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with him. A trade deal that would threaten food standards and our precious NHS.Liberal Democrats will continue to stand up to regressive politics and will continue to fight to stop Brexit and build a brighter future.As has been suggested elsewhere, Farage has opened himself up to claims of hypocrisy by inviting a sitting US president to intervene when the UK is preparing to vote on its future.Here’s what the Brexit party leader told Fox News in 2016 in reaction to Barack Obama saying the UK would be at the back of the queue in trade negotiations if it voted to leave the EU:Vladimir Putin behaved in a more statesmanlike manner than President Obama did in this referendum campaign. Obama came to Britain and, I think, behaved disgracefully telling us we would be at the back of the queue. Vladimir Putin maintained his silence throughout the whole campaign.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has responded to Trump’s interview with LBC, tweeting:Corbyn’s referring to Trump’s claim that the US would have no involvement in the NHS under a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal. The US president has, at different times, said the NHS would and would not be on the table in any such negotiations.Donald Trump opened his interview with LBC by again repeating his nonsense claim to have correctly predicted the result of the Brexit referendum when he opened his Turnberry golf course on 24 June 2016.The Brexit referendum was held on 23 June 2016.Trump’s interviewer, the political campaigner and Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, nodded, said “yep” and allowed the false claim to pass.That’s all from me for today.My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/825c76f187803e84cff7b1ccbb19622c1595a76a/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cea69272c07b1dc4e6ac0e1f845acaa","title":"uk general election 2019 poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead in the opinion polls as Boris Johnson seeks to turn his lead into a working parliamentary majority.

Once inside the respiratory tract, the virus penetrates immune cells that sit at the interface between the lungs and bloodstream. From there, the virus replicates and spreads to immune cells throughout the body.Previously, scientists had inferred a longer-term impact on the immune system because deaths from other infections were seen to go up after a measles outbreak, and because the virus directly attacks the immune system. The latest work for the first time uncovers the extent of the damage.The researchers recruited volunteers from three schools in the Netherlands. They took blood samples from healthy, unvaccinated children aged four to 17 and followed up with 77 of the children who were infected in a measles outbreak in 2013 for repeat sampling.The first paper, led by Velislava Petrova, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge University, says measles erodes two separate lines of defence of the immune system.To tackle previously unseen infections, the immune system relies on constantly pumping out a erse range of immune cells – thousands of different varieties, each with slightly different receptors on their surfaces, with a collective ability to recognise almost any pathogen.“The more erse range of them we have, the better,” said Petrova. However, after measles, the children had a far more restricted range.The immune system also creates long-lived memory cells, which remain permanently in circulation, allowing the body to rapidly recognise and eliminate previously encountered infections.However, after measles, a substantial proportion of immune memory cells had disappeared from the children’s blood, in what the scientists described as “immune amnesia”. This could even mean that children who become infected with measles may need to be revaccinated for previous diseases.“We show that measles directly causes the loss of protection to other infectious diseases,” said Petrova.The children in the study were followed up around six weeks after their measles infection, and so it has not yet been established how long it would take for the immune system to recover.“One can speculate that it’s very likely to recover, based on recovery seen in people on immunosuppressive drugs,” said Velislava. “Maybe after five years you would recover.”The research found that the MMR vaccine itself did not produce immune suppression, meaning that recipients get the benefit of lifelong immunity to measles infection without the damaging effects of natural infection.Petrova said that addressing scepticism around vaccines was a complex task. “We shouldn’t think that scientific data is enough to convince people,” she said. “We need to bring enough reliable information to people at the point of care. Not create polarisation in society around this.”Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, who was not involved in the work, said: “In our current climate of falling vaccine uptake rates, this serves as a timely reminder of why MMR immunisation is so important – not only to protect against the viruses the vaccine is designed to target, but also to prevent avoidable follow-on complications that can occur after measles infection.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac8b173e5e40f6840d6b036d1044399599ea67e/660_434_1307_784/master/1307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2daced8c6bc64d0631a5fbff40fe873b","title":"sophie morgan on researching her family tree we are finding a secret dark side","story":"TV presenter Morgan always had questions about her lineage.  Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

But when we played Australia we knew they’d put 40 points on us in Sydney a few months earlier. We’d played some very good rugby against them and where they had done really well was out wide. We’d missed a number of tackles on David Campese and he’d scored three tries, but without those tries the scoreline would have been a lot closer. So we thought we needed to play a more fluid game against them. It wasn’t something we were talked into – we spent the whole week working out how we were going to win the game. The consensus afterwards was we’d played all the rugby but we didn’t nail the key moments. Back in the dressing rooms, Australia were almost too exhausted to celebrate. They had literally spent the entire second half defending.We were still trying to come to terms with the defeat, and how we should feel after losing such a match at our own ground, when we left Twickenham, but there were hundreds of people singing Jerusalem as we walked to the coach. I felt it was a real acknowledgement we’d been part of something really special. We had no doubt we could win. There was no lack of belief, and we came into it riding some good momentum. On the day, we left it all out there. We gave it everything.We had been on a five-and-a-half-week tour of Australia and Fiji, then we went home for a few days, before having seven weeks for the World Cup. We weren’t able to see our wives and girlfriends during the competition, so we’d been away from our homes and our jobs for months. I was a banker at UBS at the time and I turned up at the office on the Monday. There were 750 people on my trading floor and when I walked in they all stood up and applauded. We hadn’t won but that showed me that we hadn’t failed. My boss took me to one side and suggested I go away with the family for a few weeks, but I hadn’t worked for months. I politely declined his offer.Obviously rugby is a profession now but when you think about the values of the game and the human elements of it, that hasn’t changed. Or if it has, it hasn’t necessarily been for the better. I had a sympathetic employer and a job to go back to, whereas now if you get forced out of the game through injury you’ve got nothing. We need to look after our people and we’ve got work to do on that. But the sport has been absolutely fantastic. It was wonderful to see Japan play the sort of rugby that needs to be played teams who have not embraced that – Ireland perhaps – have come unstuck. England, though, have set the standard. The way they played that semi-final against New Zealand was game-changing. It’s been a huge success and a lot of these teams will get better. I’m chairman now of European Professional Club Rugby and, watching the tournament, I think it’s been a wonderful shot in the arm for the game worldwide.Preparation-wise, you’re not really going to get any fitter in that final week and you’re probably not going to be going through any great tactical changes, it’s just about managing all the micro-details and arriving in the best possible physical and mental state. You can drain so much energy out of yourself just thinking about the occasion.None of us had ever been to a final before and I remember the conversations I had that week with family members and with all the guys. I always liked positive distractions – I liked having family and friends around, talking about something different, going into spaces and worlds where you relax. And of course by that time we’d been through so many ups and downs together as a team, as all teams do. You get all these emotions rolling up. But everyone’s different and you’ve got to learn how to get the best out of yourself. I remember Jonny Wilkinson, his preparation was very calm. He’s got to be thinking about the pinpoint dot on a rugby ball. I’m thinking there’s a loosehead prop forward who wants to tear my head off.I used to love playing away from home. You found out more about yourself and your teammates, somehow. Not that it’s easy at home, but when you’re away you find out what you’re made of. I always think that’s the greatest test of yourself as a human being. The 2003 final was the perfect example: you’re in Australia, in their national stadium, in Sydney, playing the host nation in a World Cup final. Bloody hell, come on.Everyone has this perception about how well we were playing in 2003 but the reality is we didn’t play that well – we just won. We were losing at half-time against Wales in the quarter-final, and in the semi‑final Jonny kicked every point. In the final we went to extra time and won it with a right-footed drop-goal by a left-footed kicker. We weren’t dominant, we just did what needed to be done.You have all this buildup – the waiting, the waiting, the waiting – and then suddenly you walk out of the tunnel. You feel you’re in a surreal bubble, and then the whistle goes and before you know it it’s over. It goes so, so quickly. This England team have guys who have played in big matches, in big tournaments but the World Cup seems to amplify all those things. They’ve got to be the side who handles the occasion better.This year’s team set a new standard in the semi-finals but they will be thinking they can still be a bit better, be a bit smarter, maybe improve their kicking game. The driver on Saturday is they want to be world champions. The All Blacks game hasn’t changed that: the goal, the purpose, the motivation is exactly the same as it was when they arrived in Japan. It’s just about nailing those micro-details, one last time.I’d made my debut in the Six Nations earlier that year, aged 28. It was a dream come true, especially so late in my life. I had a couple of Six Nations games, toured South Africa, then we got to the World Cup and in our second game we were absolutely hosed by South Africa. We lost 36-0 and were staring down the barrel of being completely embarrassed.That was a Friday night. Brian Ashton told us to spend Saturday with our families and that we’d come together on the Sunday. We were expecting a crisis meeting but instead it was off to the pub for a bit of bonding – table football, pool, darts, the rugby on TV. It was: “Right lads, enjoy yourselves, this is on the RFU. Tomorrow we get to work.” On Monday we had the meeting. Some home truths were told. It’s well documented that a number of senior players took control and said: “This is how we’re going to play.” The previous three months had been good from a fitness point of view but from a rugby point of view it was wasted time.We had some experienced players there and you can adapt very quickly when you need to. We got through a couple of tough pool games against Samoa and Tonga. From the outside we still weren’t rated but as a group we were much happier. We bonded well and a siege mentality formed regarding what was written about us.We were completely written off before our quarter-final against Australia. It only ended 12-10, but we battered them. That was a turning point and our belief got even stronger. We were probably underdogs for a semi-final against the hosts but confidence and team spirit were high and we got through it. Suddenly we’re in the World Cup final, against the opposition who embarrassed us in the group stages. Here was an opportunity to right those wrongs.You go into the final, and you know it’s your one shot at creating memories for the rest of your life. Ultimately it was a step too far but it was close. But for a disallowed try and a couple of silly penalties, we could have done it. The loss will never go away – it still hurts now – but when I look back, that World Cup was my most enjoyable time in international rugby.Over a World Cup you build this rapport, this trust on the field with world-class players either side of you, but then you lose the final and suddenly you’re back home, and you have to wait two months to do it again. They’ll find it strange when they get back but you can’t overestimate how much this England side has improved because of having this time together. Now they’ve got one more experience to go through.From the outside, and talking to a few people close to the group, they’re getting everything right. England have always had big players in the pack but we’ve been found wanting in the breakdown, especially against the southern hemisphere teams. In the last two weeks, teams who usually school us in that area have been schooled themselves. Plus most of these guys have experience, they’ve got that hurt from the last World Cup, and you can’t put a price on how much that will drive true, competitive animals. You could see their focus at the end of the semi-final. When we beat France we were doing a lap of honour, hugging each other. These guys thanked the fans and then it was: “Job done, now let’s bring that trophy home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd25aa7c53e73c4adb6e2a5a5fd5e1064ee22f/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39cd5db6011cc99e3f3015b3684a9977","title":"rugby world cup final watching win england south africa","story":"England and South Africa face off in Yokohama on Saturday.

For the first time in any major North American sport, the visiting team won all seven games of a best-of-seven playoff series. Wednesday’s series finale marked the Nationals’ record fifth comeback win in a potential elimination game in the postseason. It was thrilling stuff on paper, yet Major League Baseball has battled a host of bad press and unwanted storylines throughout the series.The first five games were mostly dreary, lopsided affairs lacking the tense and unpredictable moments that draw casual sports fans toward baseball, a sport failing to keep pace with the immense popularity of the NFL and NBA. Instead of the game action, the storylines permeating the World Series media cycle involved insensitivity to domestic violence, the appropriateness of booing the President of the United States and sluggish pace of play that hindered television ratings.The Nationals may not have saved baseball from the distractions that revealed the unseemly truths facing the sport, but their victory over one of the best teams in baseball history offered a respite from a glut of unwanted press that dominated the playoffs.For the first three games, the public focused on a fiasco involving the Astros and Sports Illustrated reporter Stephanie Apstein. Apstein reported that Houston assistant general manager Brandon Taubman shouted “I’m so fucking glad we got Osuna!” at three female reporters, one of whom was wearing a purple domestic violence awareness bracelet. That was in reference to pitcher Roberto Osuna, a player who served a 75-game suspension while a member of the Toronto Blue Jays after violating the league policy for domestic assault. (Osuna allegedly assaulted the mother of his three-year-old child, but the charges were dropped after she returned to Mexico and declined to testify.)After declining to respond to Apstein, the Astros publicly stated that the story was fabricated. Multiple reporters confirmed Apstein’s account of the events and the team issued subsequent statements, none of which apologized to Apstein and instead focused on the organization’s dedication to domestic violence awareness. Those offerings didn’t quiet the public’s distaste for a malicious attempt to smear a reporter, and the team eventually apologized and retracted the original statement after a tone-deaf press conference from general manager Jeff Luhnow and a letter from owner Jim Crane.The Nationals’ improbable victory may have relieved commissioner Rob Manfred, who handed the championship trophy to maybe the most likable team of the postseason instead of the one whose owner and general manager caused the titanic public relations crisis that distracted from the sport’s marquee event.Between the lines, the Astros are a nearly perfect baseball team. They became only the sixth team in major league history to finish with more than 100 wins a third consecutive seasons. They also feature some of the brightest talents in the sport. Second baseman Jose Altuve became just the seventh player in history to hit a walk-off home run to clinch a pennant, starting pitcher Gerrit Cole compiled one of the most brilliant runs of any starting pitchers in baseball’s annals, and the team dominated virtually every offensive category throughout the season. To witness Houston play baseball is to watch an evolution in power pitching, deft game management and execution.It wasn’t until the postseason that the team’s cutting-edge and calculating front office proved the dangers of an increasingly pervasive mentality across baseball that winning solves everything. The Taubman scandal may have shocked the general public, but it confirmed the suspicions of Houston’s competitors: this was not an innovative underdog that built an empire instead, the Astros were a ruthless and arrogant front office whose addiction to winning triggered an avoidable and embarrassing scandal.The controversy of the Taubman affair quieted after Game 3, but even the negative press didn’t boost lagging ratings. Through five games, the series was on track to be the lowest-rated in history (11.59m average viewers compared to the 12.34m in 2012, the current low). Viewership increased in each game and peaked at 15.31m in Game 6 and likely increased for Wednesday night’s Game 7. The gains were encouraging, but – as is par for the course – Sunday night’s NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs still dwarfed Game 5, the highest viewed game at that point in the series, by roughly six million viewers according to Nielsen.Game 5 also featured Donald Trump being aggressively booed by the home crowd in DC, launching a discussion about public civility instead of Houston’s comeback from 2-0 down to lead the series 3-2. Surprisingly, Trump did not tweet about the poor welcome in the nation’s capital, but the moment spilled from sports channels into the cable news airwaves. Again, the action on the field was forgotten by a sideshow. Perhaps it was the running time of every game – six of the seven ran over three-and-a-half hours after starting at 8.08pm on the east coast – that invited the distraction.To echo Smoltz, maybe it was the unlikely path of the final two games that helped save the series. At the very least, it may have distracted from the drama that surrounded it. An umpiring controversy in Game 6 thankfully didn’t swing the outcome (though it did lead to the rare ejection of a manager, Washington’s Dave Martinez), but showed that even baseball’s highly structured and exacting rule book is subject to the replay review and technical interpretations that infuriate viewers in football, soccer and basketball.The gaudy home run celebrations of Houston’s Alex Bregman and Washington’s Juan Soto invited mindless, overwrought conversations about baseball’s unwritten rules of professionalism while the lead swings in both Games 6 and 7 provided the kind of entertainment that MLB hoped for from the outset. By the series’ conclusion, fans will likely remember the vigor of the 21-year-old Soto, the unflappable pitching of World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg and the joy of a Nationals team that couldn’t win a playoff series until this year despite four postseason appearances from 2012 through 2018.With a wealth of marketable young talent – Soto, Bregman and Carlos Correa are all 25 or younger – and a game increasingly driven by power and athleticism, baseball still remains behind football and basketball in its American and worldwide appeal. Some of the drama that surrounded the series was avoidable (Taubman), some of it will require structural fixes (pace of play).The series ended in a way for so many to enjoy, but the issues harming the sport’s popularity were evident. Games 6 and 7 were the kinds of viewing experiences that may turn casual fans into devoted ones, but they may think twice if they stomached the first five."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3225711223de0e2d1a0d3cbd39afc222f104f0/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f454a7b832b9fab9b351bd5e16ed8489","title":"two major london theatres reject funds from sackler trust","story":"Roundhouse and Donmar Warehouse turn down money deriving from painkiller linked to opioid crisis in the USTwo leading theatres have turned down funding from the Sackler Trust – including a £1m donation that had been offered to London’s Roundhouse – in the latest fallout from claims linking the Sackler family fortune to the US opioid drug crisis.The Roundhouse was listed as having received the grant last year in company accounts filed early in October by the trust, but has now revealed that it decided not to take the money because it would distract from its work with young people.Another institution, the Donmar Warehouse, told the  on Thursday that it had decided to terminate a funding agreement to receive the rest of a £180,000 grant after an initial £60,000 instalment was received last December.The developments came after the National Portrait Gallery earlier this year become the first major art institution to give up a grant from the Sackler family, in a move that campaigners hailed as a landmark victory in the battle over the ethics of arts funding.Dame Theresa Sackler, the chair of the trust, subsequently announced that it would be temporarily suspending all new philanthropic giving, while continuing to honour existing commitments.The move came after US activists had continued to step up pressure on galleries and museums funded by the Sacklers and after Theresa Sackler and other family members faced legal action in the US. Much of the wealth of some members of the family has come from one product: OxyContin, the prescription painkiller launched in 1996 that has been a major aggravator in the opioid crisis that is killing more than 100 people a day in the US.In a statement first reported by the Art Newspaper, a spokesperson for the Roundhouse said: “We are enormously grateful for the trust’s support over the years, but we have made a decision not to accept the donation at this time. To do so risks distracting from our work with young people, and that’s our priority.”Aside from the Roundhouse, the trust’s accounts for 2018 also stated that the next largest grants last year were allocated to the Young Vic (£375,000), the Old Vic (£350,000) and Chelsea and Westminster hospital (£250,000).Other listed recipients included the Borne Foundation, which supports research to prevent premature births and was recorded as receiving a £150,000 grant.A spokesperson for the Donmar Warehouse told the  that it had received a three-year grant from the Sackler Trust in 2018 and had used a first instalment of £60,000 in December to complete a programme of educational activity that it had been committed to this year.“We have not received any further funds from the trust since 2018. The Donmar board made a decision to terminate the funding agreement prior to the next instalment becoming due.”In a statement issued earlier this year, Theresa Sackler said: “I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.“The current press attention that these legal cases in the United States is generating has created immense pressure on the scientific, medical, educational and arts institutions here in the UK, large and small, that I am so proud to support. This attention is distracting them from the important work that they do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef652203abc1d895f617209576c67b080ae3c9e/533_487_3889_2334/master/3889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9e3faf83141c78a5e716a387cd65c3","title":"google pixel 4 review battery life camera","story":"Brilliant camera, slick features and small size mean nothing when the phone won’t even last a dayGoogle is one of only a handful of smartphone manufacturers still making flagship phones that aren’t ginormous beasts, with the new Pixel 4 the cheapest in a while that significantly undercuts the competition.Priced at £669, the Pixel 4 is £70 cheaper than last year’s Pixel 3 and £60 cheaper than Apple’s iPhone 11.

The Pixel 4 only lasts just over 14 hours between charges. Remove it from the charger at 7am and it will be dead by 9pm. Turning off the bells and whistles such as the ambient display only added about 40 minutes to the battery life. Anything under 24 hours simply is not good enough, particularly given I didn’t play any games or do anything particularly battery-draining.That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, two hours of browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and three photos.For comparison, similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro lasts 32 hours and the Pixel 4 XL lasts 26 hours under similar conditions, while the majority of smartphones in 2019 can last at least 24 hours with heavy usage.The Pixel 4 is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, complete with system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation. At least three years of software updates from the phone’s release are included and it will get Android version updates before most other devices.The Pixel 4 also has the same new on-device natural language processing that was so impressive on the larger Pixel 4 XL. Google Assistant is much faster and works without an internet connection for many tasks. Google’s voice transcription app is equally excellent, as is the Live Caption feature.The new Assistant still doesn’t work with Google’s own commercial G Suite accounts though, which is a bit of a blunder. Google says it’s still working on a fix.Motion Sense uses radar to track motions around the phone. It lights up the ambient screen when you’re within 60cm, will silence calls or snooze alarms when you reach for the phone, and skip music tracks when you swipe in mid-air above it. The technology is more impressive than the functionality currently.Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new Face Unlock using 3D face recognition technology similar to Apple’s Face ID.It’s seriously fast and worked through polarised sunglasses just fine. Look at the phone and it’ll unlock, skipping the lockscreen and taking you straight back into the last thing you were doing. Although technically you don’t need to actually look at it, as it’ll unlock with your eyes closed, which might be a problem for some. Google says it’ll add the option to require attention at a later date.The biggest issue is that most third-party apps do not recognise Face Unlock, meaning without a fingerprint scanner they just assume the Pixel 4 doesn’t have a biometric input forcing you back to entering pins or passwords, which is tedious.To use Face Unlock developers need to update their apps to support the new unified biometric system built into Android, with only a small handful having done so currently. For those that have done, such as LastPass, using Face Unlock is a seamless experience – just as Face ID is on an iPhone.Given Monzo is saying it will take a while to implement, you can probably forget your traditional banking apps working soon.Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the new dual-camera system on the back of the Pixel 4 is no different. It’s the same camera as that fitted to the Pixel 4 XL and performs the same.That is to say it has fantastic still image quality, even in very difficult lighting conditions. Google is still the market leader with its Night Sight ultra-low light mode, but others have caught up considerably. New for this year is the ability to independently adjust the brightness of the background and foreground, which works very well. Portrait mode is improved, as is the up to 8x zoom thanks to the extra camera on the back. The selfie camera is relatively wide angle and pretty good, too.Not so good is video capture, which caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second, not the 60fps rivals manage.The Google Pixel 4 costs £669 ($799) with 64GB or £769 ($899) with 128GB of storage.The Google Pixel 4 is a potentially great phone hampered by really poor battery life. It doesn’t really matter how good you make a phone if it dies before the day is out.And that’s a real shame as there aren’t that many manufacturers making fully-featured flagship smartphones in smaller sizes.The screen is good and big enough. The camera is amazing. Motion Sense is novel and Face Unlock is seriously fast. The on-device natural language understanding is next level and Google’s software magic is thoroughly impressive.But the Pixel 4 suffers from the same issues with G Suite, limited scenarios in which the screen works at 90Hz, lack of third-party app support for Face Unlock and no gaze-requirement for unlocking the phone as the Pixel 4 XL.Even a comparatively lower cost of £669 isn’t enough to save the Pixel 4. If only Google had given it a bigger battery the Pixel 4 could have been one of the best smartphones on the market. Instead this feels like Google’s iPhone 7 moment – a great phone ruined by terrible battery life.Cons: terrible battery life, poor third-party app support for Face unlock, Face unlock needs eyes-open fix, Google Assistant needs G Suite fix This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But Twitter’s political advertising operation had just 21 advertisers across the entirety of the EU during the parliamentary elections this year, according to the site’s transparency report.The Twitter co-founder and chief executive, Jack Dorsey, has turned a weakness into a strength, cutting off a minuscule revenue stream in order to heap pressure on his main competitor. In the hours since Twitter’s announcement, support has come from voices as erse as the US-based campaign group Muslim Advocates, the Open Knowledge Foundation thinktank and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.Madihha Ahussain, of Muslim Advocates, commended Dorsey for “acknowledging the serious problem of political misinformation and for not-so-subtly rebuking Facebook’s reckless political ad policy”. The chief executive of the Open Knowledge Foundation, Catherine Stihler, said Twitter’s decision was “very welcome” and called on Facebook to act on “growing demands for greater transparency”. She said: “It is imperative that we do not allow disinformation to blight this year’s UK general election, forthcoming elections across Europe, and next year’s US presidential election.”Sorkin, writing in the New York Times, criticised Mark Zuckerberg for enabling the “crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together”. The screenwriter behind The Social Network, a film about Facebook’s early years, joined in a chorus of criticism of the site’s policy of explicitly allowing misinformation in political adverts.“Right now, on your website, is an ad claiming that Joe Biden gave the Ukrainian attorney general a billion dollars not to investigate his son. Every square inch of that is a lie and it’s under your logo. That’s not defending free speech, Mark, that’s assaulting truth,” he wrote.“You and I want speech protections to make sure no one gets imprisoned or killed for saying or writing something unpopular, not to ensure that lies have unfettered access to the American electorate.”Dorsey’s move was perfectly timed to increase the pressure on Facebook: he announced the policy just an hour before Zuckerberg held a conference call to announce Facebook’s quarterly results.Dorsey’s move also brought some criticism. Donald Trump’s digital campaign chief, Brad Parscale, called the move “yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives”, saying in a statement that it was “a very dumb decision” made because “Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online programme ever known”.The company also faced criticism on the details after it confirmed that the ban would apply not just to adverts for political candidates but also to ones that touch on issues of “national importance”, including climate change, healthcare and immigration.But the small scale of political advertising on Twitter should help the company avoid the bulk of the criticism. Across the whole of the EU, just 21 advertisers, none from the UK, ran political adverts during the regulated period of the EU parliamentary elections, according to information on Twitter’s site. Facebook, by contrast, has taken more than £300,000 in the last week from just the top 10 British political advertisers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53891fe3a3e3ca4d07a8c422833afbf3b2a891cd/0_104_5684_3411/master/5684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a113eb41baa1dcf3da565317c7577da","title":"best streaming service mp3 pays artists","story":"Robert still listens to MP3s but wants wants to know which music service pays artists bestI’m a big music fan and enjoy listening to music through my PC and phone, but I feel stuck in the last century as I still listen to my MP3 collection. I refuse to get Spotify, as it’s such a bad deal for the artists. Are there any alternatives that treat the artist well? RobertYour problem is that you don’t really have a problem. I’m in almost exactly the same position, only slightly worse, because I still use an MP3 player to listen to albums in MP3 format. The main difference is that I’m almost completely happy about not using any music streaming services. They are not obligatory. If you don’t need them, don’t use them. Spend the money on downloads or CDs instead.As always, there is no universal answer because it depends on all sorts of factors. These include the kinds of music you enjoy, how you listen to it, and why you listen to it.Streaming music services are very good for people who like popular music and are singles-oriented. (Yes, I know you can listen to albums. Most people don’t.) They also provide playlists that are much like thematic replacements for live radio or, as we used to call it, background music. Apart from Today’s Top Hits on Spotify, there are playlists of happy songs to wake up to, relaxing music to unwind to, party music to dance to, music to go with various types of exercise, music to fall asleep to plus any number of genre-specific playlists.Streaming music services may have limited appeal for classical music or jazz fans who are album or even box set oriented, and who care deeply about knowing who is playing what, when and how. That’s me.For example, Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded Beethoven’s nine symphonies four times and they are different, even though they sometimes have the same soloists in the ninth. Simon Rattle’s set with the Vienna Philharmonic is even more different. It’s the same for versions of The Messiah, Bach’s St Matthew Passion and any opera you can think of. As far as I can tell, streaming music services just don’t care about this kind of thing, except when someone like Ed Sheeran releases half a dozen different versions of the same song.Having said that, I did like Pandora’s streaming music service, and would still use had it not been withdrawn from the UK market. Pandora lets you create your own radio station by seeding it with something you like. I had a William Orbit station, and Pandora’s algorithms surfaced all sorts of fascinating stuff by musicians I had (mostly) never heard before. It was brilliant. For those fully on-board with Spotify, its algorithmic Discover Weekly playlist can be a source of similar inspiration for both new and old music, but it requires you listen to everything through the service and invest time in liking or disliking songs to teach it what you want.Today’s mainstream radio stations are deliberately bad at music discovery, because they know listeners will switch over if they don’t keep hearing the same familiar stuff. That leaves a hole that streaming services could fill, if only they were as good as Pandora. In theory, specialised playlists can do the job, but finding them can feel like more work than it’s worth.Streaming music services are notorious for paying minuscule amounts for playing songs, and several major artists have not joined or removed their music in protest. Whether the payments are good or bad depends to some extent on how you look at it: they are not good if they are replacing download sales, but not so bad if they’re replacing radio plays. However, all the major services have been losing money, and most probably still are. Even Spotify, the biggest and richest service with 80 million paying subscribers, would struggle to pay significantly more.Digital Music News has tried to establish how much various music services pay for streaming. According to its analysis, Napster pays the highest rate at $0.019 per stream, followed by Jay-Z’s Tidal at $0.0125 and Apple at $0.00735 per stream. YouTube pays the lowest rate of only $0.00069 per stream. Spotify is now, it seems, somewhere in the middle ground, paying about $0.00437 per stream.That isn’t a lot of money for most of the artists with music on Spotify, because 10,000 plays only pays $43.70. However, a song that gets 10m streams will earn $43,700, and big hits can earn a lot. Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You has been streamed more than 2bn times, which would be worth $8.74m at current rates. Three other Sheeran songs have been streamed more than a billion times, according to Wikipedia’s list.Another benefit is that singles can stick around earning money for years after they would have gone out of stock at record shops. A successful artist with a back catalogue of half a dozen albums on Spotify – perhaps 50 or more tracks – could do quite well, especially if their music fits easily on popular playlists. In other words, your grandmother might like it.Spotify’s stated aim “is to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work”. That would be nice. However – as with sales of records, blockbuster movies, books, YouTube videos and so on – the bulk of the money goes to the people with the biggest hits.So, if your musical tastes favour mainstream pop, you shouldn’t worry too much about Spotify’s pay rates. Every time you stream a song by Ed Sheeran, Drake, Justin Bieber, Adele, Ariana Grande and so on then you are “voting” their songs up the charts. The higher they go, the more people will play them, and the more money these superstars will make.But if your tastes are relatively, or even absolutely, obscure, then you should find other ways to support your favourite artists. Even if you never play any songs by Ed Sheeran et al, Spotify is going to send them your money. The “minor artists” you are playing will get almost none of it.As a result, the vast majority of musicians are not making enough to live on from streaming, but they shouldn’t expect to. As with radio plays, their best hope is to attract an audience. They can do that on a music service like Spotify – Justin Bieber did it on YouTube, Billie Eilish on SoundCloud – without having to go via record labels, DJs and other gatekeepers. After that, they can create their own communities, like Amanda Palmer, the Grateful Dead or Lady Gaga.The best way to support musicians you care about is to buy their albums on CD or digitally from Bandcamp, go to their concerts, buy their merchandise, join their fan clubs, follow them on Instagram, subscribe to their Patreons, and so on. That way, they will get far more of your cash than they would get from Spotify and similar services. Better than that, they will feel their work is appreciated, which is what most artists actually want.Have you got a question?

Czech transparency campaigners say they have found evidence he remains the ultimate beneficial owner, in breach of EU law.Agrofert has described the claims as false, while Babiš dismissed them as “lies” and “nonsense”. He has always maintained the company is in a private trust fund and he has not broken any law.The legal case partly rests on the view of the EU’s in-house lawyers, who concluded in a leaked legal report that the “impartial and objective exercise of his functions as a prime minister” were “compromised”.“Babiš will approve principles of EU subsidies and at the same he will be one of the biggest beneficiaries.” The European council – unlike other EU bodies such as the European commission or the European parliament – lacked “any guidance or principles on the conflict of interest”, the liberal senator added.“Do we have different rules in place for prime ministers, presidents, than other citizens of the European Union? It’s also about the rule of law, European laws should be for all of us or not. If they do not follow the rule of law then what will happen – democracy will decrease,” he said.The European court of justice has yet to confirm if it will accede to Wagenknecht’s request for a fast-track procedure, to allow a ruling before EU leaders settle the next European budget in 2020.EU insiders hope for a settlement on the 2021-27 budget by June 2020, but finding a compromise is likely to test EU unity to the limit. The erosion of the rule of law in central European countries that are the largest beneficiaries of EU funds is one reason why the financial settlement will be so hard to agree.MEPs are also concerned about the use of EU funds in Hungary, as friends, family and supporters of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, have won EU-funded government contracts facing little competition – a red flag for anti-corruption campaigners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/992f06db764fb2a22634b04b5e8b87d998369ff6/24_0_2176_1305/master/2176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46c612a8449ee16747dc05662dac0655","title":"islamic state new leader abu bakr al baghdadi abu ibrahim al hashimi al qurayshi","story":"Terror group confirms death of Baghdadi and says he has been replaced by Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-QurayshiIslamic State has confirmed the death of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and named Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi as his replacement.Baghdadi and the terror organisation’s spokesman, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, were both killed in US operations in northern Syria at the weekend.The group’s media arm, Amaq, made the announcements in an audio recording released on Thursday.News of Baghdadi’s successor had been widely anticipated among the ranks of the terror organisation following the weekend raid that traced Baghdadi to a remote corner of northern Syria after a hunt ning more than half a decade.Little is known about al-Hashimi, although his last name (al-Qurayshi) suggests that he, as did Baghdadi, claims a lineage to the Prophet Muhammad, a position that offered legitimacy in some quarters.The recording offers no information about the new leader, whose name was not among those mooted in the days since the US raid. It calls on supporters to follow Baghdadi’s directives and threatens western countries.“America, don’t you realise that the Islamic State is now at the forefront of Europe and West Africa? It is extended from the East to the West,” it says.“Don’t you see that you have become a laughing stock to the world? Your destiny is controlled by an old fool who goes to sleep with one opinion and wakes up with another. Do not celebrate or get arrogant.”Baghdadi’s death in northern Syria, a long way from where it all began for the Islamic State and its forerunners in the deserts of Iraq, was the latest in a series of blows for the group. It has been stripped of all the land it once held and has lost nearly all its founding leaders after more than five years of war.The direction of the organisation is now largely up to a new generation of leaders, who must determine whether to pursue the goals set out by Baghdadi, or set a new course. Central to the debate is whether to continue with the insurgency that made it such a lethal presence in the region, or to boost affiliates elsewhere in the world. Groups had pledged fealty to Isis in recent years as as the terror group grew in influence.Isis’s capacity to launch spectacular terror attacks in Europe and beyond is thought to have been diminished by the gruelling war that drastically eroded its ranks and leadership.While so-called lone-wolf attacks remain a constant threat, European intelligence agencies believe that efforts to disrupt the Isis’s capability to launch sophisticated attacks have been largely successful.Isis’s watertight secrecy and aversion to digital technology has made it difficult to penetrate. But Baghdadi’s demise was thought to have been brought about by at least one source from within his inner circle – a development that will alarm the new crop of Isis leaders. Kurds in Syria, and Iraqi intelligence officials, had learned of Baghdadi’s whereabouts after cultivating human sources over many months. That led to the discovery of Baghdadi’s hideout in the unlikely location of Idlib."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70653619e5ed658b8afa168edfff1adfaeef2b44/0_320_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a39543ded459e4cebb4352206eeaac96","title":"mount everest lhakpa sherpa climbed nine times world record","story":"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.In an era where many organizations profess a desire to ersify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.In 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple orced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”As we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.She also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2c6f069b9945398d50cf581ac0b8164b9c1c69/0_14_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=962e443060a206c2aabd9a2fa40e4221","title":"us strikes deal malaysian fugitive jho low 1mdb","story":"Malaysian financier will forfeit luxury boutique hotel in Beverly Hills and properties in New York and London valued at $700mThe US justice jepartment has struck a deal with the fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low to recoup close to $1bn of money taken from the investment fund 1MDB – the largest sum recovered by the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative established a decade ago to counter international corruption.Low, who is believed to be living in China and remains subject to an Interpol red alert, is accused of orchestrating the theft of $4.4bn from 1MDB, a development fund connected to Malaysia’s then prime minister, Najib Razak.The agreement, which must still be rubber-stamped by a federal judge on 11 November, does not include an admission of wrongdoing. Nor does it release Low from other criminal charges in connection with the 1MDB case.In addition to $260m of assets seized from Low earlier this year, he will reportedly forfeit a luxury boutique hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and properties in New York and London valued at $700m.Some of the funds from 1MDB, which was set up to bring economic development to benefit Malaysia’s poor, have already been returned, including $140m from the sale of a stake in New York’s Park Lane hotel.The US attorney Nick Hanna said that the agreement, which was reported by the justice department on Wednesday, showed that US anti-money laundering controls were effective.“The message in this case is simple: the United States is not a safe haven for pilfered funds,” Hanna said in a statement.The settlement resolves one aspect of a complex case that reached into the highest levels of Malaysian political circles, Wall Street and Hollywood. Two years ago, federal prosecutors alleged that 1MDB funds were channeled to numerous associates of Najib, who was himself accused of receiving $681m from 1MDB – a claim he has denied.One of the largest beneficiaries of the scheme was Low, who is alleged to have embarked on an eye-popping spending spree, including luxury apartments in Manhattan, mansions in Los Angeles, paintings by Monet and a corporate jet.According to the justice department, the theft was ided in three separate phases: an initial $1bn was taken under the “pretence of investing in a joint venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi”.The participants then raised $1.4bn through a Goldman Sachs bond issue that was deposited with a Swiss offshore company. Finally, another Goldman Sachs bond issue produced $1.3bn that was erted to an account in Singapore.The scheme became headline news after more than $100m was used to fund the production budget of Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street via Riza Aziz, stepson of Najib.At the center of it all was 34-year-old Low Taek Jho, known as Jho Low, who’d already made waves as the alleged purchaser of Picasso’s Women of Algiers for $179m. In pursuit of a lavish lifestyle, Low surrounded himself with celebrities, including the Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio, Paris Hilton and Jamie Foxx.It was reported that three months after shooting on The Wolf of Wall Street began, Aziz’s Red Granite, the production house that financed the film, spent $600,000 for the Oscar statuette given to Marlon Brando for best actor in On the Waterfront – a gift for DiCaprio.In January, DiCaprio was reported to have given secret testimony to a Washington, DC, grand jury over his role in the scandal. A spokesperson for the actor said he was cooperating with the investigation and was “entirely supportive of all efforts to assure that justice is done in this matter”.The 1MDB scheme came to light when the Sarawak Report, a UK-based site run by a former BBC journalist, published a series of what it claimed were internal emails between 1MDB and the Saudi energy company PetroSaudi.That focused the attention of US, UK and France prosecutors on Low, while regulators looked to the involvement of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sach’s south-east Asia chairman, Tim Leissner.Leissner pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges last year and agreed to forfeit $43.7m.Goldman has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with the bond offerings and maintains Leissner was not sanctioned.But with Low’s settlement, prosecutors’ attention will now probably turn to Goldman, which is cooperating with the investigation. The bank has already set aside $516m to cover potential legal penalties but has said it expects to pay as much as $2bn in penalties.“For Leissner’s role in that fraud, we apologize to the Malaysian people,” chief executive David Solomon said earlier this year before stalled settlement negotiations restarted.One of those set to benefit from the settlement is former New Jersey governor Chris Christie whose law firm represents Low. The agreement allows for $15m to be paid to Low’s advisors, including Christie, from funds recovered Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, estimated to be worth $415m.“It is one of the largest civil forfeiture settlements in US history and represents a voluntary return of each and every asset claimed by DOJ,” Christie said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dacc5d00d93a64ab25129c8b9358d2f3af5a85/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed5174b5b30a6617af3be7fbc38e05e","title":"the women who broke the harvey weinstein story podcast","story":"When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo.

The two had never spoken before, but Kantor was working on a story and needed Twohey’s help. It was an investigation into the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. What they uncovered became one of the biggest stories of our times, launching a global movement.  Rachel Humphreys talks to the journalists about how they convinced prominent actors and former Weinstein employees to speak to them, the lengths Weinstein was willing to go to in an attempt to prevent the story from becoming public, and what more needs to be done about sexual harassment in the workplace.

Photograph: Patrick Browne  Among the 2,457 graduates at Waterford Institute of Technology this week, 82-year-old Tom Boyle was the proudest of the lot.“It’s something I hadn’t achieved and it’s something I wanted to achieve,” he told The .“I actually passed first year of UCC in 1959 but left it because of work pressures. I had a few different careers and went to England like everyone else at the time.”He later worked as a taxi driver for 20 years before deciding to return to education, something that he wishes he had done ten or 20 years ago.One of Ireland’s oldest full-time undergraduates, he completed his Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in English and Irish.Having initially started his studies at WIT as a law student prior to transferring to arts, he was joined at the ceremony by his wife Phyllis and their seven children.“My wife was so supportive and so helpful to me, without her help I couldn’t have done it to be honest,” he said.To make it to his lectures, he set off at ten past six every morning from his home in Ramsgrange, Co Wexford, taking the ferry at Ballyhack village across into Passage East and on towards Waterford city.“Rural transport is a godsend,” he added. “It was a long old day making it to class and today made it worth it. But even if I didn’t have today it would still be worth it.“I liked every bit of it,” he added. “It was marvellous actually. You couldn’t be more happy with the setup in Waterford.”Mr Boyle was praised by WIT president Willie Donnelly for his achievement: “He’s a real inspiration to us all because he’s decided that education is still for him.”It was in 2016 when he first came to notice, after a video of his classmates singing happy birthday to him as he turned 79 went viral.He had over half a century more life experience than many of his classmates but he found it made little difference: “They treated me as one of them. The craic was mighty.“Going on the young people that were there in WIT, this country will be in good hands,” he said.He thanked WIT for accommodating him, “They were very helpful getting you down on the right path. They were marvellous and fair play.”For anyone his vintage who may be considering third level education, he said the trick is to “plan well”.“Let’s be honest about it - there is a lot of reading and writing. But it can be done. My message to anyone is if I can do it, they can.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Patrick Fennell pleaded guilty to four robberies in DublinCampaigner states in a video he intends to \u0026lsquoget a posse together\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquostart arresting\u0026rsquo people, court toldCorbyn plan to broker new accord with EU in 2020 dismissed by MinisterFormer president, whose husband is chancellor of DCU, succeeds Mary Robinson in TCD roleTen children receive medals at Share A Dream foundation fun event in LimerickMan (65) who had procedure to remove gallstones died unexpectedly, court hearsMove will see growth in export of beef to Ireland\u0026rsquos fifth biggest market for agri-foodDispute centres on restoration of pay for staffChild came in contact with man after mother answered advert purported to be from talent agency looking for children for filmsWoman got negative result in 2013 but was later diagnosed with cancer, court hearsSome 156 rural locations awarded on Thursday by Minister Michael RingIrish Water, council criticised for failure to install shutdown at Leixlip treatment plantMan in balaclava pictured reading letter threatening to kill directors of Border firm\u0026lsquoMy message to anyone is if I can do it, they can\u0026rsquo, says man who returned to college in his 70sTwo people a day became homeless last month on averageLeo Varadkar says part of what politicians do \u0026lsquois advertising, that is how you get in touch with people\u0026rsquoINMO records 11,452 patients on trolleys across the State this monthInquest hears nurse (58) suffered fractured skull when caravan toppled 30 feetStaff member held equally liable as she did not use footstool provided when lifting boxes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4068258.1572549060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"quinn industrial holdings director questions why garda%C3%AD have not removed sign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThis sign  remains standing on the outskirts of Ballyconnell, Co Cavan a few hundred feet from the border with Co Fermanagh.  Photograph: Lorraine TeevanA director of Quinn Industrial Holdings has questioned why it has taken gardaí so long to remove a sign erected in Co Cavan which makes claims about salaries of the company’s directors.The garda commissioner, Drew Harris, said this week that any such signs would be removed by gardaí, but QIH director John McCartin on Thursday asked why it had taken so long. “If the gardaí are going to take it down, why isn’t it down? Why didn’t they take it down in the beginning and forensically examine it? It would have surely incriminated those behind the campaign of intimidation,” he said. The central issue was not the sign itself but the question of control in Border areas, Mr McCartin continued.“It’s not about the posters or what’s written on it, it’s saying, ‘We’re in control’.”It is understood that while some signs were removed following the receipt of enforcement notices from county councils, an enforcement notice in regard to the remaining sign was not complied with.In correspondence with QIH, Cavan County Council indicated that it had concerns for its staff around the removal of the sign, and that it had been “advised by persons unknown” not to remove it.The local authority cathaoirleach, Fianna Fáil councillor Shane P O’Reilly, said the council “takes the responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of its staff very seriously and we will continue to monitor the situation”.On Monday a threat was issued against “anyone who removes signs, whether that be council employees or outside contractors” warning that they “will be targeted.”The same statement threatened five directors of QIH with a “permanent solution” unless they resigned their positions in the company. Those named included Kevin Lunney, who was abducted outside his Co Fermanagh home in September and beaten and tortured before being dumped on a road in Co Cavan.QIH was the name given to the firm after local businessman Sean Quinn lost the firm following multi-billion losses on his investment in Anglo Irish Bank. Large placardThe large placard, which has been on display outside a tile company in Ballyconnell, Co Cavan for more than a year, makes claims about the salaries of three company directors and compares them to the alleged income of former Quinn group founder, Sean Quinn. “Liam McCaffrey’s salary, £487,000 plus expences (sic),” it reads. “Tony \u0026amp Kevin Lunney’s Salery (sic), £345,000 plus expences (sic). SEAN QUINN ZERO £POUNDS.” Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the garda commissioner told reporters that the issue would be dealt with. He said the posters would be removed “and if we have to employ specialist help to do that we will do so”. Asked why it had taken so long, Mr Harris replied: “This matter has been brought to my attention and it will be dealt with.”Signs naming directors of the company had previously appeared on lampposts in the border region, including an image of Kevin Lunney accompanied by the word “traitor”. These were removed and have not reappeared in recent months. It is understood that signs have in the past been removed by local gardaí on at least one occasion. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) have previously removed signs erected on the northern side of the Border. “This isn’t about the poster. This is about somebody robustly calling out the institutions of the State and saying, ‘We’re in charge’,” said Mr McCartin. “Criminal gangs are giving orders to the institutions of the State, and why wouldn’t they, they’ve managed to intimidate the State,” he said.Mr Quinn and his family have repeatedly condemned acts of vandalism and violence against their former businesses and properties and the executives who worked in the family enterprise over the years. They have disavowed the campaign of violence and distanced themselves from any acts purported to be carried out in their names."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters – published by the trade press – telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. “I had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,” Kaye wrote in , three years after the release. “One was ‘Humpty Dumpty’. Another was ‘Ralph Coates’, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.” The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since.220 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Michael BayThe first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there’s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. When I look back at it, that was crap,” he said of the film in 2011. “The writers\u0027 strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you\u0027ve got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It\u0027s a BS way to make a movie.”While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. “Our shoot time in Norway was way too short,” he explained following the film’s release. “We didn’t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.” Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. “It’s like when you’re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don’t see the whole picture,” he added.420 Avengers: Age of Ultron – Joss WhedonJoss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (£1.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn’t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: “I’m tied and I had a terrible time.” A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. “I was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.” Whedon added that he remains “proud” of the film, yet there are still things about the film that “frustrate” him hugely. Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer’s one to Jesse Carter. “It was just too ambitious,” he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. “We didn\u0027t have enough time, we didn\u0027t finish it, it didn\u0027t look good, it was just a whole ... mess. We couldn\u0027t get it done, and I had a falling out with the producer. He abandoned it, and I had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. Then later, it was put out on DVD without my approval.”Before Babylon AD – a futuristic sci-fi flick about a mercenary who has to escort a woman from Russia to America – reached cinemas in the UK, the director, Mathieu Kassovitz, was trying to distance himself from the Vin Diesel-led project. The movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet,” he said. “All the action scenes had a goal: they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters... instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24. Kassovitz later added the film was pure violence and stupidity.In 1992, Dennis Hopper joined the ranks of directors who released their film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee (famously used when filmmakers disown their own film). Originally called Catchfire, the Jodie Foster-starring thriller about a woman who enters witness protection was later retitled Backtrack, and 20 minutes were cut for the straight-to-VHS release. Hopper rarely spoke about the film he wanted to distance himself as much as possible from the doomed project.“I think it’s a beautiful film to look at and I think the score is beautiful,” Steven Soderberg said of The Underneath, “but 15 seconds in I know we’re in trouble because of how f***ing long it takes to get through those opening credits. That’s just an indication of what’s wrong with this thing: it’s just totally sleepy.” The film, about a recovering gambling addict, was an unsurprising box-office flop. “I can’t say I’d recommend it to anyone,” Soderbergh added, “other than to look at in the context of someone’s career”.Alan Taylor – of Game of Thrones and Sopranos fame – seemed a perfect fit for Thor, the heroic God of Thunder who spoke in Shakespearean prose. When the sequel was released, many were disappointed with the film, which somehow wasted Christopher Eccleston, who played the villain. Taylor later criticised the project, saying: “The Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don’t wish upon anybody else.”1120 Fear and Desire – Stanley KubrickFew filmmakers have spotless filmographies. Stanley Kubrick believed the blotch on his was Fear and Desire – the renowned-perfectionist’s cinematic debut. As his stature as a director grew, Kubrick was said to grow ever-more disgruntled with Fear and Desire, an anti-war film about four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Reports emerged in the Sixties that Kubrick had destroyed the original negative print, and was hoping to destroy all leftover prints. In 1964, Kubrick called the film “a serious effort, ineptly done”.1220 Batman and Robin – Joel SchumacherAlmost everyone involved with Batman \u0026amp Robin seems to hate the final product. George Clooney has apologised for his Bat-nippled version of the Caped Crusader, while director Joel Schumacher has said sorry multiple times. “Look, I apologise,” he said in 2017. “I want to apologise to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that.” After the widely maligned film reached cinemas, Schumacher said he was treated like “scum”. “It was like I had murdered a baby,” he continued.1320 The Day the Clown Cried – Jerry LewisJerry Lewis’s The Day the Clown Cried has never been released. The director, who also starred as the leading character, locked the film – about a clown arrested in Nazi Germany for drunkenly defaming Hitler – in a private vault after completion. Lewis thought the film was so “bad, bad, bad” that he often refused to discuss the project, only commenting very occasionally. I was ashamed of the work and I was grateful I had the power to contain it all and never let anyone see it. It could have been wonderful but I slipped up – I didn\u0027t quite get it,” he said in 2013.Everything was looking good for Fantastic Four before filming began. Some of Hollywood’s most promising actors were playing the eponymous characters – Michael B Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell – while Josh Trank, coming off the back of runaway success Chronicle, was hired to direct. During post-production, though, everything fell apart. Trank was forced by the studio, Fox, to do extensive reshoots (you can tell which scenes were reshot because Mara’s wig looks awful and Teller has varying lengths of stubble). The month before the film’s release, the director spoke out on Twitter. “A year ago I had a fantastic version of this,” he wrote. “And it would’ve received great reviews. You’ll probably never see it. That’s reality though.” The film bombed at the box office, with Trank’s tweet reportedly costing Fox between $5m and $10m (£3.8m and £7.6m).During the Nineties, Kiefer Sutherland wanted to progress from acting to directing. Although his feature-film debut as director, 1997’s Truth or Consequences, was not exactly a critical success, he persevered, directing the 2000 flick Woman Wanted. Sutherland was so disappointed with the results, he released the film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee – becoming the last person to ever use the famed name. He has not directed a film since.A film about the pseudonym Alan Smithee that ironically ended up being an Alan Smithee film. Arthur Hiller had no intention of disowning Burn Hollywood Burn, which aimed to lampoon the Hollywood system. The film centred on a director, named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle), who hands in a cut of a film, only for the studio to recut the entire thing. Life mirrored art as the studio behind Burn Hollywood Burn took the film away from Hiller, who ended up using the Smithee pseudonym on the release. Following the success of Oscar Best Picture winner The Elephant Man, David Lynch could have done almost anything. Despite having not read the book, Lynch agreed to adapt Dune, choosing the project over the third Star Wars, Return of the Jedi. Lynch soon started work on turning Frank Herbert’s epic novel into a screenplay, turning in over five drafts. Yet, despite the preparation time, the final results were less than satisfactory for the director. “I started selling out on Dune,” he said. “Looking back, it\u0027s no one\u0027s fault but my own. I probably shouldn\u0027t have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in.”David Fincher was just 28 years old when the producers of Alien decided to bring the upstart on board their second sequel. With just five weeks’ preparation time, an unfinished script, and no real clout behind his name, Fincher struggled with the film. “Oh, it was just awful,” he later said. “This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” In 2009, promoting The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher elaborated: “I had to work on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated it more than me to this day, no one hates it more than me.”The fourth film in the horror series Hellraiser had a troubled production. Original director Kevin Yagher was ordered by the studio to reshoot scenes, which he refused to do. Joe Chappelle stepped in, leading to Yagher demanding the Alan Smithee pseudonym be used. The final film – which acted as both a prequel and a sequel to the other three films – was not screened for critics, and was dismissed by many fans.David O Russell began working on Nailed in 2008. Envisioning the film as a romantic comedy with political undertones, the director cast Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in leading roles, and was awarded $26 million (£20 million) to make it. And still, somehow, the entire filming process was a mess. The set was shutdown a reported 14 times after cast and crew complained about not being paid. Eventually, after key scenes were not filmed during production, the entire thing was abandoned. After Russell started drawing Oscars attention for The Fighter and American Hustle, though, the studio wanted to get Nailed out in cinemas. Work continued on the film without Russell’s involvement. The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director’s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye. Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters – published by the trade press – telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. “I had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,” Kaye wrote in , three years after the release. “One was ‘Humpty Dumpty’. Another was ‘Ralph Coates’, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.” The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since.220 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Michael BayThe first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there’s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. When I look back at it, that was crap,” he said of the film in 2011. “The writers\u0027 strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you\u0027ve got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It\u0027s a BS way to make a movie.”While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. “Our shoot time in Norway was way too short,” he explained following the film’s release. “We didn’t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.” Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. “It’s like when you’re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don’t see the whole picture,” he added.420 Avengers: Age of Ultron – Joss WhedonJoss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (£1.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn’t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: “I’m tied and I had a terrible time.” A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. “I was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.” Whedon added that he remains “proud” of the film, yet there are still things about the film that “frustrate” him hugely. Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer’s one to Jesse Carter. “It was just too ambitious,” he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. “We didn\u0027t have enough time, we didn\u0027t finish it, it didn\u0027t look good, it was just a whole ... mess.

This is actually a great result for us.” Two years later, the BBC reviewed Vine’s contract and Leatham reflected on what a “torturous” process it had been.Armitage told The Independent: The email says it all. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything to add, it was a negotiation 12 years ago.Vine no longer works exclusively for the BBC but he is one of the broadcaster’s best-paid presenters with a salary of more than £290,000 for his work on Radio 2.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some institutions were forced to pay compensation to students over lost hours.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn gestures as launches the party\u0027s election campaign in south London.

If they choose to ignore this message from their staff then strike action looks inevitable.”The union said it balloted more than 52,000 USS members in 69 universities for strike action and overall turnout was 53 per cent.A spokesperson for Universities UK, which represents university employers, said: “Employers remain open to further talks with UCU to discuss how the dispute can be resolved without industrial action, which would be damaging for staff and students.\u0026nbspRecent negotiations between UCU and Universities UK concluded with no cuts to USS pension benefits, and employers paying the majority of the extra contributions required under pensions law.“In a challenging economic environment, this outcome is the best that could be achieved.

The 10-minute trend is for the future and is essential for adoption of electric vehicles because it solves the range anxiety problem.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

Typical lithium-ion batteries would only last around 60 charges using the new method.The discovery comes just weeks after the inventors of the first lithium-ion battery were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.Elon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberThe combined work of John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino\u0026nbspled to the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery being produced in 1985. They are now used in everything from mobile phones to laptops, as well as the rapidly growing electric vehicle industry.The researchers now hope to improve this charge time to just five minutes.“We are working to charge an energy-dense electric vehicle battery in five minutes without damaging it,” Mr Wang said.“This will require highly stable electrolytes and active materials in addition to the self-heating structure we have invented.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.”The move follows a warning from the European Commission that there was “evidence of coordinated inauthentic behaviour aimed at spreading isive material on online platforms”, and that “malign actors constantly change their strategies”.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

Banning political ads on digital channels does feel like taking a step back to traditional media, so limiting the targeting of political ads seems like a better option for Facebook,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“The question Facebook is asking is how far should businesses like Facebook be able to censor opinions and news?”Mark Zuckerberg’s secret plan to crush TikTokOne of those calling for Facebook to be more open and transparent about the spread of disinformation across the social network is the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit organisation that promotes the sharing of free information.“Twitter’s decision is very welcome and sends a strong signal to other social media giants. It will go a considerable way to preventing the spread of disinformation and ‘fake news’,” said Catherine Stihler, chief executive of the Open Knowledge Foundation.However, she warned that more needs to be done to prevent disinformation campaigns from blighting the December’s election, forthcoming elections across Europe, and next year’s US Presidential election.“Facebook must act on the growing demands for greater transparency,” Ms Stihler added. “Social media giants must work to build a fair, free and open digital world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t know why. I think it’s because it’s always related to women.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“They never say feisty man, kid maybe, but I find it slightly insulting, I don’t know why. I want to find another word.”\u0026nbspScott and her co-host Matt Baker simply responded with a surprised “Oh”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through to see the best TV shows of 2019 (so far) “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 346 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 446 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 646 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 746 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 1046 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1546 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1846 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2146 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2346 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272646 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3746 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3846 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3946 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Arriving in the wake of Marvel’s Black Panther, the film highlights the links between the saga of the real-life Agoji women, who fought in the former Kingdom of Dahomey (located in modern-day Benin), and the all-women comic-book world protectors known as Dora Milaje.The writer Jack Thorne says his latest four-part drama, which explores the aftermath of a disaster on a small community, was shaped by the Grenfell Tower fire. Rather than overcrowded west London, his takes place in Glyngolau, a fictional run-down town in Wales. A new building project, The Light, is being built on the outskirts. It’s unclear what The Light is, exactly, which is deliberate. The point is not what it is, exactly, but what it represents: 1,000 new jobs and a rare moment of economic optimism for families who have forgotten what hope feels like.Watching Seven Worlds, One Planet, it’s hard to know what to worry about most: the future of wildlife – catastrophically imperilled by our fondness for fossil fuels, long-haul travel and convenience food – or Attenborough himself, now 93 and one of the few people that the world will listen to about the impending apocalypse. Like the species on whose behalf he speaks, his continued existence is vital for us all.Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast. She has a face – and a set of elastic expressions – that feels both well-suited to a period piece (as first displayed in her Oscar-nominated role in True Grit in 2010), and resolutely out of place in it. Just as Emily Dickinson was. Steinfeld crackles with charm and impropriety.Click through to see the best TV shows of 2019 (so far) “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 346 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

It opens up a new area of study,” he said.Created with Sketch.Space as seen from a grandmother\u0027s garden Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Captured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeBlack holes have such powerful gravitational pulls nothing – including light – can escape. They form when stars die, shrink and then explode. Neutron stars are small dense starts that form when stars die and collapse.\u0026nbspFor years astronomers only knew about black holes that were between five and 15 times the mass of the sun. If neutron stars were above 2.5 times the mass of the sun, scientists believe they would collapse into a black hole.\u0026nbspIn 2017 scientists used Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory\u0026nbspto spot two black holes merging together in a galaxy 1.8 billion light years away. One black hole was 31 times the mass of the sun and the other was 25 times its mass.\u0026nbspAlexei Leonov: Cosmonaut who made the first space walkVirgin Galactic reveals Under Armour suits for space touristsThis showed that black holes could have larger masses than ever recorded before.Researchers suspected this meant black holes could also be discovered that\u0026nbspwere somewhere between the size of the biggest neutron star\u0026nbspand smallest black hole.\u0026nbspAstronomers\u0026nbsplooked through data collected from\u0026nbspthe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment,\u0026nbspwhich collected light spectra from around 100,000 stars in the Milky Way and discovered a low-mass black hole\u0026nbspthat was 3.3 times the mass of the sun, according to the paper published in Science.\u0026nbspProfessor Thompson said: “What we’ve done here is come up with a new way to search for black holes, but we’ve also potentially identified one of the first of a new class of low-mass black holes that astronomers hadn’t previously known about.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The drawn-out cries of “Orderrrrr” during fractious but historic late-night votes, the\u0026nbspdramatic pauses before announcements that would shape the course of Britain’s EU withdrawal, the long-winded but momentous rulings that\u0026nbspdashed the hopes of successive\u0026nbspprime ministers.John Bercow will step down as House of Commons speaker on Thursday having outlasted three prime ministers and presided over 10\u0026nbspof the most seismic years in British political history.While some MPs\u0026nbspare already lamenting his retirement, others are delighted to see the back of one of the most isive speakers in modern history.In fact, to say that Bercow was controversial would be to\u0026nbspunderstate the animosity he\u0026nbspinspired in some.Despite having served as Tory MP for Buckingham for 12 years before being elected as speaker in 2009, his habit of siding with parliament against the government meant he quickly became more popular with other parties than with his own.He is despised by many\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbspfor his long-winded and often\u0026nbspself-aggrandising monologues, his abrupt rebuttals\u0026nbspand at times petty way of dealing with dissenters and, most of all, for his eyebrow-raising rulings.To his critics, he is an ardent Remainer who has indefensibly abused his position and repeatedly ripped up the rulebook in a bid to frustrate Brexit.To his allies, though, he is a reformer who has repeatedly defended the rights of the House of Commons in the ongoing power struggle with the executive.What both sides agree on is that Bercow’s rulings in recent years have had an immeasurable impact on the course of Britain’s political future and the workings of parliament for years to come.A series of major decisions, all of them contentious, guarantee that he will be a major figure in the history books when the Brexit saga is written up for posterity.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Theresa May holding a third “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal\u0026nbsp– a decision that forced her to affectively abandon the agreement she had spent months negotiating, and rapidly hastened her demise.\u0026nbspBercow made a similar ruling against Boris Johnson\u0026nbspearlier this month, forcing the prime minister to change tack and first try to introduce legislation turning his Brexit deal into law, and then seek a general election.In between, he took the highly unusual step on several occasions of allowing backbenchers to seize control of the Commons timetable\u0026nbspto pass laws blocking a no-deal Brexit –\u0026nbsprulings so monumental that, without them, it is possible the UK would have crashed out of the EU by now.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say

in LondonEach time, his decision provoked uproar from Conservative MPs. Each time, Bercow brazenly dismissed it.It’s fair to say that self-confidence is not an area where Bercow is lacking, but he also\u0026nbspsaw himself as a reformer, so the objections of traditional Tories mattered little to him.He announced as much in justifying one of his most controversial decisions:\u0026nbspallowing backbenchers to amend a business motion (a Commons timetable) in January 2019 to force ministers to publish their Brexit strategy much earlier than they had wanted to.Amid a furious backlash from Eurosceptics, the speaker told the Commons: “If we were guided only by\u0026nbspprecedent, nothing in our procedures would ever change. Things do change.”BercowBercow has been credited with helping to modernise parliament, including relaxing House of Commons dress codes and allowing pregnant and unwell MPs to vote by proxy for the first time. He also helped oversee the introduction of a new grievance procedure for allegations of harassment and bullying.This carried with it a certain irony, given that the speaker himself has been dogged by a number of allegations of bullying – all of them denied – in recent years.Several Commons clerks have come forward to allege\u0026nbspthat he verbally harassed them on a number of occasions, in some cases so severely that one employee was reportedly left with post-traumatic stress disorder.He was also criticised after appearing to refer to Andrea Leadsom, then the leader of the Commons, with whom he had a fractious relationship, as a “stupid woman”.For all his insistence that complaints be properly investigated, there was no formal inquiry into Bercow’s conduct, after the Commons standards committee blocked a probe.He will leave parliament without having been forced to answer questions about his conduct towards his juniors.Bercow addresses house after angry exchanges about Brexit and the PM’s languageMany people outside Westminster will know none of this. In the UK and beyond, John Bercow will be best remembered not for his constitutional rulings but for his bizarre style of chairing proceedings.His manner of speaking, reportedly based on his impressions of Jane Austen characters,\u0026nbspsparked news stories around the world and made him an unlikely celebrity in various nations.His particular favourites included turning Tory MP Peter Bone’s surname into a five-second foghorn and calling Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire’s name​ to the tune of Bon Jovi’s “Livin’\u0026nbspon a Prayer”.His put-downs also became legendary in Westminster, with barked orders for\u0026nbspMPs to stop\u0026nbspchuntering from a sedentary position and suggestions that they instead take up yoga among his favoured barbs.None of this will be remembered for long, of course, and Bercow’s enduring legacy is on Brexit. Depending on what happens in the forthcoming election, he may be viewed in time as the man who empowered parliament to avert a catastrophic no-deal exit from the EU.Or, just maybe, he will be lauded by some, and hated by others, as one of the reasons for an outcome that his more conspiracy-minded critics claim was his ambition all along – stopping Brexit entirely.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal. He has a deal.It’s Jo Swinson, her SNP cronies and the Labour Party who want to scupper that deal. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you run away or say anything about what happened to you, then they’re going to deport you back to your country, Laura Durán, of the charity Every Child Protected Against TraffickingUK, tells Sun Online.With nail salons now a staple on Britains high streets, offering plenty of low-skilled labour roles, its perhaps unsurprising that many Vietnamese people see them as a ticket to a better le.But this makes them easy prey for vile trafficking networks, who are thought to illegally smuggle around , Vietnamese citizens including children, to Europe each year.They lure their desperate victims with  promises of lucrative jobs in cash-only nail bars and cannabis farms, assuring them they can change their own and their familys fortunes.The sick trade has become so prevalent that over the past decade a holding camp in Northern France has been dubbed Vietnam City, based on the huge number of Vietnamese migrants waiting to reach Britain.My family back paid someone and they got me this far, a Vietnamese man at another refugee camp, located slightly further north, told The Sun on Sunday.“People in England will get me a job when I get there. It’s scary when you think what happened [in Essex] but that’s the chance you take and I am ready to risk my le.Pham Thi Tra My, , texted her mum, Im dying because I cant breatheFor migrants with enough le savings, they can buy a VIP trip to the UK - which costs nearly £, and involves a flight on someone s passport, or a doctored diplomatic one, to Europe.Or the cheaper option - so-called grass packages costing up to £, - involves a less direct route to Europe that can take several months and hundreds of miles on foot and by road.Often, migrants first travel to China or Russia before moving West entered Russia as tourists, with many then travelling to Western Europe.Other popular connecting countries including France, Germany and Poland.They go through jungles, forests and theyre kept in wooden huts, immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal tells Sun Online, describing a migrants typical, dangerous journey to Britain.The gangs are ruthless. If someone is slowing down the group the smugglers will kill them.While Vietnam as a whole has seen a reduction in poverty, not all regions have been affected equally - so the majority of migrants come from a select few poor provinces.In Nghe An and Ha Tinh - where many lorry victims are feared to be from - the countryside is dotted with billboards for labour export firms advertising jobs or study overseas.Almost everyone round here has a relative overseas, local Bui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is suspected to be among those found dead last week, told Reuters.Young people must find ways to work abroad because its dficult to work at home.For those who survive the horror passage to Britain, their nightmares far from over.While plenty of the countrys nail salons and grooming parlours are reputable businesses, police say the industry has become a hotbed of labour exploitation.Labour exploitation in nail bars is one of the most prevalent areas of modern day slavery in the UK, Hardeep Walker, of the National Crime Agency , told our Stamp Out Slavery campaign this year.He added: The salon conditions are usually quite small and cramped and can have a strong smell of chemicals. The exploiter will be present in the salon, often acting as a front of house member of staff who meets and greets customers and takes payment whilst keeping a watchful eye over the workers.Even when their sht is finally over, the workers have no escape - because they tend to sleep in rooms above or attached to salons, and have no money of their own to spend.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.Our Stamp Out Slavery campaign, in conjunction with Co-op, has highlighted the plight of some of Britains slaves working in car washes and nail salons, farms and factories all over the UK.We called on the government to extend support for Britains slaves beyond the current -day limit and backing Lord McColls private members Bill demanding support be extended to a year.In April this year, a high court judge suspended the paltry time limit and said it should be subject to a full judicial review.In , two Bath nail bar owners were locked up for five and four years respectively in a landmark case, after forcing young Vietnamese women to work for no pay in UK salons.Thu Huong Nguyen and Viet Hoany Nguyen trafficked the girls between salons according to demand and exploited them in plain sight, the Crown Prosecution Servicesaid.But while they didnt pay one victim - with a second earning just £ a month - a search of Thu Huong Nguyens home uncovered £, in £ notes hidden inside a teddy bear.The same year,  nail salons were raided by police across London, Cardf and Edinburgh, resulting in  arrests, in a bid to tackle the epidemic.It came six years after the extradition of gangster Do Huan Nguyen, who smuggled more than  Vietnamese people to the UK to work in drug factories and nail salons.Last year, more than  potential victims of trafficking from Vietnam were identied, ECPAT tells Sun Online - although the real number is far higher because most go undocumented.Today, many victims continue to work in exploitative British nail salons, often avoiding eye contact and conversationas they apply coats of glossy polish.But these salons floor-to-ceiling windows and bright lights provide a colourful cover for a dark, sickening secret.What do employees look like What do they sound like How do you feel Souce: UnseenOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour. Butlow-paid workers were stopped from working  hours a week rather than the current average of , it would mean a substantial cut in pay for millions of people.That Theresa May was unable to win an outright majority against Jeremy Corbyn and his extreme economic policies in  is as astonishing in retrospect as it was at the time. What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

I think he has flipped the world of art over.Journalist Craig Williams had previously carried out an investigation into Banksy and concluded that Banksy was not just one person but a team of street artists with Del Naja, , as the ringleader.Del Naja has occasionally designed the artwork for Massive Attack’s albums, including ’s Heligoland which featured stencil art not dissimilar to Banksy’s style.Del Naja though as denied the rumour saying it was “greatly exaggerated”.Richard PfeferThe New York spraypainter Pfefer was spotted in front of a mural done by Banksy in March  and was accused of being the famous artist by the cops.Thierry GuettaThe French graffiti artist living in Los Angeles, who is also known as Mr Brainwash, is seen in Banksys documentary Exit Through the Gt Shop.The film tells the story of Guetta and his obsession with documenting his le on film.Some though think Guetta and Banksy are the same person.The notion it is Guetta springs from the idea that the hapless artist was only feigning mediocrity in the film and it was really Banksy hiding in plain sight.Graffiti artist in AustraliaYouTube user Mia S claimed she had caught Banksy in the act after believing she had filmed the artist in Melbourne, Australia.The footage shows a bespectacled man in jeans, a dark jacket, hoodie and a cap.She approaches the graffiti artist before he tells her to “f**k off” and flees the scene.Lazarides worked with Banksy during his formative years, and many of his photos have never been seen before.The -page book, Banksy Captured, will reveal images from more than a decade of creativity and subversion, and Lazarides will offer limited-edition prints of his work at affordable prices in a bid to open art to a broader economic audience.Lazarides hails from Banksys reputed home town of Bristol, and was commissioned to create the artists portrait in , starting their partnership.He worked as his agent, photographer, driver, and gallerist.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After two years of Parliamentary battles and a souring of politics, more than  MPs have decided not to stand again. Some - like longest-serving MP Ken Clarke and Sir Winston Churchillaposs grandson Nicholas Soames - are retiring after decades of service. But others have decided the venom and anger around Brexit are making them want to call it a day. Those include ex-Tory, ex-Change UK Lib Dem Heidi Allen - who says public le has been utterly dehumanising. And key Tory Remainers like Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan led an exodus of prominent female MPs complaining about abuse. Meanwhile Speaker John Bercow is finally bowing out after nearly a decade and , ORDERs in the grand chair in the House of Commons. Hereaposs the full list of MPs whoaposve announced they are standing down so far.  When people talk about “Tory Big Beasts”, the image they have in their head is -year-old Ken Clarke. The Rushclfe MP holds the title of ‘father of the house’ - which means he’s the longest serving MP, having been sworn in a few minutes earlier than Labour ’s Dennis Skinner. And he’s been a cabinet minister under three successive Tory Prime Ministers - Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, Home Secretary and Chancellor under John Major and Justice Secretary under David Cameron. In fact, he was one of only five ministers to serve throughout the whole of the  years of Tory governments led by Thatcher and Major. He’s socially and economically liberal, and has been president of the Tory Reform Group since . And he’s perhaps been the Conservative Party’s proudest and most prominent pro-European voices for several decades. He had the Tory whip removed weeks before finally standing down for voting to block a no-deal Brexit. John Bercow  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced in September that he would stand down. He developed a reputation for standing up for MPsapos rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons. But he later faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe. The ex-Tory MP succeeded the late Michael Martin as Speaker in . Amber Rudd  Ms Ruddaposs departure means the House of Commons will lose one of its most prominent anti-hard-Brexit MPs. She resigned as DWP Secretary in solidarity with  Tories who lost the whip in September. Yet she also had changed her position in the past, moving from vowing to block a no-deal Brexit to saying it would have to be left open as an option. Born in London in , she was the fourth child of stockbroker Tony Rudd and magistrate Ethne Fitzgerald. She went to Cheltenham Ladiesapos College and Queenaposs College in London before reading History at Edinburgh University. She married the writer A.A. Gill and the couple had two children together in the s but later orced. Gill, who died in , referred to Rudd as aposthe Silver Spoonapos in his reviews and she was an aristocracy advisor to Four Weddings And A Funeral. Ms Rudd was forced to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal after she misled MPs by denying removal targets existed. An internal inquiry later found she was not given full information herself. Her brother Roland Rudd runs the Peopleaposs Vote campaign - where he is embroiled in a furious row with his own staff over a botched bid to oust senior staff.  Boris Johnsonaposs younger brother suggested the PM was failing the national interest as he announced heaposd quit in September. The Orpington MP said he had been torn between family loyalty and the national interest but that it was time for othersto take on his role. The Universities and Science minister had previously quit the government when Theresa May as PM over her handling of Brexit. Remainer Jo Johnson added that it had been an honour to serve his constituents since . Sir Nicholas Soames  Sir Nicholas Soames is an important talisman in Conservative circles as the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - but lost the whip last month when he decided to block no-deal Brexit. The -year-old MP for Mid Sussex claimed a no-deal Brexit would be the most serious crisis Britain has faced since the Second World War. The a staunch pro-European who was a minister under John Major, also claimed Margaret Thatcher would not have taken the UK out of the EU. Confirming his decision he said: I will be voting against the government with a very heavy heart. But he was later spotted grinning during his final vote after  years - to trigger an election hours after having the whip restored by Boris Johnson.  The MP rose to prominence when he took on Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership following the EU referendum in . His ill-fated campaign failed to dislodge Corbyn, though he did finish with more than % of membersapos votes. The MP of nine years later worked in Jeremy Corbynaposs Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary while Stormont was collapsed. Heidi Allen  Lib Dem Heidi Allen will quit as an MP at the next General Election , blaming the nastiness of British politics. The former Tory MP and Change UK leader switched parties more than faced elections after she initially became dissatisfied with the Conservatives over welfare cuts. She said she was heartbroken by the decision, but had become exhausted from being shouted at in the street and sworn at on social media. In a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire, she wrote: I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace. Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home. Vince Cable  The former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has been one of the partyaposs most controversial figures. A key figure in the Coalition, where he was Business Secretary, lost his Twickenham seat in  - before ing to Parliament in  and taking on the job of leading his part. A one-time Labour Party member and ex-economics lecturer, Sir Vince appeared on the Christmas edition of BBC Oneaposs Strictly Come Dancing in . Sir Vince, , was replaced by East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson and warned there would be battles about Brexit to come When he became leader in , he was the oldest person to be appointed head of a major party since Winston Churchill. A grandfather, he is married and has three children.  Full list of MPs standing down Speaker John Bercow : “It is with a heavy heart that I step down as MP for this great constituency”. Tories    Nicky Morgan : The abuse for doing the job of a modern MP can only be justied , ultimately, parliament does what it is supposed to do - represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by the electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest.

Peter Heaton-Jones : “This is a purely personal decision. It is based on several factors, including a signicant change in my family circumstances since my re-election in .

Funding for nurseries providing  free hours a week of free childcare will rise from £. per child to £. in April  - under %. In a statement slipped out just before the Commons broke up, Schools minister Nick Gibb said it would mean spending £.bn to support nurseries and childminders in England.He said it would deliver high quality care and education and came on top of funds from Chancellor Sajid Javid at the Spending Round in September.But nurseries that have long complained about the low rates branded the rise a drop in the ocean. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, branded the rise negligible and a few pennies.    He added: “These providers are facing huge increases in business costs every year: rises in the national living and minimum wages, mortgages and rents, business rates, utilities costs. “Worst still is the news that those areas that have seen funding fall over recent years will now see their rates frozen rather than increase. For providers in these areas already fighting for survival, this could well be the final straw. It is a key Tory policy to give working parents in England  hours a week of free childcare for kids aged three and four - with an offer for some aged two.Each parent must work at least  hours a week to qualy. Labour has vowed to extend the offer to all two, three and four-year-olds with no means testing at all.The level of funding for the scheme has led to claims it was being starved of cash by the government. Last year the Commons Treasury Committee warned the shortfall in funds was hitting the quality of service and meant poorer parents risk losing out in favour of richer ones. Some providers hiked charges for children who were not eligible for the scheme, such as under-threes, MPs said. Meanwhile parents were being asked to pay for things that were previously free, such as food and activities.

Tom and Victoria Browne, from St Austell in Cornwall, opted for the feast, saying we just donapost do anything traditionally. Victoria, , called up Dominoaposs to find out what they could get for their budget, and the answer was quite a lot, Cornwall Live reports . The mum-of-three said: “Most people know me and Tom just don’t do anything originally. I didn’t want traditional sandwiches or anything at the wedding, I wanted something that stood out.  “We actually kept joking saying ‘shall we have Dominoaposs ’ but as it got closer and we didn’t have any food plans we started seriously considering it and I emailed Dominoaposs asking the question.” To her delight, the restaurant replied saying that it could cater their wedding, but that catering a wedding would be a first for the local branch. “I was so paranoid about whether they were actually going to be able to do it that I went in the day before and said ‘are you are all aware of my order for tomorrow ’” she said. On the big day itself, Victoria and her -year-old husband said that staff came “strolling in and shocked everybody.” They said the food was delivered piping hot as staff laid out the whopping  large pizza boxes,  garlic breads,  boxes of chicken strips and  boxes of wedges accompanied with copious amounts of the obligatory garlic and herb dip.  She said: “They were pretty good. It all came in piping hot and the staff were quite happy to stand and have a photo with me. People are still gob smacked with it, people think that as a buffet you have to have like sandwiches and stuff and I don’t really like pasties and I’m not picking them because everyone  likes them.” The couple said that when they first told people about their plans, that guests were a little sceptical. Victoria said that friends and family were certain in the run up to the wedding that she was just winding them up. She says that even her hairdresser on the day was still questioning whether they were actually going to be offering pizza in place of a traditional wedding breakfast. But the couple said that all doubt was quickly withdrawn when the smell of fresh pizza and garlic bread filled their wedding venue.

A sofa is a big investment and you buy it for it to look nice and enjoy it, not hide it away, which is what we want to do.” The couple complained to Harveys, which advised them to get a report from a technician and go from there. Harveys has said it can take no further action on the dispute, but the couple is hoping the sofa can be removed and the money refunded. David, , said: “We went through all the correct channels and contacted a technician from a company recommended by Harveys. “The original report noted sunlight damage as the cause but the sofa is a good bit away from the window and parts of the couch that aren’t even in sunlight have turned green too. “We challenged it and were then told it was due to the chemicals used on the sofa. But the only ones used were those provided by Harveys at the time of purchase. Harveys then told us there was nothing they could do, despite us having a protection plan. It doesn’t cover it and so we were basically advised to contact trading standards. We are so disappointed. I feel like we have just been fobbed off.

Naliah Noreen, , and her two brothers ran five drug hotlines which made or fielded , calls over a four month period and had up to , customers. The mum-of-one forced a -year-old boy into becoming a runner after telling him he owed the gang money. The terried boy was told dealing drugs would pay off his debts and Noreen and her relatives would drive the teenager around local housing estates near his home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester so he could make door-to-door deliveries of heroin.    Noreen - known amongst addicts as the woman with the really arrogant bad attitude - also travelled to Lancashire and Staffordshire, to collect large hauls of dirty money on behalf of her boyfriend. Police arrested her in August last year during a series of raids after after learnt of the unnamed ladaposs ordeal. During interview she told officers: Better get me the f**k out of here or Iaposm going to kick off. The boy who cannot be named is now receiving help from specialist police officers. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Noreen, from Rochdale, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin plus a separate charge of money laundering. Her brothers Asad Ali,  and Ratib Ali, , and their housemate Janaid Rehman,  were jailed at earlier hearings. Her boyfriend Mohammed Abu Khan, , is currently serving seven-and-a-half years in jail. The court heard Noreen came to the attention of police in November  after she was assigned by Khan to meet the gangaposs distributors in Nelson and Stoke to pick up drugs money. Officers kept her under surveillance and during a rendezvous in Audley in February  was seen collecting a Tesco carrier bag containing £, from a dealer in a VW Golf. She was subsequently stopped on the M Northbound near junction  and arrested but she was freed under investigation after she told police she had been asked by Khan to collect money which she thought was the repayment of a loan.  In the meantime she and three other members of her family became involved in running five drug hotlines Rocky, Tyson, Woody, Kez, and Doctor. Daniel Calder prosecuting said: These were used to organise and facilitate the street-dealing of large quantities of Cocaine and Heroin. Ms Noreenaposs role appears to have primarily been to direct the supply of the drugs. A user would call or message one of the drugs lines to place an order, the person with the handset for that drug line would then call one of the dealers to pass on the order and they would then in turn contact Nailah Noreen to arrange for the drugs to be delivered to the user. Whilst Ms. Noreenaposs role was primarily organising the delivery of drugs, it is clear she also was involved in delivering them to users, as can be seen from text messages recovered from her mobile telephone. One describes how following the arrest of the person running the Kez line, Ms. Noreen is described as late aposs, slim build, with a really arrogant bad attitude. Police also became aware that a -year-old boy was being used to deliver Class A drugs.  It is plain, the group, including this defendant, were responsible for controlling the activities of the boy who delivered both cocaine and heroin to users who had contacted the drug lines being operated by Ms Noreen and her family. Police dismantled the drug hotlines after arresting two men in a stolen VW Golf fitted with  registration plates and recovered twenty wraps of heroin and  wraps of cocaine plus mobile telephone handsets containing the SIMs for the Tyson and Rocky drug lines. Noreen was re-arrested in August . Mr Calder added: When she was later interviewed she began by telling the officers they better get me the f..k out of here or Iaposm going to kick off. She then proceeded to call them pr**ks throughout the interview. In short she denied the offences, and asserted that she was a drug user not a drug dealer.  When asked about messages in which she asked her brother Asas for the number for the graft line, she said she was entitled to ask her brother for a drug number, and intended to order drugs for herself. Noreen had a previous conviction for drug driving. Her lawyer Gemma Maxwell said in mitigation: Her conduct was born out of personal circumstances and she was very much under direction of her boyfriend at the time. He is far more criminal astute than her and whilst we donapost say sheaposs been exploited there is certainly a degree of pressure placed on her. She instructs me quite passionately that she did not directly recruit that child. Sheaposs got a child of her own and looks back at what happened with disgust. She is a now a complete contrast to the person she was upon arrest.

I knew I was too old to be afraid of the dark, but I hated climbing the stairs of my childhood home in Harrogate, North Yorks. Why  Because I often felt the presence of a ghost. It was just there, watching, and it made my whole body tingle with fear. But I didn’t just sense it – I could see it too. I remember being seven years old and walking out of my bedroom into the hall. A dark cloud breezed past the doorway and down the stairs, before vanishing. “Hello,” I shouted down the dark stairwell. My voice echoed into the empty space, I was alone on the top-floor landing. However, I wasn’t alone in the Edwardian terraced house. I didn’t mention it to my parents or my three older sisters. In fact, we never talked about the spooky goings-on.    My parents were more concerned about making their BB a success – and a ghost wasn’t good for business. However, our resident ghoul certainly scared a few of our guests. One man came down to breakfast ashen-faced. “I woke up in the middle of the night and felt someone sitting on the bed,” he ­stuttered. “When I turned on the light there was an indent in the covers. Do you have a ghost ” Mum and Dad tried to laugh it off. I was brought up Catholic and went to church every week, so talking about the dead didn’t feel right. But my religious upbringing didn’t stop me from having these eerie experiences. I remember lying in bed one night on the top floor when I felt the ghost a few feet away. I pulled the covers over my head and whispered the Lord’s Prayer.    I sensed the presence leave, but then I heard an almighty crash in the bathroom across the hall. I was too scared to investigate but in the morning I found my father’s heavy glass ashtray on the floor, unbroken. Had the ghost thrown the ashtray  I don’t know, but my young mind thought it had. While I like to think the ghost didn’t wish me harm, one incident suggests otherwise. I was in the shower room with my sister Susan when suddenly she screamed.

Mysterious things have happened at this spot - monks danced in fields, young women were tied to trees and an eerie fog seeped into gardens.And even todayyou listen carefully, you may hear the faint blows of a ghostly axe whistle from a brook across a secluded field near Coggeshall - more than  years after the woodcutteraposs death. Venture further into sleepy Coggeshall - one of the most historic and haunted towns in the UK - this Halloween and youaposll reach White Hart Hotel , spooked by at least one ghost.It wanders the old parts of the building and has been said to haunt the bedrooms. But regularsto stay in this higgledy-piggledy hotel purely for its haunted history. Have you seen a ghost or stayed at a haunted hotel  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  Rain battered the old th Century coaching inn aswas given exclusive access to brave the spectres. Scenes from The Shining flashed across our minds as a ghoulish figure seemed to float down a narrow hallway. Indeed, legend has it ghosts of two children thought to have died in a fire here roam the eerie corridors and rooms. We have a lady who wonapost stay in room two. She said she felt someone touch her in the night or felt something happen in the night. She wonapost stay there now. She still stays with us, she stays every week but she wonapost stay in room two. There have been quite a few incidents told to us by ious residents, about two specic rooms room two and room ,landlord Grant Beechey, , exclusively told .  Temperatures suddenly seemed to plummet in room , a tapping unsettled us and a creaking groaned during our stay. Downstairs, the hotel bar and restaurant bustled with regulars, some of whom had ed to brave the ghosts. Mr Beechey, a dad originally from Tooting, south London, added: These guests come back regularly, come back regularly to stay in that room. Whatever it is that is there brings them back time and time again. Room , which is the one most people come back to, is in the oldest part of the building.  We have people who come and stay in room  and the story Iaposve heard from people most often is about a poltergeist, a moving scenario where things appear, donapost appear, get moved and that type of thing. There was some evidence of spirits or other-worldly beings during our stay. A light flickered in room . The cameraaposs exposure skewed. Demons meddled in the system and the camera which had just shot scenes of full detail, fine colour and shadow had maled suddenly. Ghosts, it is said, can cause magnetism and haywire.  As dark clouds continued to gather, regulars told us theyaposd experienced a feeling of being watched, objects moving and other creepy phenomena here. Mr Beecheyaposs staff told him theyaposve been spooked. The manager said: I had a report from one of our chefs who was here on a short-term basis that heaposd felt he wasnapost alone in the kitchen when he was certainly alone.  He wasnapost disturbed by it but he had that feeling he wasnapost alone, and there was something going on. He just said he thought there was someone there with him. Certainly some of the corridors in the older part of the hotel have a look and feel about them. The building, now a Greene King establishment, mixes traditional and modern decor. Corridors, appearing to slant and tilt, guide visitors - welcome and unwelcome - to the  bedrooms.  Itaposs perhaps of little surprise to find the spooky little hotel in such an eerie little town. Coggeshall, on an ancient Roman road, is full of curious buildings associated with quirky tales. Monks held meetings in a secret room and danced in gardens, according to legend. And a coven allegedly used to meet at Marks Hall and take part in bizarre rituals, involving young women tied to trees. The ghost of a th century woodcutter called Robin roams the town, some say. Robin is said to have carved an image called the Angel of the Christmas Mysteries - but the statue was allegedly hidden and has never been found. Yet some believe blows of Robinaposs axe can still be heard near a brook which trickles through Coggeshall.

Following a succession of visits to the GP, Katie’s discomfort was dismissed as acute period pains and she was advised to ‘learn to live with it’. Katie, a service advisor, said: I felt stupid that this apparent aposnormal period painapos made me so unwell and I couldnapost understand why other girls around me could cope so well with the pain. It was really confusing at such a young age and scary that I could be facing this pain every month for my whole le.’ But when Katie met her now husband Liam when she was  everything began to change.    Starting a family was important to the couple and Katie stopped her contraceptive injection - which she used to dull her monthly pains - in  shortly after the pair married. In November , Katie fell pregnant and a scan at four weeks revealed she didnapost have a misshaped uterus as suggested previously, she in fact has a condition called uterus didelphys. Uterus didelphys is a disorder that develops before birth in which a woman has two uteruses instead of one - a patient can also have two cervixes and in some cases two vaginas. A year earlier the mum-to-be was given the diagnosis of a misshapen uterus when she was sent for an exploratory laparoscopy to look for endometriosis, a painful disorder in which tissue similar to the normal lining on the inside of the uterus grows on the outside. This proved to be incorrect.  In Katie’s case, she has two wombs, two cervixes and a partial vaginal septum as her birth canal is split in two almost all the way down. She said: It wasnapost until I was pregnant and having early scans that uterus didelphys was confirmed. Iaposve been told that my anatomy is one in a million.” In the early stages of pregnancy her child was growing in the left womb, but at eight weeks a second baby was found in the right womb. Two weeks later, doctors discovered the baby in her right womb had stopped growing - but the baby in the left sac was thriving. If both children had been viable, they would have been unidentical twins. \u2028 Katie added: Obviously two babies would have been so exciting but at the same time I was very nervous because itaposs rare to get to full term with just one baby with uterus didelphys, so I was worried about theof time my body would be able to carry two babies. What hurt me most was when people heard I had two wombs they would make comments like aposso you could have a baby in each wombapos. And I explained that there was a baby in each womb to start with, then people would say aposwell at least youaposve got oneapos.

Kellinu Portelli, , was trekking around the Himalayas for a cancer charity when he was found dead at the base camp. The keen runner and dad-of-two had spent the previous night at a festival, singing and dancing with locals. But when one of the guides went to wake him up the next morning, they discovered Kellinu, known as Kell, had died in his sleep. During the trip, he had been suffering from low blood oxygen levels and was being monitored by his guide. Kell had earlier messaged friends and family on Whatsapp to tell them he was feeling better.  His we Donna, , said: I said to him just be careful and he said: aposI will be careful I promiseapos. That night there was a festival on and Kell was dancing and singing with locals and then he went to bed. In the morning the guide said he went to get him but he died in his sleep. We are waiting for a post mortem but we are  per cent certain it is the low oxygen. Kell, from Leckwith, Cardf, was flown by helicopter to hospital in Kathmandu but was pronounced dead on arrival.  Donna and Kell had been married for  years and said their children Lucia, , Sam, , were heartbroken by their fatheraposs death. She said: Kell was a real family man and he adored his grandson Luca. He had been FaceTiming us from Nepal and would be crying down the phone. He was such an emotional man and heaposd cry because he missed us. But he was having a great time over there, he told his daughter it was a le-changing experience. She continued: When he was  he was quite overweight so took up running and exercise became a massive part of him. He had completed seven marathons, loads of ks and other events and would always do Parkrun.  He wanted to do Everest as he wanted to do something special, and he wanted to raise money for Marie Curie as my mum died of lung cancer and we lost a close friend to cancer last year. Over the years heaposs done lots of fundraising events and must have raised more than £, for charities. Kell flew from Heathrow  days ago and landed at Lukla Airport, Nepal, on his way to Everest Base Camp for the three-week trip. Friend David McDonald said: Kell was a family man who was born and raised in Cardf who really loved his family. He was a member of the running club and was looking forward to the trek and he had been preparing for months and months. It was such a shock not only because he was so well loved but he was tweeting away, Whatsapping people and updating Facebook until Monday night until he had low oxygen levels.They brought him down and he felt a lot better and he was Whatsapping until early evening, then he didnapost wake up from his sleep. The only thing that we can take any comfort in is that he was doing something that he always wanted to do and he was loving every moment of it.

To mark the anniversary of its completion weaposve looked back at the planning and building of the famous structure, including a last minute change of plan and why there is a hidden cave inside. Here are  interesting facts about Americaaposs shrine of democracy.    . Mount Rushmore is in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Local historian Doane Robinson came up with the idea for the sculpture to promote tourism in the local area. .  Gutzon Borglum, a famous Dutch-American sculptor, was selected for the Mount Rushmore project. After his death in March  his son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the work and it was completed later that year. . Mount Rushmore is , ft above sea level and was chosen due to its grand location, quality granite and because it faced southeast so enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun which helped maximise working hours.  . The whole project cost around £,. . Dynamite was used to carve Mount Rushmore followed by a process called aposhoneycombingapos. About , tons of stone was removed of the side of the mountain during construction. . Originally Thomas Jefferson was carved to the right of George Washington. But after  months it was decided that this wasnapost working so Jeffersonaposs face was dynamited off and his face carved on the opposite side.  . The monument is ft high. Each of the Presidentaposs heads are the height of a six-story building, their eyes are  ft across, their noses are  ft long and their mouths  ft wide. . A cave called the aposHall of Recordsapos sits behind the monument and contains a vault of  porcelain enamel  with text of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, biographies of the  presidents and Borglum, and history of the U.S. . The men who worked on the mountain were miners who had come to the Black Hills looking for gold. Although they weren’t artists, they knew how to use dynamite. Remarkably no-one died during construction.    . Mount Rushmore is now visited by more than  million people annually. . Mount Rushmore is granite, which erodes roughly  inch every , years. After about , years, the faces will likely have lost some of their definition. But at this rate the basic shape of the presidents’ heads might last up to  million years. . Mount Rushmore is illuminated every night for two hours.

Aston Hall, in Birmingham, is home to several spirits including Dick the houseboy, who hanged himself after being accused of stealing. Stunned visitors have also reported seeing a former housekeeper sitting in a chair while wearing a distinctive green dress. But the most chilling sight at the Jacobean property is aposthe grey ghostapos, believed to be Mary Holte, a daughter of the fearsome owner who was locked up in a cell at the property for  years after she tried to run away with a servant. Aston Hall was named the UKaposs most haunted heritage site in a list compiled by one of the countryaposs leading team of paranormal researchers.   Spectrum Paranormal Investigations teamed up with the National Lottery for the Halloween list to celebrate its th anniversary of supporting heritage sites.Dean Williams, from Spectrum Paranormal Investigations, said: Halloween is a time of year when many people get to enjoy their fascination with ghostly tales and paranormal experiences at historic sites across the country. In fact, anyone armed with a camera and some sound equipment can enjoy being a aposghost investigatorapos for the night. We have experienced the activity and phenomena thataposs reported at historic venues across the country, and here are ten of the best, all supported by anyone who plays The National Lottery.    Beckenham Place Park and Mansion in Lewisham, London, was second on the list. Over the years, people have supposedly spotted the presence of previous visitors and residents including soldiers and school children, while a hooded ghost has been seen floating on a lake. Castle Espie Wetland Centre in Northern Ireland was third, where a Victorian girl wrapped in a shawl has been seen carrying a baby in one hand and a flickering lantern in another. John McCullough, Castle Espie, learning manager, said: You can hear her crying out for help as she wanders the woods, looking for shelter and warmth. However, when you approach her, she slips behind a tree and disappears.  Other sites which made the list include famous venues such as the Tower of London, Tamworth Castle and Llancaiach Fawr Manor. And at Beddington Park  Grange in Croydon, the ghosts of Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth have been seen riding from the gates of Carew Manor - him with his head under his arm, and she, headless on horseback. The ten haunted heritage sites have been chosen as part of six weeks of celebrations to highlight how National Lottery players have helped preserve and enhance important heritage sites across the UK. More than £ billion has been raised for good causes since the first National Lottery draw in November  - including £ billion to over , projects to support heritage sites.  Eilish McGuinness, executive director of The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: After  years funding tens of thousands of historic sites around the UK, itaposs perhaps no surprise that a few of them have spooky tales to tell. What better time than Halloween to see some of our amazing heritage, much of which has been transformed thanks to money from the National Lottery. THE TOP TEN aposHAUNTED HISTORICapos SITES  .

HMS Urge was discovered at the bottom of the sea off Malta in the Mediterranean on Thursday. The research team from the University of Malta, which has spent  years surveying the local seas, conducted the search at the request of the grandson of the vesselaposs commander. Incredible sonar images show the U-Class submarine sitting at a depth of  metres , about two miles off the coast of Malta.    Later an unmanned ing craft confirmed the vessel with a large chunk of its bow missing. The university said the British defense ministry had reviewed their material and confirmed it was the wreck of Urge. HMS Urge set sail on April , , and had been based with other submarines in Malta where the British Navy carried out deadly mission during the World War II.    Due to the relentless German siege of the Mediterranean island, Urge failed to reach Alexandria on the agreed date of May . The  crew members,  navy personnel and a journalist went missing along with the vessel until the recent discovery. Professor Timmy Gambin, who led the mission, told Maltese broadcaster PBS: The damage to the bow shows a very violent explosion... indicating that the ship would have sunk very fast giving no chance to anybody to survive from this tragedy.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at.

The quality of the collections we have in Aberdeen, it needs a building to showcase it.”The revamped gallery, which has been hit by delays since closing its doors, will also go some way to helping the city “ersy” its economy, the council co-leader claimed.She said: “It was important to us that we made sure we provided a world-class visitor attraction that will attract not just local people but tourists from far and wide.“It’s always been our intention to make sure the redevelopment is a world-class facility.“I think that’s what we have achieved, it’s taken a bit of time but I think with the age and complexity of the project it was important we made sure we got everything right.” vw, px\"  Douglas Lumsden, who co-leads the local authority alongside Ms Laing, claimed the gallery rivals any regional gallery he has seen where.He added: “The collection we have is absolutely fantastic and we can now exhibit three times more than we could, we’ve gone up from  gallery spaces to .“We can show off a lot more and I think we’ve got a fitting gallery to host the collection we have.”The redevelopment has dramatically increased the amount of display space for the city’s nationally-recognised collection, with the number of galleries increasing from  to  and the number of items on display increasing from  to ,.Among the changes are the construction of a whole new top floor, which museum bosses say will be a “game changer”, offering “new vistas” across the city.The Remembrance Hall has also been revamped and now includes new digital rolls of honour. vw, px\"  These will scroll continuously on the wall of the hall, showing the names of everyone recorded in the city’s Book of Remembrance.Technology has been introduced across the buildings, with digital touchscreens providing more information on many of the works.Meanwhile, new LED lighting has been installed in the roof of some of the gallery space, which gives the impression of natural light and can be changed as the seasons change.Aberdeen City Council has pledged £.m from capital funds, and the National Lottery Heritage Fund has made a £m contribution but the council is still £.m short of its £m public fundraising target.Oil firm BP has donated £m to go towards its gallery space and £.m has been given by the UK Government to support the Remembrance Hall renovations.The ongoing public fundraising campaign will continue, with Mr Lumsden claiming he thinks visitors will be inspired to donate to the project once they get inside this weekend. vw, px\"  He said: “My feeling is now the gallery is open this weekend, once people come and visit, I think people will contribute to the gallery we’ve built here.“There’s still a dispute ongoing with the main contractor and that dispute will continue and we’re trying to minimise the cost to the council as much as possible.”Councillor Alex Nicoll, SNP resource spokesman, said: “The city has been robbed of its Art Gallery for far too long so I’m delighted that it will be open again very soon.“Sadly, this is not the end of the story as the administration still need to tell us how much money this project has actually cost the people of Aberdeen.”The first members of the public will get access to the gallery this weekend but tickets have sold out for the event.More than , free tickets were snapped up within hours of being released last month, with timed slots in place to ensure the best experience for visitors.From Monday, regular opening times will be am to pm Monday to Saturday and Sunday from am to pm, with free admission."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

of whom I, too, am not a fan # you give not a single example to back up your contention that he is #causing serious economic and social harm to both Argyll and Bute and Scotland as a whole#.While no-one expects the truth from politicians in general, we do actually expect it at a local level.R Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,The Scottish SPCA is urging the people of Scotland to share their stories, photos and memories of the charity as it prepares to celebrate its th birthday.Set up with the goal of aiding overworked horses and ponies in Leith, Scotland’s animal welfare charity was founded on  December .The Scottish SPCA now has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle hospital in Clackmannanshire. Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#.

As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members will decidefurther consultation and a reconsideration of this isive policy will take place.ldquoI am hoping that elected councillors will put aside their political dferences and respect the wishes of the Hawick and Borders public to make sure our children and young people have safe and secure play areas near their homes."},{"url":null,"title":"21-year-old-accused-injuring-ex","story":"A STOW man

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

doesnrsquot use it, the person who pays for it wishes it wasnrsquot needed. What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

His father John was a director at Lyon  Turnbull, auctioneers and valuators on George Street. His mother Sybil was a well-known character in her own right, known by many as Sybs, Squibs and Grandma Swag.Melvin attended Melville College but left at the age of  as school wasnrsquot for him. He was more interested in his mumrsquos Vogue magazines.He got his first job soon after at His Hair, which started his love of hairdressing. He moved onto Charlie Miller, where he didnrsquot get off to the best start: Charlie told his father that Melvin would be better off working as a plumber.But Charlie saw Melvinrsquos passion and decided thathe wanted to be a hairdresser he should go train with the best, so in the early s he supported Melvin so he could go to London and train at Vidal Sassoon.During his time in London he got the opportunity to work on high-profile projects such as wigs for singer Diana Ross. Other famous clients included La Toya Jackson, Dustin Hoffman and Shirley Bassey, who famously threw a shoe at him.In  he entered the first Scottish Wella Vogue competition, winning with his creation of tartan hair. He was featured in the national and international press, on national TV, and even appeared in Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines.He was asked to go to America with Vidal Sassoon but he wanted to come home so moved back to Edinburgh. With the support of his family he opened Melvin  Friends in November  on the cityrsquos Castle Street.His philosophy was always lsquoHairdressing Naturallyrsquo and he believed in using biodegradable products not tested on animals.The business expanded and he opened salons in many places including Alnwick, Peebles and several in and around Edinburgh. He even opened a salon in the Sheraton Hotel.In , Melvin became the proud father of Oliver, who filled the air with fun and laughter, having many happy times growing up.In , Melvin met Lorna through a mutual friend.

When North Berwick High School had a hair training salon, he held sessions on the basics of hairdressing.Many stories could be told about his days in the salon, like when golfrsquos The Open Championship was held and top player Vijay Singh came in for a cut.Melvin, not being a golfer, did not know who he was, but they got chatting and Vijay said he was here for golf, so Melvin very kindly recommended some of the courses his customers had told him about!During the early days, Melvin could be found at the townrsquos Nether Abbey Hotel sometimes as a customer but sometimes as the chef as he had a great love for cooking.Many happy times were spent there and many parties were had, where Melvin was given access to the kitchens and, along with friends, did the catering.For his th birthday, he cooked for  friends.He was also famous every year for his barbecues held at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune during its airshow.Melvin liked people to appreciate his food he would make lunch for the girls who worked in the salon, just liking to see them eat and enjoy. He taught Hannah to cook and was so proud of what she produced in the kitchen.Added his we: ldquoMelvin was a great dad, he was fun and made sure he did fun things with his children. He was so proud of me and them, and would brag about what they had achieved, often embellishing the stories.ldquoHe was a wonderful, loving husband who really looked after me.ldquoHe grabbed le with a passion and helived every day to the full, which is a great comfort.

But the one that may be most instructive, as the parties line up with their manestos, and we attempt to get some settled verdict on Brexit and its economic consequences, is the th anniversary of the final day of the Wall Street Crash, which marked the start of the Great Depression.Despite the attention devoted to this period, which affected every developed nation for more than a decade, and made the austerity programmes of the past few years look like Viv Nicholson singing Big Spender in a luxury car showroom, no one agrees, even now, on the lessons to be learnt from it.Reckless speculation, easy credit, an asset price bubble, government intervention, protectionism and failures of the banking system were the main components, but even so some economists argue that the Wall Street Crash wasnrsquot the real cause of the Depression .If all of that seems vaguely familiar, itrsquos because it happened again notably  years ago, on Black Monday, when the Dow Jones had its largest-ever one-day drop and . trillion dollars was wiped off the world economy. If that seems too distant, itrsquos just  years ago this month that Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, and the bail-out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those were the US government-backed outfits which were supposed to provide security for the mortgage market ndash and were themselves set up in the s under the New Deal designed to end the Depression.And where are we after the Great Recession the  crash sparked  Practically nothing seems to have changed. The nationalised banks are back in private ownership, continuing to pay enormous bonuses and generally behaving as they did before. The UKrsquos national debt, . per cent of GDP in , is now . per cent of GDP, or about pound. trillion. About  per cent of bonds issued globally ndash  trillion worth ndash actually guarantee a loss, something that may remind you of the creative packaging of subprimedebt that kicked off the last crisis. A decade on, interest rates and growth are still on the floor, deflation looms, and monetary policy is broken.The response of the political parties to this state of affairs ishellip to promise to spend money like water. Unsurprisingly, Jeremy Corbynrsquos plans are the worst: Labourrsquos proposed nationalisations have been costed at pound billion just to set up, even before the companies concerned start losing money, as state-run firms tend to while there will be lots more money for all the usual suspects, such as the NHS, schools, and public sector workers.But even the parties that donrsquot advocate the full Venezuela treatment have absurdly expensive plans. The SNPrsquos fiscal estimates, so critical when it comes to Brexit or Westminster, go sharply into starry-eyed optimism when it suits them. The Tories, who correctly insisted that austerity was necessary, are now finding money all over the placefor plans of dubious value, like HS, or Borisrsquos peculiar enthusiasm for very expensive bridges.The battle of economic ideas that used to ide the parties has been displaced by political issues such as Brexit or Scottish independence. These, of course, have economic elements, but they are intrinsically unknowable and cheerfully ignored, skewed, inflated or played down by all sides, because their commitment is partisan, rather than an assessment of economic reality.We hear endlessly of the likely catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit, for example, but very little about Germanyrsquos current industrial crisis, the continuing fissures in the Eurozone, or the fact that both Italy and Francersquos real economy debt puts them on the verge of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the Tories are already promising to spend hypothetical benefits of trade deals that donrsquot yet exist.Alas, any election will be dominated by political issues, such as the competence of the leaders, accusations of obstruction, claims to represent ldquothe people and, God help us, Brexit and independence. All the parties, on current form, will offer the Moon on a stick, with no regard to the cost. Every party, even the incumbents, will also go heavily for the first of the campaign priorities James Carville devised for Bill Clinton: ldquoChange, versus more of the same. Itrsquos a shame that the second message Carville realised you had to push to win an election credibly ndash ldquoItrsquos the economy, stupid ndash wonrsquot get a look in."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10606509.jpg?type=article-full","title":"new-poll-reveals-support-snp-scottish-independence","story":"Our latest survey of readerrsquos views found that more than half, . per cent, intend to vote for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos party at the General Election on December , followed by .% for the Conservatives and .% for the Liberal Democrats.Just .% of our readers questioned in the pollintend to vote for Labour, who have suffered a bruisingtime in Scotland in recent years.However, % of people who responded to the poll said they had changed their political allegiance since the last General Election, although they did not specy to which party.:Iain Macwhirter: Rude awakening ahead in the nightmare before ChristmasThe poll of more than , readers also found that they back staying in the EU and want to see an independent Scotland.If there was a second referendum on leaving the EU, % said they would back remain compared to .% who would leave with just .% undecided.This is a considerable move from the % Leave % Remain vote in  across the UK, and higher than the % Remain to % Leave vote in Scotland.:Being an Englishman in Glasgow has changed my views on independenceIn a second Scottish Independence referendum, almost % back Yes to Scotland becoming a fully-fledged country compared to a No vote of %, with fewer than  % undecided.This is a considerable turnaround for the % No vote, % Yes vote at the referendum in .:Nicola Sturgeon calls out Laura Kuenssberg over Scottish independence rally tweetTrust in politicians at Westminster is hard to find among our readers ndash with almost % saying they did not trust MPs.

With the aid of ten election dorsquos and donrsquots ndash let us call them commandments in keeping with the seasonrsquos biblical theme ndash we can get through this with our sanity clauses intact . Here goes:DO: Set up an official, impartial, fact checking service that can give a ruling on the avalanche of claims and counterclaims coming votersrsquo way. Yesterdayrsquos PMQs, with a row over the involvement of American firms in the NHS, was just a flavour of what is to come. At this moment, somewhere in the UK, claims are being painted on the sides of buses and voters need to know who and what to trust. Let the official fact checker dispense with the traditional ldquoon the one hand on the other fuddy-duddy formalities. In this fast-moving age a simple thumbs up, thumbs down will do. No appeals, no refunds, harsh but fair.: Poll shows support for SNP and independenceDONrsquoT: Let us tolerate streams of political cliches masquerading as answers to specic questions. Any interview in which a politician says, ldquoLet me be clear, ldquoWe have always been clear, or any iety thereof, will be terminated immediately and the culprit fined. Likewise, experts, back in fashion since Westminsterrsquos implosion, starting sentences with the word, ldquoSo.DO: Feel free to be a switcher in this General Election. The current Westminster parliament has been notable for the large number of politicians, some  according to the BBCrsquos PM programme, who have switched sides or found themselves suddenly independent. Voters may like to follow their examples and dispense with old loyalties as they see fit. Outwith Scotland, the Tories entire election strategy depends on leopards changing their spots. In general, and due in part to Brexit creating new allegiances, a lot of soul searching will be going on as pens hover above ballot papers. As a result of switching this could be a fiendishly dficult election to call.DONrsquoT: Take Scotland for granted. Goes for all parties, but particularly the SNP, widely expected to sweep the board in Scotland. No sooner had an election date been named than some in the party were framing the General Election as mainly a way to advance independence. Not only is this a risky strategy that could repel as many voters as it attracts, there is a whf of arrogance about it, too. Voters here want to talk about schools, the NHS, the economy and so on as much as voters in the rest of the UK. They have genuine concerns that must be heard. To assume otherwise is to believe wrongly that all is well here, save for a lack of independence. See the history of Labour in Scotland, or the seats lost in the  General Election, for further information on the perils of assuming support is in the bag.: SNP reliant on voters in EnglandDO: Be nice to canvassers. Yes, it is a pain in the neck to have your evening interrupted, but it is an essential part of the ing of democracy. Information is exchanged between parties and voters, sometimes in fairly spirited terms, and pressure released. After the last three years we could all do with some of that. Remember, too, that it is cold outside and it takes some commitment to a cause to go out there ldquoon the knock. Not for nothing was fleece -lined clothing trending last night.DONrsquoT: On the subject of social media, it might be a good time to remind BBC journalists, and one in particular, hello Laura, to pause before they tweet, such is the number of Twitter ldquospats they have been in lately.The latest erupted this week when the BBCrsquos political editor wrongly said the SNP had called a rally in Glasgow this Saturday as part of gearing up for an election. In fact, the event has been organised by The National, The Heraldrsquos sister paper, and has been in the pipeline for months. Ms Kuenssberg, to her credit, issued a correction. Next time, for there surely will be one, remember it is better to be right than quick.DO: Hope that broadcasters, in the run up to polling day on December , find ways of covering politics that prove more enlightening than the current stale models.Heated debates, with  of mostly men shouting at each other, or audience members shouting at them, does nothing to aid anyonersquos understanding. Broadcasters have the upper hand in what is certain to be a campaign with more key players than usual vying for attention. Use it to insist on extended, one-to-one interviews, or follow the American example and have small  quizzing debate participants rather than large audiences. Panels are easier to vet, thus avoiding the inevitable rows when seemingly impartial questioners turn out to be not quite as advertised.: Rude awakening ahead for Johnson DONrsquoT: Forget there is le after politics. Some of it can even be fun.

This has been done in what in what is normally referred to as the Queenrsquos Speech. It is in studying the contents we have to realise that the author, the Prime Minister, is someone not normally associated with either in-depth scrutiny or attention to detail. To put it another way the manestorsquos headlines do not represent the contents.Nothing is more evident than the claim to recruit , more police officers. Although this does not relate to Scotland nevertheless it is a prime example of double talk. In stating , more police in three years there is a suggestion being made that in the three-year period England and Wales will have this number of additional officers. However even the slightest amount of scrutiny lies bare the nonsense of this claim.To recruit this number in three years would require a Herculean task of actually interviewing sufficient, capable people to take up these vacancies. The interviewing process is long and arduous and with preference being given to graduates will present the police forces with a huge logistical nightmare. The normal fallout from the interview process can be up to  per cent so maybe , interviews would have to be carried out to arrive at the headline number.However, let us assume, in a spirit of charity, that somehow this task can be accomplished and the interviews completed and in three years , new officers will have been recruited. The average working le of an officer is  years so in three years ten per cent of the present force of , will have retired. Or to put it another way , officers will have left the force. So even recruiting , more officers had been accomplished, this would result in only a net gain of , additional cops. The headline and the detail simply do not add up. If Boris Johnson were looking to improve the service, then the solution would lie in increasing the budget appropriately. This he will not do.This is merely one example. However similar forensic investigation of all the contents of the Queens Speech will show that Mr Johnson is selling nothing other than fairy tales.George Kay, Burntisland.THE Herald poll which shows overwhelming support for the SNP at the upcoming General Electionis a mark of the trust voters have in the party which has been in power in Scotland for  years, and a growing realisation that Scotland will thrive as an independent European nation.While the SNP Government calmly carries on, the UK is into its third Tory Prime Minister in about as many years David Cameron didnt hang around after losing the EU referendum hed instigated, Theresa May soon found that Brexit didnt mean Brexit and we werent going to make a success of it and Boris Johnson eclipsed the pair of them by insisting that do or die, we were leaving the EU on October  and hed rather be dead in a ditch than ask for an extension. Neither Mr Johnson nor anyone  is leaving on October  and while he may not be in a ditch, Mr Johnson is certainly busy digging himself and his party into a hole.While a General Election may have been inevitable, the timing could hardly have been much worse, with the Christmas season getting into full swing and just over a week before the shortest day even holding it a few days earlier would have been helpful, particularly to the student population. And it is a huge blow that the amendment was not taken which, as is the case at Scottish elections, would have given voting rights to EU nationals living in the UK and enfranchised  and -year-olds, who will have to live with the consequences of Brexit without being given any say in the matter.I fear that we can expect Mr Johnsons General Election campaign to emulate the notorious Vote Leave campaign with pledges on the side of a bus et al, so it is encouraging that your poll indicates that Scottish voters wont be duped by this guiser of a Prime Minister and his Halloween tricks and no treats.Ruth Marr, Stirling.AS we gear up to a December election, the first economic assessment of Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal has indicated the incredibly damaging impact it will have on the UK economy.Research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchhas revealed that GDP would be . per cent lower in  yearsrsquo time under the deal, leaving the UK a staggering pound billion worse off than we had remained in the EU.This is not quite the ldquosunny uplands the Brexiters have repeatedly promised.NIESR said approval of the Prime Ministerrsquos deal ldquowould reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU. However, despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ldquohinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would bethe UK stayed in the EU.The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa Mayrsquos deal of last year.When voters mark their X in the box, these figures lay bare the economic future that faces the nation and the major impact that their choice will have.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon has agreed to a General Election to further her own political aims. Has she miscalculated  The SNP is standing on a  to cancel Brexit and allow indyref but the two are mutually exclusive. If Brexit does not take place, the foremost \"material change in circumstances\" that triggered the need for indyref disappears. Many SNP supporters who still want Brexit to happen will be in the position of having to vote for a pro-Brexit party. Those wanting to remain in both the Union and the EU can find security with the Liberal Democrats. The pro-independence position is therefore weakened and even more so as the SNPs warnings on a climate emergency might boost those voting Green.The SNP hype, up until now, is for almost a total victory in all Scottish seats to be in the bag. The expectation is being ramped up, therefore disappointment is almost inevitable. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon ought to have declined Boris Johnsons invitation after all.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.AS they say, politicians campaign in poetry but have to govern in prose. Flamboyant promises fill the airwaves, restraint only coming into play when the serious business of taking office hits home.The starting pistol for a Christmas election has been fired.This is no ordinary election where policies are put on display, allowing the electorate to vote for the party most trusted by voters. The waters have been muddied by the inclusion of Brexit on the normal agenda in the hope that the result will finally define the direction demanded by the choice of the winning party.We have two contrasting personalities leading the two main parties.Both are pale imitations of the two giants of their parties, Boris Johnson representing a Churchillian figure, Jeremy Corbyn approximating to Attlee.What cannot be denied is that this election is a battle for the soul of Britain, one side the champion of neo-liberal economics, the other verging on responsible capitalism under the guise of socialism.That is the stark choice facing the voters, who will have to wade through the murky rhetoric to work out which campaign they should choose to ensure viability for their families and personal welfare.That will mean looking beyond narrow self-interest and focusing on the broader perspective of what is better for the national interest.They will have to ignore the caricatures painted for them by the wild words of politicians hoping to depict their opponents in the worst possible light.This is a generation-defining election.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.I REFER to the ongoing furore about the career of Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives .I recall from a comment that one writer made that she was resigning to spend more time with her family he also pointed out that she was actually resigning to spend more time with her constituents, which she had not actually done heretofore.As the story developed, she was really to be spending more time with her consultants, Tulchan and her own consultancy company.Ms Davidson has now agreed not to accept the role with Tulchan what she will do with her own company is not known as she omitted to properly register it, and someone  has registered the domain name. Her failure to register her own company shows a distinct lack of business sense, where the Tulchan episode just shows her lack of common sense.On a related matter the Scottish Tories are producing election leaflets with her pictureshe actually stood down because she fundamentally disagreed with the Prime Minister, Boris Johnston ndash she did launch ldquoOperation Arse about his candidacy, did she not  Strange indeed that she and the Tory Party are now punting him as hard as they can.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH.FOLLOWING on from your article re Ruth Davidsons pamphlet to the East Renfrewshire electorate: today I received one from our local Conservative MP, well I think it was.

The fact that it is a part of indigenous Maori culture which has been embraced by all races in New Zealand, makes it a special and unique tradition to be celebrated and admired.Recently, when a friendrsquos -year-old son was leaving a New Zealand school after coaching rugby there for a year, I confess to shedding a wee tear as she showed me video of the hundred or so multiracial students performing the haka as a mark of respect for their coach.It is moving and fierce, powerful and evocative, hypnotic and surprising all at the same time. Itrsquos an ancient tradition that has survived the inexorable push towards the homogeneity of Hollywood culture. For that, I think, it deserves a little respect, not smirking, rule-breaking or attempts to drown it out with renditions of ldquoSwing Low, Sweet Chariot.Of course, therersquos an argument to say that the aim was not to disrespect. I mean, we all make mistakes when it comes to othersrsquo culture, rituals and customs, when we simply donrsquot know what is expected of us. lsquoItrsquos no biggiersquo as my kids would say.I have a litany of experience of this. One episode stands out. A few years ago, a Muslim cousin of mine got married to a Sikh. Although the families originated from within  miles of one another on the Indian subcontinent, neither had read the non-existent copy of A Very Handy Guide to Wedding Rituals.The result was a stand-off outside a Scottish country house on the one baking hot day of , that lasted for a painful  minutes, as neither side knew what they should do: a standoff so scary, it put the Soviet American standoff at Checkpoint Charlie in  to shame. We just had no idea what each others rituals were - do we shake hands, exchange gts, we had garlands but who was to put it on whom And it seems Irsquom not alone in my experience of faux pas when it comes to rituals. A Jewish friend recently told me of aat a synagogue where the dferent types of food on the table were carefully chosen to signy certain elements of the past. A soft and gooey food called Charoset signied the cement used by the Jewish slaves in building, and bowls of salted water signied the tears and sweat of those slaves. Just as one man was about to drink the much respected salted water, a non Jewish visitor plunged his hands into the bowl, and started vigorously washing them. Maybe itrsquos the disregard for the rules by the team thatrsquos ripping my knitting. Few, and certainly it seems, not even the All Blacks themselves, argue that a response to the haka is not acceptable, but itrsquos the disregard for authority, the we-know-better than officialdom, which smacks of something more potentially worrying.World Rugby Regulations insist that opponents must stay in their half when the haka is being performed. Some of the England team entered the other half, but yet even with officials shouting at them to get back, they continued to do so. Their fans lapped it up - England won, so perhaps the means justied the glorious end.But is that really a justication for breaking the rules  Most of us teach our kids to obey the rules - at home, in school, on the sports field. Itrsquos part of growing up - being aware of a kind of social contract between us all in gameplay.Elite sportsmen and women are role models for millions of young people and children and to keep sport respected in this way the governing bodies have to formulate rules which canrsquot be seen to be ignored. By flouting the rules, and the subsequent validation of the rule-breaking by fans and pundits alike afterwards, did the English team tap into a zeitgeisty thing wersquore seeing a lot more of at the moment  pound is thought to be the cost to the team - an insignicant loss for making their lsquoVrsquo shaped point.So yes, although stuff happens, the response of the England team was no mistake. It was pre-meditated and for me, showed a lack of respect to the ancient tradition. But hey! What do I know  Irsquom just a woman still traumatised by being in a face-off nine years ago between  Glaswegian Muslims and  Sikhs from Gravesend.Now,one, or both sides had started doing the haka - that would have been interesting."},{"url":null,"title":"line-dutys-martin-compston-among-scottish-bafta-attendees","story":"They will be joined by Still Game creators Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill,

Winners and losersMany butterflies - particularly those that don’t rely on specic food plants to survive - are benefiting from higher summer temperatures, increasing in numbers and spreading northwards to populate areas that would have previously been too cold. But milder, wetter winters are having the opposite effect on other species.Winners include the ringlet, peacock, orange-tip, small skipper, Essex skipper, white-letter hairstreak and small heath. Seasonal visitors to the country, such as the well-known red admiral, have also increased as a result of warmer weather.: Rare spectacle as clouds of butterflies appear in ‘once-in-a-decade’ invasionHowever, despite no overall change since records began in , some habitat-specic breeds have been disappearing.The grayling, which prefers to live in coastal areas such as dunes, saltmarshes and clfs, has seen UK numbers crash by nearly  per cent in four decades.Small tortoiseshell and small copper colonies have also decreased.Conversely, other specialist species, including the small pearl-bordered fritillary and pearl-bordered fritillary, rose signicantly.Wetter wintersExperts believe a combination of factors, including the spread of urbanisation, changing land use and the effects of climate change, are behind the trend.Recent research has shown that warmer and rainier winters are having a particularly bad effect on some of the insects, including the small tortoiseshell. The report also shows that butterflies in Scotland are generally doing better than their counterparts south of the border.“While butterfly populations in Scotland have remained stable overall, a closer look at the data reveals that climate change is impacting dferently on dferent species,” said Simon Foster, trends and indicators analyst for Scottish Natural Heritage.: Rare butterflies ‘thriving’ in Highlands“While the range of some established or expanding butterfly populations has been pushed northwards as a result of warming summers, other species are struggling to cope.“We know that nature-based solutions are crucial to helping us tackle the climate emergency, and together with partners we are working on a range of projects to help pollinators such as butterflies.”Helping butterfliesBut he says members of the public can also do their bit to help struggling species.“Planting butterfly-friendly native plants can help populations locally, and leaving nettles alone will ensure an essential food plant for small tortoiseshells,” he said.“Providing a nice dry area such as a log pile or an old shed left partly open can also provide essential overwintering conditions for small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies.”The Scottish Bioersity Indicator - Butterflies is a multi-species index compiled by Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology  Hydrology, using data primarily from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"when a focus group heard this fact about brexit there was horrified silence alex cole hamilton msp","story":"The public are being duped over Brexit by both the Tories and the SNP, writes Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP.Somewhere, in a windowless room of a national opinion polling organisation, the answers offered by a recent focus group uncovered a worrying reality.When asked a series of questions about Boris Johnson’s new Brexit ‘deal’ the carefully selected cross-section of the UK public demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is actually going on. The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu citizens in scotland not applying for settled status due to incredulity mike

the Scottish Parliaments European Committee, said Home Office data showed applications for settled status are \"signicantly lower\" north of the Border, with only about  per cent of people having applied, compared to a UK rate of about  per cent.Mr Russell said one reason for this could be their \"incredulity\" at having to apply to remain in the UK post-Brexit, a process he described as \"offensive\" and \"very wounding\".The Brexit secretary told the committee that ongoing uncertainty means \"overall this is a dficult and very worrying time for EU citizens who live in Scotland\".He

is the key thing which people wish.\": General election : SNP set to be snubbed in plans for three TV debatesOn the lower number of applications for settled status from Scotland, he said some of this could be linked to the temporary nature of some types of work such as in the agricultural sector.Mr Russell said: \"It could also be peoples incredulity that this is required of them, and a feeling that as Scotland is dferent then they dont need to do so.\"Ive been very clear, the Government has been very clear and we want to be very clear again here today, the Scottish Governments advice to EU

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2398342.jpg--.jpg?1572422110000\n","title":"hallowena party at people s park","story":"Prepare to be spooked this year’s brand new Halloween event in People’s Park, Ballymena.It is one of the biggest, scariest nights of the year and ‘Hallowena’ plans to serve up some fang-tastic surprises which will be sure to raise those goosebumps.The event, on October , will be a real scream with some creepy characters roaming the grounds of People’s Park.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of fireworks, a huge walking dragon, fire jugglers, a haunted marquee, scary story tellers, a kiddies funfair and live music.It kicks off at pm and last scream dies away at .pm.Popular live act, The Coves, will perform a full live set on the music stage following a mix of Halloween stompers from DJ Brian Reynolds.

Katie is often helped on her litter picks by Eila and her four year old son Reuben She said: “If my little girlis capable of walking down our road gathering up people’s rubbish which they have selfishly cast from their cars, surely those adults driving the cars can be capable of holding on to their rubbish until they get to a bin. The rural roads around Ballymena are a disgrace.”Katie came across the cat recently during the school run.She said: “Less than  hours after we did the clean-up of our road we came across this poor wee cat caught in a crisp packet just around the corner from us, as we did the school run. This wee creature had totally given up and was just crouched at the roadside, waiting for death. “I pulled the bag off, and it sat stunned for a moment, gasping for breath, before it ran off, terried.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup olive branch to nationalists on irish language","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Terry Wright, former Vice Chair of the UUP that unionism must jettison treating Brexit solely as a constitutional watershed and move towards a transformed Northern Ireland.  Since government determined solely by a headcount Unionist majority in Northern Ireland proved unsustainable, Unionism has faced a number of internal crises resulting from actions by Westminster governments. Deemed unpalatable and unacceptable, many of these have been met, not with creative strategies but with protest, strident but ineffective pseudo-sectarian - posturing and, on the basis of where unionism stands today, flawed decision-making resulting from deceptive election results and occasionally favourable arithmetic in the House of Commons. googletag.cmd.push Content to agonise rather than organise, Unionism has travelled unerringly down the road of its own failings to become a danger to the Union. It seems that Brexit could soon claim a place as yet another milestone. Whilst the Brexit process, even after three years and more, remains in limbo, with Parliament still to sign off a final Withdrawal Agreement, No Deal, People’s Vote or General Election before detailed trade negotiations can begin, political Unionism is not well-placed. Characterised by disarranged and expedient strategic thinking, it seems ill equipped for relevant political discourse even with the broader pro-Union constituency, many of whom see a need to re-evaluate long held positions. Unionism has moved beyond an age of careless and stereotypical single labels. Within the pro-Union constituency identities are hyphenated and erse. Some identy as pro-Union, economic-unionist, civic-unionist, liberal-unionist and cultural-unionist or a fluid combination of two or more to ying degrees. A large proportion voted to remain in the EU and, in an increasingly personalised society, have no major issues with the delivery of marriage equality, the de-criminalisation of abortion and the provision of choice within ethical parameters. They also see a need to reach accommodation and exercise perspective without bias on rights, cultural and language issues which currently serve as a forum for mutually exclusive combat between the two major parties. In pursuit of their Brexit strategies, the unionist parties, mainly the DUP, instead of engaging in the modern issue-centred discourse which the debate requires, have been content to wrongly categorise Brexit as mainly a constitutional issue and rely on the de-sensitisation of its constituency to the blurred truth, spin and inaccuracies promoted by the Leave campaign. In an act of collective self-deception, it took a reckless gamble with the future and has served to produce the opposite of what it claimed to prioritise with ergence from the remainder of the United Kingdom, a situation which is not itself unusual for the DUP and other Unionists. It grasped an opportunity to wring money from Westminster and allied itself closely to a questionably optimistic pro-Brexit  but in so doing, failed to address the broader ramications of what Brexit could mean for Northern Ireland, socially, culturally and crucially, in terms of reconciliation and stability. It ignored not just the large and erse Remain vote but Unionists, already disenchanted by lack of movement on social issues and concerned by economic and political uncertainty. Had it explored the possibilities within the Good Friday Agreement structures which it now so vigorously defends and embraced the North-South Bodies more energetically, a process might have produced an internalised all-island solution with EU endorsement which facilitated preferred aspirations. Notably, the Ulster Unionist Party moved belatedly toward this position. Now, presented by proposals it does not like, yet facilitated through its tactics, the main party of unionism seems likely to adopt the default position of retrenchment to a place of fear and resistance. Abandoned by erstwhile friends in Westminster who are the epitome of political insincerity and who, seeing Northern Ireland as a handicap to Brexit, have made their priorities clear, this seems a forlorn hope likely to add to the current sadness of spirit within unionism flowing from the trickle-down dys of the DUP leadership. The DUP engaged in a mutually commodied accommodation more to do with opportunism than leadership and the outcome could be predicted. Communal conflict has remained in the minds of too many of its political leaders and this, allied to narrow defensive and cultural politics has led unionism, already discredited by expense scandals which lay bare the moral and pampered relativism of unionist politicians, into a cul-de-sac. As many voters, no longer prepared to be associated with political mediocrity abandon the toxic terminology and one agenda politics of unionist to opt for a pro-Union identity, political unionism needs a re-boot. Those who wish to lead could begin with a robust analysis of the turmoil and abandon the self-deception that Northern Ireland is a place where the will of a unionist majority can always prevail. Unionism is living in the long shadow of Home Rule where diminishing support at Westminster with demographic and changing generational profiles in Northern Ireland indicate that the maintenance of a pro-Union position is no longer guaranteed on the basis of a communal headcount and rests on persuasion for a preferred future. A post-Brexit world that will present challenges is unpredictable, but unionism must look for opportunities that may also present to re-generate. Too often it has lacked an ear for the wrong notes. The Brexit deal which Boris Johnston has brought back from Brussels with its proposals for Northern Ireland bears all the hallmarks of effective lobbying by a business sector, supported by Remain parties, anxious to protect trade and explore opportunities for growth but the obvious uncertainty and confusion of Ministers indicates cause for concern and that all the boxes are not yet ticked that Northern Ireland could be worse off than at present. The clumsy manner in which the values and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement are appearing to be compromised and thrown over by Westminster only serves to tighten the knots. To meet the challenges, Unionism needs to inject stability and focus on a shared future to address the developing situation and build a consensus to solve potential problems across and within regulatory and alignment areas. Livelihoods and public services depend on this being resolved. Now is the time for problem-solving coalitions to build an Agreed Northern Ireland. It will not be achieved by tokenistic changes of label from traditional to expedient grandstanding on second-hand radical liberalismyou still enable sectarianism, segregation and prejudice. The values and attitudes which inform actions are how unionism will be measured and it is presently found wanting by large swathes of its constituency. Substance will always be more important than style and it is the only ethical basis on which you can create the conditions for the realisation of political ideas. Late in the day, Unionism can benefit by sharing responsibility for creating a transformed Northern Ireland and abandoning any desire to dominate the old. Brexit seems to be consigning the dying embers of that particular flame to the dustbin.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

Two days later, two further sinkholes appeared, and a huge split broke the pitch in half and spread to the clubhouse and car park. The grounds were immediately shut down, and the misery was compounded a few weeks later when the club were relegated from senior football for the first time in  years.This season they have made use of alternate venues as the work continues to re-establish their own home, with a GoFundMe page raising tens of thousands towards the project. The club – who have appeared in six of the last  Monaghan Senior Club Championship finals, with the most recent appearance in  – have secured their position back in the senior ranks for next season, but first they must deal with the business of Ulster.For Foreglen, it’s a familiar position. At the start of the Derry championship they were ranked as dark horses, but were few people’s out and out favourites. Bar a first round replay against Faughanvale they barely faltered on the way to the showpiece, but still there were few in their corner against Claudy. It mattered little as they held the Mitchel’s to one score – a free – in the second half to claim a - to - win. O’Brien’s coach Muldoon believes they can take serious confidence not just from the result, but from the nature of the performance.“I think after the replay with Faughanvale, as the championship went on our confidence just got better and better and we’re going into this game now off the back of a big performance,” the Ballinderry man told the Derry Post. “My team talks are very brief before a game because we do the work in training. The boys know on the day what they have to do, who they’re marking, what the plan is for kick outs – it’s all organised.“We’ll sit down this week and look at Magheracloone. There’s not a lot of information or videos out there but we’ll get our planning done and be ready for the challenge. It will probably be a case of giving it five or ten minutes and then making the switches that we need to.“It’s bonus territory for us, and it’s unknown territory too. We know they’re going to be a very good, strong side and we’re expecting a tough challenge but it’s one that we’re all looking forward to.”From the scenes on the pitch in Celtic Park after their victory two weeks ago to the social media posts from Foreglen clubhouse in the following days, the togetherness of the whole community has come to the fore. Even as a man not from the club, Muldoon said it was something special, and something they’d like to repay. “After the final whistle I stood back and saw my two boys running onto the pitch in their Foreglen tops and I shed a tear. They’re a small parish, and I know a lot of them are the same, but in that clubhouse on the Sunday night, I’d never seen a crowd like it. “We said to the lads last week that when it came to Ulster there was a choice to train a few times or put the heads down and give it a rattle. We want to set an example for the county and to be fair they’ve put the shoulder to the wheel for their community.“It’s a day out for everyone to jump on a bus together and head down. Who knows what’s going to happen, but we’ll all be sticking together as a team and with the supporters and we’ll give it everything for them.” googletag.cmd.push FORGET ODDSDespite all their dficulties last year, Magheracloone still managed to reach the senior championship semi-final, defeated by eventual title winners Scotstown. The enormity of the task at hand isn’t lost on Muldoon, but he insisted that the underdog tag hasn’t been an issue for his men so far – they’re relishing it.“We’ve been happy enough to take the underdogs tag. Before the Claudy game there were a lot of people who thought we had no chance, but we didn’t care,” he insisted. “The boys all got it out of their heads and we focused on ourselves.“To be fair, Claudy were rightly favourites because they were head and shoulders above anyone in the league, but we knew what we were about and we knew what we were doing. The whole favourites thing is all part of the build-up, but we won’t read too much into it this time either.”Both played five championship matches on their way to their provincial titles, with the Monaghan side both scoringand concedingmore than Foreglen, who scored - and conceded -. Even with county level players like Gavin Doogan and Tomas Freeman on the other side, Muldoon reiterated his faith in the O’Brien’s defence, and he feels the forward line can take confidence knowing that they will get opportunities.“In training and in all our games we have the same set up – it’s man to man marking, no sweepers and no hiding places, and we’ve no plans to change that,” explained the coach. “In the build-up to the final nobody was giving our defence any credit, it was all about the Claudy forwards, and vice versa about our attack.“Our defence is tight, the boys talk to one another, you have the likes of Oisin and Shane Duffy in there and they’re all told what to be doing before the game. Them boys don’t have the cover of a sweeper, but they do their job, they back themselves against their man and they have confidence as a unit.”For the seasoned professionals like Oisin Duffy, Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor, the pressure of an Ulster quarter-final won’t weigh too heavy on the shoulders, but Muldoon said he is particularly delighted that the younger squad members, like Liam O’Hara, Sean, Cahir and Caolan O’Connor, have all shown that they can handle the mental pressure of the big occasion. It’s a quality he feels will stand them in good stead come Sunday afternoon.“I sat down on the Saturday night before the game with Claudy and rang some of them young lads and said to them that I knew what they were feeling, and they’d got us there through talent and enthusiasm. They worked hard all year in the gym, but they had to go out and treat it as any other game,” he explained. “In fairness to them they did, and I thought every one of them were immense. “Now getting the chance to play in Ulster – it’s a brilliant experience for them young cubs and it’s one that will definitely stand to them.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Co. Tyrone mumpreneurs - Joanne Gallagher and Stephanie Rice – launched Good Vibes in their home town of Strabane in June this year, after identying a gap in the market for alternative and holistic treatments in the town. Joanne said, “I felt the benefits of alternative and holistic treatments personally and wanted to know more, so after much research I trained to become a Meditation Coach, Reiki Master and NLP Practitioner. “I have always been passionate about wellness and in recent years have practised privately, offering holistic treatments such as reiki and meditation to clients who experience symptoms including anxiety, stress, aches and pains, among other things.“I feel passionately about the benefits of alternative therapy and since Stephanie, my best friend from secondary school also practised within the field, it just made sense for us to join forces.”Joanne and Stephanie offer a iety of alternative therapies, including reflexology, massage, meditation and yoga in a safe and friendly environment that allows clients to explore which practice works best for them. Joanne and Stephanie welcome a wide range of clients to their studio, from alternative therapy veterans to those who are new to holistic healing techniques. Stephanie, who is a reflexologist, Indian head masseuse and Aromatherapy Specialist and plans to train as a yoga teacher next Spring. Said: “Helping others is something I have always loved doing. I am passionate about alternative therapies and have experienced first-hand the effect these, combined with the power of positivity, can have. “Opening my own business was something I had always dreamed of and with Joanne also working within the industry, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for us to partner up to bring the dream to le. Joanne and Stephanie turned their idea for a business into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies.The Go For It Programme, provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn people’s ideas for a business into a commercial enterprise.Stephanie commented, “We had the passion for health and wellbeing, but beyond our qualications and training we didn’t know how to put it all together into a sustainable business model. That’s where the Go For It Programme came in and really helped us. “The programme helped us with everything from marketing strategies to financial planning. The Business Advisors were very attentive and explained everything to us in great detail, and we both felt really informed and supported throughout the whole process. With the help of the programme, we were really supported to set up the business.Orla McNulty, business adviser with Strabane Enterprise Agency on behalf of Derry City and Strabane District Council, said, “It was a pleasure to assist Joanne and Stephanie in the start-up stage of their business. They have a real passion for health and wellbeing and that passion for helping others really underpins their business ethos. ““I sat down with Joanne and Stephanie and together we planned a clear strategy for their business start-up. A business plan was developed with detailed financial forecasts, marketing strategies and addressed legal issues.”“I’m delighted to see that the business is thriving for the ladies, with so many people availing of the fantastic services they are now providing in Strabane town centre. With their passion for health and wellbeing, their vast experience in alternative therapies and their specialist qualications, Joanne and Stephanie are well positioned within the marketplace and have a bright future ahead of them.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It team on    or visit: www.goforitni. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There is something haunting about the idea of a lost love a relationship that never quite ran its natural course and could be reignited someday. Perhaps it’s not surprising that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and now a new television show from ITV is searching for pining lovers in the Derry area. The team who make ‘Long Lost Family’ have been reuniting people with missing family members for a decade now they want to bring romantic soulmates together after years apart. googletag.cmd.push They have approached Derry Now for help, believing that the recent history of Northern Ireland may have indirectly resulted in a few star-crossed lovers. The turbulence of The Troubles and waves of migration to and from Northern Island in the latter part of the th century mean many couples may have been separated by circumstances. If this sounds like you, they want to hear your story. The programme idea was inspired by the story of KT Robbins, an American serviceman who fell in love with an eighteen-year-old French girl, Jeannine Ganaye in  and recently reunited with her after  years apart. The Derry area has provided similarly heart-warming stories in the past. Avril Trenklet and Bob Fanuce proved that true love never dies when they wed nearly  years after first meeting. Local factory girl, Avril first met US Marine Bob in  when he was stationed at a Naval base in Derry. After a whirlwind romance the couple got engaged but Bob got cold feet and called it off. As the years passed and they got on with their lives, both marrying other people and having families, but Avril says she always knew in her heart that one day they would be together again. One day out of the blue Avril, who was now widowed, got an email from Bob, sparking their reunion and shortly afterwards a second proposal. This time the wedding went ahead and the pair finally got their happy ending. The Long Lost Family team are looking for more lost loves like Bob and Avril. They only intend to reunite people who are currently single and happy to meet as friends … who knows, the spark might still be there.

British Prime Minister Harold Wilsons oft-quoted aphorism proved true once again this week, with the EU granting Britain yet another Brextension.March  came and went, October  the same, then, on Monday past, British Prime Minister Boris Johnston accepted Friday, January , , as the day Britain would, maybe, finally leave the EU. Undeterred by the interminable political machinations, multi- disciplinary artist, Duncan McKellar, on Simdau ast staged his “Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders” fields adjacent to Killeas Church of the Immaculate Conception.Speaking before the event, Mr McKellar said he was “very happy” with the support from the gathering local communities. He had plotted out a -metre-wide circle in two fields taking in both sides of the border with participants standing beside little bamboo markers he had placed in the ground.“It is at the same time, a protest against hard borders and a celebration of the communities around the hard borders. “Hopefully, we will end up with some nice video from the drone and some nice photographs,” he said.Mr McKellar arrived in Killea  days before the “Giant Artwork” took place and said the local “engagement” had been “fantastic.”He said: “People are enthused by the novelty of the idea. There is a palpable warmth. The Irish stereotype holds up very well.“I have been getting lots of help and lots of advice. People have been bending over backwards to help. Just this morning, Ive laid sawdust at the entrance of the field to cover up the mud and Miacuteċeaacutel, who runs the timber merchants, took it round on a truck and said, Anything I can do just let me know.”Introducing himself to the assembled crowd, Mr McKellar explained his work often used mirrors and often took place in border communities. He said: “Last year, I managed to organise a long line which stretched for  kilometre on each side of the US   Mexico border.“We also had a huge group of people on the White Clfs on March , the day Brexit was originally meant to happen. “We sent a giant SOS call to mainland Europe with our mirrors.“With the focus turning to the Northern Ireland border, I thought it was an appropriate time to come here. We are going to form a big circle, to symbolise the strength within the community here and also to show the strength of feeling against hard borders because obviously it used to be right there, the checkpoint.“We will walk to the brow of the hill. The border itself is the Liberty Burn at the bottom of the field. The sun will hit the mirrors and, as well as adding a bit of fairy dust to the images and drone footage, they symbolise the human spirit,” said Duncan.Patrick ODonnell who owns a garage in Killea said he got involved in Duncans Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders to support the artist.Patrick said: “I came along this morning to support Duncan and to protest against Brexit. The artistic aspect of the protest appealed to me.“The idea of hands across the border appealed to me. We dont want a hard border again, we dont want a border at all, basically.“As a business person, I think a hard border would be a disaster, a disaster totally,” said Patrick.The next thing Duncan has in the pipeline is maybe an installation in Palestine. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
